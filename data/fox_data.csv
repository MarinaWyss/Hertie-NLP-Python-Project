"                          VP Pence meets with cruise line executives as 19 coronavirus deaths confirmed in the U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Saturday said the U.S. was engaging in a “whole of America” approach in response to the coronavirus, as he met with cruise line executives and port directors in Florida to discuss if any additional measures need to be taken. “President Trump has no higher priority than the health and safety and well-being of the American people,” Pence said, sitting alongside Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. “It’s the reason why, from the first advent of the coronavirus in America, the president launched a whole of government approach, but as evidenced here today it’s not just a whole of government approach... but it’s really a whole of America approach.” FLORIDA REPORTS 2 DEAD FROM CORONAVIRUS, FIRST KNOWN FATALITIES ON EAST COAST Pence said that the industry had found itself at the ""center"" of America's response to the crisis. He also said efforts were underway to bring the Grand Princess to shore, which has more than 3,500 passengers aboard and has been held off the California coast. Twenty-one people have tested positive for the virus on the ship, and Pence said Saturday that all passengers will be tested and those who have the virus will be quarantined. Pence said the administration has also met with the pharmaceutical industry, nursing home leaders, commercial laboratories and others in an effort to stem the spread of the global virus in America. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE “I speak for President Trump when I say we couldn't be more grateful with the spirit of cooperation from all the American businesses that we’ve engaged and their desire to put the health of America first,” he said. Pence’s remarks come as health officials reported that two people in Florida who tested positive for the virus have died -- making them the first known fatalities outside of California and Washington state. FLA SEN. RICK SCOTT: WE NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE CRUISE INDUSTRY The announcement raised the U.S. death toll from the coronavirus strain to at least 16, including 13 in the state of Washington and one in California, with at least 253 confirmed cases across the country. One of the Floridian deaths was a man with underlying health issues in Santa Rosa County in Florida's Panhandle and the other was an elderly person in Lee County, in the Fort Myers area. In his remarks, Pence highlighted the actions the Trump administration has taken, including declaring a public health emergency, suspending travel from China and now screening 100 percent of all of those who take direct flights from Italy and South Korea. He also praised the “yeoman’s work” by Health and Human Services in expanding testing for the virus. Trump signed an $8.3 billion spending bill this week, significantly higher than the $2.5 billion the administration had initially requested from Congress. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Pence also emphasized that for most Americans, the risk remains low -- noting that the risk is higher for the elderly who already have serious underlying health issues. “The risk of contracting the coronavirus for the average American remains low,” he said. “That being said, we are going to continue to lean into this effort, to call on industry, to call on every agency of government to deal with it.” Fox News’ Caleb Parke and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

"                          Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders battle for the Democratic presidential nomination ahead of the Michigan primary; Fox News senior political correspondent Mike Emanuel reports. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on Saturday expressed doubt that Democratic presidential primary rival Joe Biden can “generate enthusiasm” due to the support he is getting from dozens of billionaires -- while promising to back the former vice president if he is the nominee. “The American people are disgusted with billionaires buying elections. We believe in democracy, one person one vote, not billionaires spending hundreds of millions of dollars ” Sanders told supporters in Dearborn, Mich. “I just don't think that Joe Biden can generate enthusiasm when you got 60 billionaires contributing to his campaign,” he said to boos. DEMOCRACY 2020 DIGEST: BIDEN PRESS SECRETARY SAYS SANDERS IS 'LYING' He went on to accuse Biden's backers of running “ugly” ads against him. The two men have trained their sights on each other after most other candidates have pulled out of the race -- with only Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, as the third remaining candidate. “When you've got, Joe Biden has a Super PAC with billionaires putting money into that Super PAC and right now our campaign has taken on a Super PAC running ugly negative ads against us all over the country,” Sanders said. After Biden scored major wins on Super Tuesday, restoring his status as frontrunner, Sanders has sought to draw a bigger distinction between them -- casting doubt on Biden’s ability to fight for the American people. “At the end of the day, people understand that if you're taking lots of money from billionaires, you’re not going to be there standing up for the working class and the middle class of this country,” he said. MODERATE DEMS BREATHE SIGH OF RELIEF AFTER SUPER TUESDAY BLUNTS SANDERS However, he also said he would support Biden if he got the nod from the Democratic Party, something that Biden has also said about Sanders. ""Because we know how important it is to beat President Trump,"" Sanders said. The remarks indicate the race for the nomination is intensifying. The self-described democratic socialist has targeted Biden since before Super Tuesday, but that has increased since Biden swept 10 of the 14 Super Tuesday states. This week, Sanders accused Biden of supporting banning openly gay Americans from serving in the military when he was in the Senate. Biden campaign national press secretary Jamal Brown responded by saying Sanders was “lying.” “[Biden] is on record saying he didn't have an issue with gays & lesbians in the military,” he said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP With 125 pledged delegates at stake, Michigan is the biggest prize among the six states holding primaries on Tuesday, March 10. Missouri, Mississippi, Washington State, Idaho and North Dakota also hold contests. Sanders told reporters on Thursday: ""Michigan is where we'll spend a bit of our time."" Fox News' Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.

"                          Former Vice President Joe Biden rallies supporters at a Super Tuesday event in Los Angeles, California. The Democratic primary took a dramatic turn on Super Tuesday, with Joe Biden winning at least eight states to continue his comeback story. At the same time, Bernie Sanders took home at least four states, including a win in delegate-rich California, to set up a showdown between the two in the primaries ahead. Maine and the key state of Texas remained extraordinarily close. Preliminary data from surveys in eight states conducted as part of the Fox News Voter Analysis sheds light on why the Super Tuesday results shook out the way they did – though these numbers may change slightly as more results come in.  Biden’s resounding win on Saturday in South Carolina gave him a much-needed boost and pushed fellow moderates Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg out of the race. Klobuchar, Buttigieg, and former presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke all endorsed Biden at an event in Dallas on Monday night, bolstering the sense of a campaign gathering steam.  BIDEN SURGES TO VICTORY ACROSS SUPER TUESDAY MAP, AS SANDERS CLAIMS DELEGATE PRIZE IN CALIFORNIA Late-deciding voters clearly bought into the idea that Biden was still in the game. More than a quarter of voters in each state said they made up their minds in the last few days – including more than half of those in Minnesota. Biden won late deciders by at least 15 points in every state but California, and by roughly 30 points or more in Virginia, Alabama, Minnesota, and North Carolina.  Sanders’ main sources of strength continue to be young and very liberal voters. He won better than four-in-10 voters under age 30 in each Super Tuesday state, topping out at 60 percent in a trio of states. Similarly, Sanders won at least four-in-10 of those who called themselves “very liberal” in each state.  By contrast, Biden’s base was seniors and, to a lesser degree, political moderates. He won at least four-in-10 voters over age 65 in every state except California, Colorado, and Massachusetts.  Among both seniors and moderates, Mike Bloomberg’s presence in the race appears to have complicated Biden’s path to victory. Roughly two-in-10 seniors in each state (except Minnesota and Massachusetts) backed the former mayor, and he picked up roughly 15 percent of the moderate vote or more in each state.  The Sanders campaign invested heavily in outreach to the Latino community, and it paid off in the states with the largest Hispanic populations. Biden narrowly edged Bloomberg as Latinos’ second choice.  Sanders’ strength among Latinos was balanced by Biden’s success with black voters. Biden won roughly half of the black vote (or better) in every state except for California (36 percent). Sanders’ best performance among black voters was 26 percent in North Carolina, followed by 24 percent in California.  Biden won white voters in Alabama, Virginia, and Minnesota; Sanders won whites in Colorado, and the two were deadlocked (or nearly so) in the remaining states.  Whites without a college degree went for Sanders by double-digit margins in Colorado and backed Biden by 11 percentage points in Alabama and 15 points in Virginia. The margins among this group in the other states were razor-thin.  The best groups for Bloomberg tended to overlap directly with sources of Biden’s strength: seniors, blacks, and political moderates. Biden’s late surge, however, effectively pushed Bloomberg off the map – the billionaire got less than two-in-10 late-deciding voters in each state.  Adding to Bloomberg’s difficult night was a failure to connect on his signature issues. Despite committing a considerable amount of his personal fortune to gun control and combating climate change, he won no more than two-in-10 voters who prioritized those issues in each state. Similarly, Bloomberg’s attempt to position himself as the candidate most likely to beat President Trump fell short – in each state, he got 20 percent or less among those who said beating President Trump was a very important quality for their nominee.  Most Super Tuesday voters – six-in-10 in most states, with a high of 73 percent in Minnesota – said it was important to them that a woman be elected president in their lifetime. Elizabeth Warren won 29 percent of these voters in Massachusetts, but still lost her adopted home state. In each other state, she won less than a quarter of those who wanted to see a female president in their lifetime.   Issues and policies As in the early primary states, more Super Tuesday voters wanted a candidate who would bring fundamental change to the political system than one who would restore it to the way it was before the Trump administration. That was particularly true in California and Colorado, two of the best states for Sanders.  At the same time, about six-in-10 voters wanted a candidate offering practical, centrist policies over one promising bold liberal ideas – even in more liberal states like California.   Biden won “restore” voters in each state, while Sanders won “change” voters everywhere except for Alabama (where they went for Biden). Similarly, voters wanting centrist policies opted for Biden in each state, and those seeking bold liberal ideas went for Sanders everywhere save Alabama (where, again, Biden won).  Despite divisions about the tone and tenor of their candidates’ approaches, Democrats were largely united in their opinions on key issues and policies. Health care topped voters’ issue list, with at least one-third in each state citing it as the most important issue facing the country. The economy and jobs was second in most of the Southern states (cited by roughly two-in-10 voters). Outside of the South, voters were more likely to mention climate change as their second-place concern (between 26 percent in California and 32 percent in Colorado).  On health care, more than eight-in-10 voters in each state favored a public option approach, while roughly two-thirds in each state backed a Sanders-style single payer plan.  Primary voters also broadly agreed on taxing the use of carbon-based fuels (support ranged between 62 percent in Alabama and 87 percent in Minnesota), marijuana legalization (72 percent in Virginia and Texas to 84 percent in Colorado), and reducing the criminal justice system’s focus on low-level offenses (78 percent in Alabama to 85 percent in Colorado). Fully nine-in-10 primary voters in Colorado and California favored limiting the amount of money presidential candidates and campaigns could spend, while support for the idea was slightly lower in Texas (85 percent) and Alabama (78 percent).  Democrats divided? Majorities of voters in each state would be satisfied if Biden, Sanders, or Warren were the eventual nominee. Overall satisfaction was slightly higher for Biden (ranging between 58 percent in Colorado and 81 percent in Alabama) than for Sanders (a low of 55 in Virginia and a high of 67 in California) or Warren (60 in Virginia to 71 in Colorado).  It was a different story for Bloomberg, as satisfaction ranged from a low of 39 (Colorado and Minnesota) to a high of 61 (Alabama). In five states, majorities would be dissatisfied if he captured the nomination. Across all states, nearly half of Biden and Bloomberg voters would be dissatisfied with Sanders as the nominee, while roughly six-in-ten Sanders supporters would be dissatisfied with Biden. Majorities of Warren voters would be satisfied with either Biden or Sanders as the nominee.  Sanders’ voters’ dissatisfaction could be amplified by concerns about the fairness of the nomination process. While roughly two-thirds of Super Tuesday voters overall had confidence in the process, a majority of Sanders voters felt the process was unfair.  Roughly three-quarters of voters (or more) in each state said they would definitely support the Democratic candidate in November against Trump, with Minnesota voters showing the most party solidarity (84 percent).  In several key swing states, however, two-in-ten voters said their decision in November would depend on who won the Democratic nomination. Warren voters were the most likely to say they would support the Democrat regardless of who won; Sanders and Bloomberg supporters were the least likely. Still, at least three-quarters of each candidate’s supporters said they would back the eventual nominee no matter what.  Texas and California The two largest prizes of the night – Texas and California – were a study in contrasts. Sanders was dominant throughout California, with Biden a distant second and both Bloomberg and Warren hovering around the 15 percent viability threshold for delegates. In Texas, on the other hand, Sanders and Biden were neck-and-neck, with Bloomberg lurking in third and Warren a distant fourth.  In California, Sanders led among most demographic groups, with the exception of moderates (with whom Biden led by 6 points), voters ages 45 and over (Biden +7 points) and black voters (Biden +12 points).  Sanders’ strongest groups in California – as they were across the country – were young voters, very liberal voters, and Latinos. He also won nearly four-in-ten voters without a college degree.  Biden’s strength with late-deciding voters helped him hold down Sanders’ delegate gains out of the Golden State.  Perhaps the most competitive – and consequential – battleground of the night was Texas, where Bloomberg played a major role. White voters split between the two leaders (27 percent for Biden and 25 for Sanders), while Bloomberg picked up 17 percent and Warren 13 percent. Sanders nearly doubled Biden’s support among Latinos, and Biden returned the favor by dominating among black Texans. Warren was unable to attract significant nonwhite support in the state.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Texans were much more likely to favor a public option approach to health care (87 percent) than single payer (63 percent) – and yet more felt Sanders would be best able to handle health care than Biden.  Methodology The Fox News Voter Analysis, conducted in partnership with The Associated Press, provides a comprehensive look at voting behavior, opinions and preferences as America votes. On Super Tuesday, surveys were conducted in Alabama, California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. The surveys were conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago the week before the primaries, concluding as polls closed. Interviews were conducted in English or Spanish. The survey is based on interviews with a random sample of registered voters drawn from the state voter file. In California, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Texas, and Virginia, these probability sample results were supplemented by interviews with self-identified registered voters recruited from nonprobability online panels. The sample sizes for the surveys ranged from 1,168 (Alabama) to 3,976 (California), with margins of sampling error ranging between plus or minus 4.9 and 3.0 percentage points.

"                          Some Republicans are reportedly growing concerned about the virus' impact on the stock market and Americans' sense of security heading into the election; reaction and analysis on 'Outnumbered.' By a 20-point margin, voters say the Trump administration has mostly succeeded at stimulating the economy: 51 percent think that and 31 percent believe he has mostly failed. In addition, by a 19-point margin, more think the administration has mostly succeeded at creating jobs (50 percent succeeded, 31 percent failed). These are two of nine national priorities the latest Fox News Poll asks voters about.  The findings indicate success in some areas, while others need improvement -- including security. CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS The poll, released Friday, also finds more voters say they are better off than they were four years ago (35 percent) than worse off (24 percent).  The largest number, however, feels their situation is about the same (40 percent).  Nearly three times as many Republicans (58 percent) as Democrats (19 percent) say they are better off today. The president’s worst rating is on unifying the country: 59 percent say Trump has mostly failed (19 percent mostly succeeded).  Almost as many think he has mostly failed at improving race relations (55 percent), and many say the same about improving health care (50 percent failed). Voters are less than wowed with the job Trump has done on his “drain the swamp in Washington” promise -- 48 percent call that a failure (21 percent succeeded). Views are more mixed on security issues.  On making the country safer, voters say the administration has mostly failed by 7 points (38 succeeded, 45 failed). And despite the expansion of the U.S.-Mexico border wall, voters divide over whether Trump has been effective on his signature issue of border security (40 succeeded, 42 failed). On handling the Islamic extremist group ISIS, voters split:  39 percent mostly succeeded vs. 38 percent mostly failed. For comparison, voters believed the Obama administration had mostly failed on many of these same priorities as his term started to wind down. In January 2016, majorities gave failing grades for stimulating the economy (51 percent mostly failed), improving health care (53 percent), making the country safer (58 percent), improving race relations (59 percent), and handling ISIS (65 percent). In general, 47 percent of voters approve of Trump’s job performance and 52 percent disapprove.  That is a tad better than last month when it was 45-54 percent (January 2020).  The president’s best rating continues to be 48 percent approve vs. 47 percent disapprove in February 2017, soon after his inauguration.  His record low was 38 percent approval in October 2017. Fully 89 percent of Republicans are happy with Trump’s performance. And, his job approval stands at a record high of 14 percent among Democrats. Overall, a majority of voters approve of how Trump’s handling the economy (54 approve, 42 disapprove) -- yet a majority disapproves on health care (38 approve, 53 disapprove). Poll Pourri -- Most voters are at least somewhat confident the federal government is prepared to deal with the coronavirus (74 percent).  A smaller majority feels confident U.S. intelligence agencies are prepared to deal with the Russian government trying to interfere in the next presidential election (68 percent). -- On the Senate impeachment trial, voters approve of Trump’s acquittal (50-44 percent). -- Views split on Trump’s recent presidential pardons.  Forty-nine percent think they were an abuse of pardon power, while 43 percent call them “fairly typical.”  In February 2001, 55 percent said pardons by former President Clinton were an abuse of power and 32 percent said typical. -- Voters remain unhappy with lawmakers in Washington:  26 percent approve of the job Congress is doing and 65 percent disapprove. -- Nearly half of voters, 49 percent, disapprove of Trump’s tweeting.  That’s more than double the 19 percent who approve.  Another 28 percent “wish he’d be more cautious.” Conducted February 23-26, 2020 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,000 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones.  The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points for all registered voters.

"                          Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Capitalism beats socialism by a two-to-one margin in the latest Fox News Poll. By a 26-point spread, voters have a more positive than negative view of capitalism (56 favorable - 30 unfavorable). The opposite holds true for socialism, where sentiment is net negative by 30 points (28 favorable - 58 unfavorable). CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS That’s almost exactly where things stood a year ago, despite the popularity of Sen. Bernie Sanders', I-Vt., presidential campaign. The Democratic presidential frontrunner says “billionaires should not exist,” yet 76 percent of voters overall and 67 percent of Democrats think it’s a good thing people can become billionaires in the United States. For many though, there are limits.  Voters agree by a 56-35 percent margin the government “should increase taxes on the wealthiest individuals so that nobody gets to be too rich.”  A decade ago, it was the reverse: 40 percent favored increased taxes and 55 percent disagreed. Billionaires, generically, garner somewhat negative ratings in the poll (35 favorable - 44 unfavorable).  Mere millionaires are a bit more popular (41 favorable - 39 unfavorable).  One in five voters is unable to give an opinion of either millionaires or billionaires. Views among groups Twice as many Democrats (40 percent) as Republicans (15 percent) feel positively about socialism. Republicans (67 percent) are more likely than Democrats (50 percent) to have a favorable view of capitalism. Men are 26 points more likely than women to have a favorable view of capitalism (70 vs. 44 percent).  That gender gap disappears on socialism, as roughly equal numbers of men (29 percent) and women (27 percent) feel positively. Voters ages 65 and over are far more likely than those under age 35 to like capitalism (72 vs. 44 percent), and young voters are more than twice as likely as seniors to have a favorable view of socialism (35 vs. 16 percent). CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Democratic primary voters who back Sanders in the nomination race have a net positive view of socialism by 17 points (49 favorable - 32 unfavorable), and a net negative view of capitalism (by 15 points) and billionaires (by 59 points).  Some 74 percent of Sanders’ supporters have an unfavorable opinion of billionaires.

"                          As young voters embrace Sen. Bernie Sanders' promises of 'free' college and health care, a new study shows only 16 percent of millennials are 'financially literate.' Bernie Sanders pushes Joe Biden out of the frontrunner spot for the Democratic nomination, capturing a record 31 percent support among primary voters in a new Fox News Poll. This is the first 2020 Fox national poll that finds Biden not leading the Democratic race. The survey also finds a marked increase in the number of voters who think President Trump will win the election. Sanders has gained 8 percentage points since January in the nomination race, while Biden drops into second with 18 percent, down 8 points. Close behind is Mike Bloomberg at 16 percent, up 6 points since last month and triple his 5 percent in December. Pete Buttigieg comes in at 12 percent (up 5), Elizabeth Warren at 10 percent (down 4), and Amy Klobuchar at 5 percent (up 2). This is the first Fox News poll with five candidates in double digits. It was conducted Sunday through Wednesday. Sanders, notably, was the most attacked candidate during Tuesday’s contentious presidential debate in South Carolina. Sanders performs well with groups across the board, with an extra boost from young voters, self-described liberals, whites without a college degree, and those looking for change. Biden is strongest among women over age 45, voters who regularly attend religious services, and those who long for a return to the pre-Trump era. CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS The nomination race looks almost the same when narrowed to Democratic primary voters in the 14 Super Tuesday states: Sanders remains on top with 30 percent, followed by Bloomberg at 18 percent, Biden 17 percent, Warren 11 percent, and Buttigieg and Klobuchar each get 8 percent. Overall, majorities of primary voters think Sanders (65 percent), Bloomberg (57 percent) and Biden (56 percent) can beat Donald Trump. Since December, the number believing Sanders can win is up 5 points (was 60 percent). But Democratic voters’ faith in most of the other candidates is shaken since December. The portion saying Biden can win is down 21 points (from 77 percent), while Warren (-22 points) and Buttigieg (-12) also saw declines. Democrats remain divided on central questions facing their party. By a 10-point margin, more want a nominee who will fundamentally change how the political system works (52 percent) than want someone who will restore the system to pre-Trump administration (42 percent). There is a similar divide over whether they prefer a nominee who is a pragmatist or a visionary: by a 9-point margin, more are looking for a candidate who will pursue “practical centrist” policies (49 percent) than want someone who will pursue “bold liberal” plans (40 percent). Sanders leads by more than 30 points among “bold liberal” voters, while support among “practical centrist” voters splinters: Biden (21 percent), Bloomberg (20 percent), Sanders (19 percent) and Buttigieg (15 percent). Those wanting change prefer Sanders by more than 20 percentage points. Biden is the favorite for those wanting to hit reset, although he leads by a narrower 9-point margin. It’s important not to overstate these differences, as Sanders is the second choice among restore voters and Bloomberg comes in second among change voters. More primary voters think Biden’s policies are realistic (67 percent), than say the same about Bloomberg (57 percent realistic), Buttigieg (55 percent), Sanders (53 percent), Warren (49 percent), and Klobuchar (44 percent). When asked if there is a candidate primary voters could not support, Bloomberg and Sanders (18 percent each) have the largest number saying they would refuse to vote for them in November, followed by Biden and Warren (13 percent apiece) and Tulsi Gabbard (10 percent). Forty-five percent of Democratic primary voters say they would vote for any one of the current candidates over Trump. There is no hurry to narrow the field. Fifty-four percent of primary voters want candidates to stay in the race even if they failed to finish in the top three in any of the early contests. What’s more, by a 50-38 percent margin, they say the Democratic Party should have the flexibility to nominate someone else if no candidate has a majority of delegates at the convention. Sanders, as the candidate currently best positioned to win the most delegates, thinks the candidate with the delegate lead should win the nomination, even if it isn’t a majority. The other top candidates support flexibility if no candidate has a majority. In general, 75 percent of all Democratic primary voters and 67 percent of Sanders supporters feel confident the Democratic Party’s process of picking a nominee is fair. 2020 general election Among all voters, all six Democratic candidates tested top the president in trial ballots. Trump trails Biden and Bloomberg by 8 points and Sanders by 7. Those are the only leads outside the poll’s margin of error.  Warren (+3 points), Buttigieg (+3) and Klobuchar (+1) are barely ahead. And in each instance, there are enough undecided/third-party voters to move the race either way. Forty-two percent would vote to re-elect Trump if the election were today. That’s up from 38 percent in May 2019 and the largest share he’s received to-date. On the other side, a majority of 52 percent would vote for someone else. That puts the president underwater by 10 points, an improvement from a net negative of 16 points in May 2019. At the extremes: 32 percent would definitely vote for Trump vs. 45 would definitely back someone else. Despite those findings, 56 percent think Trump will be re-elected. That’s up from 44 percent in October.  Expectations increased among Republicans (+9 points) and Democrats (+16). Eight years ago, 52 percent thought former President Obama would be re-elected. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Poll Pourri Biden (50 percent) and Sanders (49 percent) have the highest favorable ratings -- and have more who view them positively than negatively. Biden’s net favorability rating is best (+4 points), followed by Sanders (+2), and Buttigieg (+1). Klobuchar is net neutral, and the ratings for Warren (-4), Steyer (-7), Bloomberg (-8), and Trump (-11) are underwater. Voters favor giving everyone the option to buy into Medicare by a 67-23 percent margin and making minor changes to Obamacare by 58-32 percent. A 49-percent plurality opposes getting rid of private insurance and moving to a government-run health care system (42 percent favor). Among Democratic primary voters, 76 percent favor the public option (Buttigieg’s position), 74 percent favor mostly keeping Obamacare (Biden), and 56 percent favor a government-run plan (Sanders and Warren). The poll, released Thursday, asks Democratic primary voters if any candidates may not be physically healthy enough to carry out the job of president. Sanders is the most frequently mentioned at 30 percent, followed by Biden at 16 percent. Nearly one in five Sanders supporters thinks he may lack what it takes to do the job physically. Among all voters, 63 percent think presidential candidates should be required to release their full medical records, and 70 percent say the same about tax returns. When it comes to Democratic primary voters, there is an even larger desire for full disclosure: 72 percent want to see full medical records and 90 percent want to see tax returns. Conducted February 23-26, 2020 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,000 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points for all registered voters and 4 points for Democratic primary voters (507).

"                          Fox News has confirmed the departure of Corbin Trent from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's re-election campaign. He was the campaign’s spokesman and former leader at Justice Democrats. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is coming under fire after urging illegal immigrants to participate in the upcoming census -- with opponents saying her language was “anti-American,” ""We're all going to get mailed a prompt to fill out the census in the next two weeks or so,"" she said Thursday on “Late Night with Seth Meyers.” ""And so I think what’s really important is that we all fill this out. It happens once every 10 years.” FACEBOOK DROPS TRUMP ADS AFTER PELOSI CITES CENSUS CONFUSION “Every single person, no matter your documentation status, no matter your housing status, income, etc., is to be counted,” she said, before assuring viewers that the data included is “completely confidential” and not shared with other agencies. “So don’t worry if you’re having a creative living situation, it’s not going to be told to your landlord or anything crazy like that,” she added. The census is a once-a-decade population count that determines how $1.5 trillion in federal spending is allocated, and also how many congressional seats each state gets. The Census Bureau notes that it counts “our population and households” in the U.S. The remarks come after she shared a video, distributed by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's office, and emphasized that ""you will NOT be asked about immigration status."" Ocasio-Cortez’s remarks angered at least one New York lawmaker -- who said her rhetoric was “anti-American.” “Illegal aliens should not be counted equally to law-abiding Americans and legal immigrants – plain and simple,” Assemblyman Mike LiPetri said in a statement.  “When radical left-wing politicians like AOC make such statements, she sends a message to all Americans and legal immigrants that it doesn’t matter if you work hard and play by the rules, we’re going to prioritize criminals and those here illegally over you.” AOC CLAIMS BIDEN 'OVERPERFORMED' SUPER TUESDAY BECAUSE HIS CAMPAIGN FACED 'LOW EXPECTATIONS'  Ocasio-Cortez’s push for those in the country illegally to fill out the census is part of a broader fight over the census, which saw the Trump administration try to include a question on citizenship in the census. That move was scrapped after the Supreme Court ruled against the administration, with Democrats claiming that even asking the question could spook illegal immigrants from filling out the entire census. The question however, did not ask whether a non-citizen was here illegally or not, just whether they were a citizen. A number of Democratic states and localities, including New York and California, are estimated to have large numbers of illegal immigrants and the amount of funding they receive -- something determined by the census -- rests in part of how many of them they can get to fill out the form. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump in July last year accused Democrats of trying to “conceal the number of illegal aliens in our midst.” This is part of a broader left-wing effort to erode the rights of the American citizen,” he said. “And it’s very unfair to our country.”    ",         Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calls on illegal immigrants to fill out 2020 census,         2020-03-07T091229-0500,https://foxnews.com/politics/ocasio-cortez-illegal-immigrants-2020-census,Fox
"                          Democratic presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard addresses preparations that need to be made to protect the U.S. from a coronavirus outbreak. The only woman remaining in the 2020 race for the White House is calling on her party's top two competitors to help pressure the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to allow her to participate in an upcoming presidential debate in Phoenix. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, is now one of only three Democratic candidates still running for president. On Super Tuesday, March 3, she walked away with two delegates from American Samoa, which would have helped her qualify in the previous debate, held Feb. 25 in Charleston, S.C. However, the DNC released a new requirement for the March 15 Phoenix debate. Participants for that contest must have at least 20 percent of the pledged delegates, which means only the two leaders -- former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. -- qualify. 'THE VIEW' LAUGHS OFF TULSI GABBARD AFTER SHE WON DELEGATE ON SUPER TUESDAY: 'PUT A FORK IN IT!' On Friday night, Gabbard took to social media and appealed to Biden and Sanders to let her join them on the debate stage once again. ""@JoeBiden @Bernie Sanders I’m sure you would agree that our Democratic nominee should be a person who will stand up for what is right. So I ask that you have the courage to do that now in the face of the DNC's effort to keep me from participating in the debates,"" Gabbard tweeted. She then called out the DNC for changing the debate requirements to allow Mike Bloomberg onto the debate stage. ""To keep me off the stage, the DNC again arbitrarily changed the debate qualifications. Previously they changed the qualifications in the OPPOSITE direction so Bloomberg could debate. I ask that you stand w/ me against the DNC’s transparent effort to exclude me from the debates. #LetTulsiDebate,"" she said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The hashtag #LetTulsiDebate trended on Twitter throughout Friday evening. Gabbard has not appeared on at a Democratic debate since November.

"                          Sen. Elizabeth Warren expresses disappointment that little girls will have to wait four more years for the chance of a female president; reaction and analysis on 'Outnumbered.' Now that Elizabeth Warren has bowed to the inevitable, the Biden-Bernie matchup is either a battle for the soul of the Democratic Party…or the typical dust-settling of a conventional race. That is, one establishment candidate, a veteran, battle-scarred establishment type who is not terribly exciting, and an insurgent candidate, a colorful, more ideological provocateur who makes followers swoon. In this view, the voters who gave Joe Biden 10 Super Tuesday victories were simply coming home after flirting with two dozen potential dates. Biden was the safe, dependable choice for those whose main goal is beating President Trump—and that includes some who feel more affinity with Bernie Sanders. Usually, this plays out over a couple of months, and the race is hardly over. But in the space of four days, Biden transformed his fortunes and, in what had seemed unthinkable, passed Sanders in the delegate count. It didn’t hurt that Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg closed ranks behind him, followed by Mike Bloomberg, or that he was lifted aloft by his first sustained burst of positive press. But the breadth of his coalition—African-Americans, working classes, suburban dwellers and older voters—suggests he was always a likely front-runner once folks were convinced he could win. BLOOMBERG INVESTMENT BOMBS AS PRESS BELATEDLY BOOSTS BIDEN It was, as John Harris puts it in Politico, “a signal that not all the old ways of thinking about national politics are defunct in an age of disruption.” The 2008 contest was the exception, with newcomer Obama toppling semi-incumbent Hillary. But Harris recites the history: “Jimmy Carter in 1980, Walter Mondale in 1984, Bill Clinton in 1992, John Kerry in 2004, Hillary Clinton in 2016—the party has ultimately coalesced over the more consensus-oriented politician in the spring after a flirtation with more flamboyant or purely ideological insurgents.” And that means Gary Hart, Paul Tsongas, Howard Dean, Bill Bradley—and Bernie last time—didn’t win. The very factors that made Biden seem like a plodding war horse—nearly four decades in the Senate, eight as vice president, lots of political baggage—were why a majority of Democrats have so far decided that he’d be a reassuring choice as commander-in-chief. And that brings us to why the race is now down to a 77-year-old Democrat, a 78-year-old independent and a 73-year-old president. When Warren emerged from her Cambridge home and made some humble withdrawal comments, MSNBC reporter Ali Vitali asked: “I wonder what your message would be to the women and girls who feel like we’re left with two old white men to decide between?” (We’re left with.) SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES Warren replied that “one of the hardest parts of this is all those pinky promises and all those little girls who are going to have to wait four more years. That’s going to be hard.” The problem with this question is that Warren was riding a wave of favorable press and voter support when she was leading the polls last fall. Then she started making mistakes, from embracing and then fudging on Medicare for All to migrating from an unabashed progressive to a “unity” candidate. Of course there is sexism in the press and in society. But that didn’t stop Hillary from winning the nomination and the popular vote. Warren, Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand didn’t drop out because America is wedded to male septuagenarians; they just failed to get sufficient traction. Here’s a different view of the former Harvard law professor from Megan Garber in the Atlantic: “Warren had something about her, apparently: something that galled the pundits and the public in a way that led to assessments of her not just as ‘strident’ and ‘shrill,’ but also as ‘condescending.’ The matter is not merely that the candidate is unlikable, these deployments of condescending imply. The matter is instead that her unlikability has a specific source, beyond bias and internalized misogyny.  “Warren knows a lot, and has accomplished a lot, and is extremely competent, condescending acknowledges, before twisting the knife: It is precisely because of those achievements that she represents a threat. Condescending attempts to rationalize an irrational prejudice…When I hear her talk, I want to slap her, even when I agree with her.” Running for president is brutal; only one person prevails in each party. Everyone’s personality is mocked; Joe Biden is routinely portrayed as a rambling, forgetful geezer. In “SNL” terms, Kate McKinnon is Warren the know-it-all; Larry David is Bernie the ranting relative; Alec Baldwin is Trump the know-nothing. Maybe it comes down to the fact that this was the first presidential campaign for Warren, who got into politics less than a decade ago, but the second for Sanders and the third for Biden. The former veep will need that experience, if he’s the nominee, going up against another political newcomer who has come to dominate American politics.

"                           Mike Bloomberg didn’t need one of his fancy Wall Street terminals to interpret the data that he got shellacked on Super Tuesday. And faster than anyone might have imagined, he got out of the race and backed Joe Biden. Bloomberg’s return on his $500-million investment: not much, though he’ll always have American Samoa. It was a stark reminder that money—even massive amounts of money on a scale never before seen in American politics—can’t buy a nomination. And an equally dramatic reminder that the press makes the same mistake every four years, conflating big bucks with political strength. Bloomberg, who never recovered from that Vegas debate debacle, was smart to call it quits, and his considerable fortune will certainly help Biden, especially if the former VP prevails against Bernie Sanders and has to battle the Trump machine. BIDEN SHOCKS THE PUNDITS, AGAIN, WITH SURPRISINGLY STRONG SUPER TUESDAY Politicians and the press always overstate the importance of money and organization. They matter, but not as much as the candidate and the message. That mistake has been made again and again, with candidates ranging from Phil Gramm to Jeb Bush to, well, Donald Trump, who was massively outspent in 2016. And how many pieces did I have to read about Elizabeth Warren’s awesome field operation? That didn’t stop her from being clobbered again and again, even finishing third in her home state of Massachusetts. When the press was portraying Biden as having one foot in the political grave, Bloomberg became the new savior—especially for many in the party who feared a Bernie nomination would be disastrous. And it’s true that as he blitzed the airwaves, he moved up in the polls. But Bloomberg was damaged by reports of things he’d done and said as a Republican, especially stop and frisk, and was less than impressive when he finally came out from behind the curtain to do a couple of interviews. In the end, the money didn’t matter. Voters deserted him en masse as soon as Biden seemed viable again. In a way, the former vice president ought to thank the press for performing last rites on his struggling campaign. It made his victories in Virginia, Massachusetts, Maine, North Carolina, Alabama, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Minnesota and Texas seem absolutely miraculous. The way in which so much of the press had declared Biden finished, kaput, washed up after Iowa and New Hampshire was nothing short of journalistic malpractice. “Drop out, Joe Biden. New Hampshire proves you are done,” said a Business Insider headline. SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES Everyone knew those two small, largely white states were rough terrain for Biden, and yet it didn’t matter. Even after his blowout win in South Carolina, many journalists said he couldn’t possibly be competitive in 14 states because he didn’t have the money and organization (there are those words again). It didn’t matter. A strong ground game is great when a candidate is connecting. But the dogs have to like the dog food. The two-day interval between South Carolina and Super Tuesday turned out to be perfect for Biden. Peaking at the right time is political gold. Another week would have given him more time to raise money, but also more time for Sanders to sharpen his attacks and for unexpected events to intervene. The candidate, of course, deserves substantial credit. Biden got better as he grew in confidence. He was often photographed, by design, interacting with average votes, not a Sanders or Bloomberg specialty. His two victory speeches were tightly scripted rather than an attempt to thank everyone in the room. But the press should be careful about this latest swing of the pendulum. Biden is the same guy who not long ago was being derided for stupid gaffes, shaky debate performances and meandering speeches. Sanders still has a passionate following and substantial number of delegates. The same journalists who said Biden couldn’t win shouldn’t fall into the trap of now saying he can’t lose.

Hillary Clinton may not have yet given her endorsement for her party’s presidential nomination this year, but that doesn’t mean she’s not weighing in on who she thinks will be the best – or the worst - candidate to go up against President Trump this fall.  Clinton, who lost the 2016 general election to Trump, said of  Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders: ""I do not think he's our strongest nominee against Donald Trump.” But she stopped short of throwing her endorsement behind former Vice President Joe Biden. Speaking on CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS,” Clinton – who faced a surprisingly tough nomination in 2016 from Sanders – has been highly critical of the Vermont lawmaker throughout the 2020 election season, but this is the former secretary of state’s first comments since the race to take on Trump basically became a two-man contest following Super Tuesday.  HILLARY CLINTON UNLEASHES ON BERNIE SANDERS IN NEW DOCUMENTARY: 'NOBODY LIKES HIM' While Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, has yet to exit the race, the Democratic nomination is now firmly a battle between Sanders and Biden. Clinton’s slam on Sanders comes just days after she called his campaign and platform “baloney” and ripped his claims that he is taking on Washington elites. ""He was a career politician,” she said during an interview on ABC's ""Good Morning America.""  “It's all just baloney and I feel so bad that people got sucked into it.” In regards to Biden, Clinton did not come out with an outright endorsement of the former vice president, but praised the “coalition” he is building and the momentum he has generated since his wins on Super Tuesday. “I think what Joe’s victories on Super Tuesday showed is that he is building the kind of coalition that I had basically,” Clinton said. “It’s a broad-based coalition. I finished, you know, most of the work I needed to do for the nomination on Super Tuesday, and then it kind of lingered on — and I think Joe is on track to doing exactly the same thing — putting together a coalition of voters who are energized.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Clinton, who last month said she would support Sanders should he win the Democratic nomination, told CNN that she hopes Sanders and his backers would go in for Biden should the former vice president secure the Democratic nomination. “I hope so because his failure and the behavior of a lot of his top aides, and certainly many of his supporters — up to the convention, at the convention, and even up to Election Day was not helpful,” she said, recalling Sanders’ actions during the 2016 election. She added: “I had thought we would unify, that's what we'd always done before and that's what I expected. I certainly tried to do that when I ran against Barack Obama and worked very hard for him.”    ",         Hillary Clinton says Sanders would not be Dems strongest candidate to beat Trump,         2020-03-08T122846-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/hillary-clinton-says-sanders-would-not-be-dems-strongest-candidate-to-beat-trump,Fox
"                          Reaction from former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise. Hunter Biden should be held in contempt for continuing to defy a court order to turn over his financial information, flaunting his lack of ""respect"" for the legal process and undermining the interests of the child he has previously refused to support or even acknowledge, according to a blistering new filing from the mother of Biden's child in an ongoing paternity case. The motion comes as Joe Biden has surged to front-runner status in the Democrats' presidential primary amid new questions over whether his son may have corruptly benefited from his father's position as vice president. The case threatens to surface new information about the younger Biden's overseas dealings in Ukraine, China and elsewhere during the Obama administration -- and his father's apparent knowledge of those arrangements. ""After months of hiding, one has to wonder if the reason Hunter Biden continues to defy the court is because there are financial documents that could shed light on his father’s massive conflicts of interest as vice president,"" Republican National Committee (RNC) spokesman Steve Guest told Fox News on Sunday. The filing from 28-year-old Lunden Alexis Roberts' legal team wastes little time in charging that Hunter Biden ""continues to act as though he has no respect for this Court, its orders, the legal process in this state, or the needs of his child for support."" It argues that the court ""should take some action that will make the defendant follow court orders and a believer in the rule of law."" Specifically, Biden has not turned over information concerning his address, financial institutions he or his businesses use, a list of all the companies he ""currently owns or in which he has an ownership interest and the state in which those companies are incorporated,"" or a list of ""all sources of income for the past five years."" HUNTER BIDEN'S SCANDALS EXPLAINED: UKRAINE, COCAINE, AND MORE       U.S. Vice President Joe Biden (L) waves as he walks out of Air Force Two with his granddaughter Finnegan Biden and son Hunter Biden at the airport in Beijing December 4, 2013. The younger Biden's business dealings are coming under scrutiny as House Democrats push forward with an impeachment inquiry into President Trump for allegedly pressuring the Ukranian President to investigate the Biden family for political gain.      (Reuters) Additionally, Biden has failed to produce a list of all ""employers for the past five years,"" an unredacted copy of his tax returns, deeds for properties he owns, and tax documents for companies in which he has any ownership interest. The previous judge in the case, Don McSpadden, said in December that Biden was ""going to have to provide at least the last three years of tax returns."" A Dec. 4 court order required Biden to turn over at a minimum ""five most recent paystubs or five previous years"" of tax returns; and a later order mandated both sides provide ""their personal tax returns for the past five years; and ... any and all financial documents and information showing money or monies they received in the past five years."" Independence County Circuit Court Judge Holly Meyer, who now oversees the case, has said those orders are still in effect. Biden's conduct is ""willful and contemptuous,"" according to Roberts' lawyers, and he should be ordered to appear in person at a March 13 hearing to explain why he should not be held in contempt. WHOOPS: BIDEN CAMPAIGN TOUTS UKRAINE ACTIVIST WHO CALLED HUNTER'S ACTIONS 'VERY BAD' Meyer had previously ordered Biden to appear in person for the same reason, but Biden temporarily avoided being held in contempt when he agreed to pay an undisclosed monthly child support amount. At the time, Meyer noted she ""lacks sufficient information"" about Biden's finances to determine the appropriate child support totals, and delayed contempt proceedings until March 1. Those proceedings now appeared likely to resume this week. The younger Biden is also slated to appear at a deposition on March 11, despite his efforts to quash the deposition and obtain a protective order (“He needs to make himself available unless his hair is on fire,” Meyer said during a conference call with the attorneys on the case last month, according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.) ""After months of hiding, one has to wonder if the reason Hunter Biden continues to defy the court is because there are financial documents that could shed light on his father’s massive conflicts of interest as vice president."" The New York Times reported last week that the 50-year-old Hunter Biden is spending his time attempting to pass himself off as a painter in a rented $12,000-per-month hideout in Hollywood Hills while driving a Porsche. The paternity case established that Hunter Biden was the father of Roberts' baby after a DNA test. Roberts had argued that Biden was essentially an absent father, and the younger Biden had repeatedly denied paternity until the DNA test. Republicans, and even some left-of-center commentators and career State Department employees, have said Biden appeared to be trading on his access to his father as part of a career of illicit dealings -- raising the prospect that the financial documents could shed additional light on their accusations. Top Republican senators recently requested travel records from the Secret Service that might shed light on Hunter Biden's dealings in China, which President Trump has long said merit a state investigation. The paternity dispute has presented headaches for the elder Biden ever since a court filing showed that DNA results indicated he was now a grandfather. Joe Biden tangled with a Fox News reporter on camera when asked about that development last November. ""I'm wondering if you have a comment on this report, and court filing, out of Arkansas, that your son Hunter just made you a grandfather again,"" Fox News’ Peter Doocy asked. ""No, that’s a private matter and I have no comment,"" Biden fired back before attacking the reporter. ""Only you would ask that,"" Biden said. ""You're a good man. You're a good man. Classy."" TENSIONS FLARE IN CONGRESS, AS GOP REP BRINGS UP HUNTER BIDEN'S COCAINE USE Campaigning late last year, Biden has also lashed out at voters -- even appearing to call one man ""fat"" for bringing up issues with his son's possible corruption and questioning his fitness for office. “You’re a damn liar, man,"" Biden said. “Let’s do push-ups together here, man. Let’s run. Let’s do whatever you want to do. Let’s take an IQ test. ... No one has said my son has done anything wrong.""

"                          Coronavirus task force member Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, joins Chris Wallace on 'Fox News Sunday.' Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Sunday that while he hopes it doesn’t come to it, the government could shut down certain sections of the country hit hard by the coronavirus. Speaking during an interview on “Fox News Sunday,” Fauci said that “anything is possible” when asked if measures like those currently being imposed in Italy could be enacted in the U.S. to help prevent the continued spread of the coronavirus.  “I don’t think it would be as draconian as nobody in or nobody out,” Fauci said. “But if we continue to get cases like this, particularly at the community level, there will be what we call 'mitigation,' where we have to essentially do social distancing, keep people out of crowded places, take a look at seriousness, do you really need to travel, and I think it’s particularly important among the most vulnerable.” He added: “You know, you don’t want to alarm people, but given the spread we’ve seen, you know, anything’s possible. And that’s the reason why we’ve got to be prepared to take whatever action is appropriate to contain and mitigate the outbreak.” CORONAVIRUS: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW Fauci’s comments shortly after Italian Minister Giuseppe Conte signed a decree restricting the movements of about a quarter of the country's population in a bid to limit contagions at the epicenter of Europe's outbreak. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo joins 'Sunday Morning Futures' to discuss the growing number of coronavirus cases in his state. “For Lombardy and for the other northern provinces that I have listed there will be a ban for everybody to move in and out of these territories and also within the same territory,"" Conte said. ""Exceptions will be allowed only for proven professional needs, exceptional cases and health issues.” Around the world, more and more countries were bracing for a big increase in virus cases. Western countries have been increasingly imitating China – where the virus first emerged late last year, and which has suffered the vast majority of infections — by imposing travel controls and shutting down public events. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Fauci also cautioned people most at risk of dying from the coronavirus or complications relating to it – the elderly and people with preexisting conditions – to keep their distance from places where they could contract the virus, and to avoid any unnecessary travel. “If you are an individual that has an underlying condition, particularly an elderly person with an underlying condition, right now you should start to distance yourself from the risk: crowds, getting on a plane, on a long plane trip, and above all, don’t get on a cruise ship,” he said. “That is a health issue.”  In waters around the world, the virus outbreak has left the cruise ship industry largely in disarray.  The Grand Princess cruise ship, where 21 people have tested positive for the virus, was heading Sunday to Oakland, Calif., after idling off San Francisco for days. It is expected to arrive Monday. Americans on the ship will be transferred to facilities around the country for testing and isolation, officials have said, but it's not yet clear what will happen to passengers from other countries. The ship had a cluster of almost 20 infections during an earlier voyage, which led to one death.  Another cruise ship has been in quarantine on the Nile River in Egypt with 45 confirmed virus cases. Malaysia and Malta turned away two other ships with no confirmed cases amid virus fears. While the global death toll has risen past 3,400, more people have now recovered from the virus than are sickened by it. As of Saturday, nearly 90,000 cases have been reported in Asia; more than 8,000 in Europe; 6,000 in the Mideast; about 450 in North America, Latin America and the Caribbean, and fewer than 50 cases reported so far in Africa. While many scientists say the world is clearly in the grips of a pandemic — a serious global outbreak – the World Health Organization isn’t calling it that yet, saying the word might spook the world further. The virus is still much less widespread than annual flu epidemics, which cause up to 5 million severe cases around the world and up to 650,000 deaths annually, according to the WHO. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is urging older adults and people with severe medical conditions to ""stay home as much as possible"" and avoid crowds.

The video was retweeted by President Trump on Saturday. The clip showed Biden in Missouri. Biden is seen addressing a crowd and the video ends with the former vice president saying, ""We can only re-elected Donald Trump."" The video got the attention of Twitter. The social media giant marked the video with a ""manipulated media"" tag, TechCrunch reported. It was the first time that the company took the step, but unveiled the policy last month.

Perhaps the most memorable one was when he was in Des Moines and talked to the Iowa Asian and Latino Coalition.

"                          366 confirmed coronavirus deaths in Italy as they implement a sweeping quarantine, 16 million people under lockdown. Amy Kellogg reports. Congress is a reactive body. It responds to events.  And here, with coronavirus, we have an “event.”  We’ve written about the late British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan in these spaces before. The story is somewhat apocryphal. But Macmillan is said to have proclaimed that “events” are the most important factor when setting the course of public policy. Macmillan wasn’t wrong.  STEVE HILTON: STOP THIS RECKLESS REACTION And that means that Congress and the Trump Administration will likely craft a series of measures to react and respond to coronavirus in the coming months. LATEST NEWS ON CORONAVIRUS The $8.3 billion measure okayed last week was mostly for health, readiness and vaccine development. Other measures will likely address everything else. The easy word to bat around is a “stimulus” measure. In the most conventional sense, a “stimulus” is an infusion of government cash to jolt the economy. President Obama and Congressional Democrats modeled their 2009 stimulus plan to bolster the economy after the “New Deal” of the 1930s. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and lawmakers authored a series of measures which changed fiscal regulations, created Social Security and launched a massive development of public works projects to respond to the Great Depression. It’s too early to completely understand the scope of coronavrius and if a “stimulus” could be required here.  But we are hearing chatter on Capitol Hill about tax cuts. More government spending. Rebates for travel. But unlike in 2009, it’s doubtful any legislation will simply be an infusion of cash centered around economic recovery. Infrastructure was a hallmark of the much-maligned 2009 stimulus plan engineered by Democrats. There are regular emanations from the Trump Administration about infrastructure. “Infrastructure week” is a running joke in Washington. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle would love to pursue an infrastructure package. Yet nothing ever happens. The Trump Administration and some Republicans on Capitol Hill spoke about “tax reform 2.0” long before coronavirus hit. But those discussions largely went nowhere. That’s partly because Democrats now control the House. There is also consternation in high tax states about how well voters received the new tax policy of a couple of years ago. There’s also a question whether Republicans really want to wade into the tax reform waters again. So let’s review what Congress did the last time it faced a fiscal crisis. In February, 2009, Congress approved what was initially billed as $787 billion economic stimulus package to shock the American economy into action after the Great Recession. The price tag of the measure eventually ballooned to $831 billion.  The Democratic House and Senate passed the plan in the first month of President Obama’s presidency. It consumed months to develop such a plan – and a new President. No Republicans in the House supported the bill. Only three GOP senators voted yea: Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Arlen Specter (R-PA). Granted, Congress responded with a $700 billion relief measure to salvage the economy in the fall of 2008 to cover losses in the financial sector. After an epic, initial failure in the House of Representatives (costing the market what was then it’s biggest point drop in a single day, in synchronicity with the bill blowing up on the House floor), Congress finally approved Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) in October, 2008. That was an immediate response because the economy teetered on the brink of collapse that autumn. But, it took a new Congress, a new President and time to assemble a full-blown stimulus package. Also, Congress and President Obama assembled a number of measures after the fiscal meltdown. There was the controversial “Dodd-Frank” financial re-regulation plan. There was also a federal rescue of the American auto industry. A contemporary package to respond to coronavirus would likely be an amalgam of tax credits for small businesses and travel, loans or even “bailouts” for damaged sectors of the economy (airlines?) and health assistance. There could also be a reduction of the “payroll tax.” If you go to the dictionary and look up the word “donnybrook,” you’ll see a picture of the internal fight waged between Congressional Republicans, over extending the payroll tax holiday in late 2011. This was a pitched, Christmastime battle royale. GOP fiscal hawks duked it out with fellow Republicans who wanted to trim taxes. And, it unfolded around the holidays because, as you know, only the zaniest worst-case scenarios unfold on Capitol Hill at Christmas.  In other words, it’s hard to have it both ways: keep taxes low yet reduce deficit spending. So what are the politics with a possible stimulus measure for coronavirus? Some Republicans are close to pushing for action – but up to a point. Those same Republicans who balked at President Obama’s stimulus plan will likely excoriate Democrats who championed the one in 2009 – and vice versa. Still, some Congressional Republicans may be tentative to call for major action, worried it would send a message of desperation and undercut President Trump. The optics of this are going to be complicated. Congressional maneuvering sends a message that lawmakers are on the case. But it can also sound alarm. At his briefing this week, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) seemed cool to cutting taxes. “I don’t know that talking about additional tax cuts now, other than for political purposes, is what we ought to be focused on,” said Hoyer. “What we ought to be focused on is what is our medical response to this.” When pressed further, Hoyer introduced an additional factor which could complicate a stimulus: Obamacare. The Maryland Democrat argued that the Trump Administration and Congressional Republicans are still trying to undo Obamacare. The Supreme Court will soon hear yet another case to overturn Obamacare. “It is ironic,” said Hoyer “That the administration says it wants to fight a major health challenge that is keeping America healthy.” Democrats are concerned that persons with “junk” health insurance plans won’t stay home from work because if they fall ill they lack adequate coverage. That could spread coronavrius. So, there could be an opportunity for Republicans to finally undercut Obamacare and replace it with something else to help respond to coronavirus.  Or…. It could mean that Republicans have to halt their attacks on Obamacare amid coronavirus and Obamacare expands far beyond its current form. Or…it could mean that coronavirus prompts a major recalibration of the American health care system.  Public opinion - and the death toll - will play heavily in all of this. If people don’t think they have sufficient health care in the coronavirus era, other options could look good. That may not mean “Medicare for All.” But it may alter the GOP’s decade-plus crusade to repeal and replace Obamacare. On Sunday night, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) took issue with the administration offering “tax breaks for major corporations” to cope with coronavirus. Pelosi and Schumer outlined a different set of proposals: Paid sick leave. Enhanced unemployment insurance. An expansion of food “security programs,” such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the food initiative for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). Protections for frontline health care workers. Widespread testing for coronavirus. Reimbursements for non-covered coronavirus-related costs. And, measures to guard against price gouging. “The administration must move more quickly and seriously to address the severe impacts of the coronavirus on the financial security of America’s families,” said Pelosi and Schumer. These are all proposals which will cost money. They will all likely require legislation. And, to become law, they have to go through President Trump. GET THE FOX NEWS APP The legislative response will take a while to sort out. Look at how long it took Congress to counter some aspects of the 2008 financial crisis. There may be immediate steps Congress takes as certain demands become evident. But the “big stuff” is likely a long way off.

Donald Trump Jr. wants to debate Hunter Biden in a bid to prove the former vice president’s son has financially benefited more than him from their fathers’ government positions. President Trump’s eldest son offered up the idea in an “Axios on HBO” interview that aired Sunday night. “You know what will be great, I’ll let you host it. You moderate a debate between Hunter Biden and myself,” he told Axios co-founder Jim Vandehei. Trump Jr. added: “We can go full transparency. We show everything, and we can talk about all of the places where I’m supposedly grifting, but Hunter Biden isn’t.” Republicans, including Trump, have repeatedly scrutinized Hunter’s lucrative position on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma while his father, Joe Biden, was vice president. “Hunter Biden, his father becomes VP. All of a sudden he goes over to Ukraine and he’s making 83 grand a month,” Trump Jr. said in the interview. Trump Jr. claimed Sunday night that, unlike Hunter, he has not profited from his father’s presidential position.

"                          366 confirmed coronavirus deaths in Italy as they implement a sweeping quarantine, 16 million people under lockdown. Amy Kellogg reports. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, issued a statement Sunday revealing that he had interacted with an attendee at last month’s Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) who had tested positive for the coronavirus -- and as a result, he'll stay at home until two weeks have passed since the encounter. Shortly afterward, Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., announced he and three additional staffers were “under self-quarantine” after “sustained contact” with a virus patient. Officials with the American Conservative Union (ACU), which hosted CPAC, said Saturday the attendee had been exposed before the conference, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed his case.       Sen. Ted Cruz R-Texas, speaks to the media during the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.      (AP) Cruz said his interaction with that individual “consisted of a brief conversation and a handshake.” “I’m not experiencing any symptoms, and I feel fine and healthy. Given that the interaction was 10 days ago, that the average incubation period is 5-6 days, that the interaction was for less than a minute, and that I have no current symptoms, the medical authorities have advised me that the odds of transmission from the other individual to me were extremely low,” Cruz said.  CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE  He added that he did not meet the CDC criteria for self-quarantine because testing was not effective before symptoms manifest.  “The medical authorities explicitly advised me that, given the above criteria, the people who have interacted with me in the 10 days since CPAC should not be concerned about potential transmission,” Cruz said.  The senator said he has decided to remain at his home in Texas until 14 days have passed since the CPAC interaction because of how frequently he interacts with his constituents and “to give everyone peace of mind.”  CONNECTICUT GOVERNOR ANNOUNCES STATE’S FIRST CORONAVIRUS CASE  “Everyone should continue to treat this outbreak seriously and be driven by facts and medical science. We need to continue to be proactive in mobilizing resources to combat this outbreak—including the $8.3 billion in emergency funding we provided last week—and I encourage everyone to follow the recommendations of the CDC and other health professionals in protecting their own health and welfare, as well as the health and welfare of those around them,” Cruz said.  Gosar later tweeted: “I am announcing that I, along with 3 of my senior staff, are officially under self-quarantine after sustained contact at CPAC with a person who has since been hospitalized with the Wuhan Virus. My office will be closed for the week.” He added, “We are all asymptomatic and feel great. But we are being proactive and cautious.” Also Sunday, ACU officials said they were working with the Maryland Department of Health since the CPAC conference was held in that state.

"                          Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders battle for the Democratic presidential nomination ahead of the Michigan primary; Fox News senior political correspondent Mike Emanuel reports. Bernie Sanders' campaign is accusing Joe Biden of pushing for a sit-down format at the March 15 presidential primary debate in Phoenix, according to a new report that highlights mounting concerns over the 77-year-old former vice president's stamina and cognitive ability. Sanders' team raised the alarm about the sit-down format during a Friday call with CNN, which is set to moderate the debate along with the Democratic National Committee (DNC), Politico reported this weekend.  All previous primary debates this cycle have required candidates to stand at podiums; and during his one-on-one debates with Hillary Clinton in 2016, Sanders stood alongside her. ""Why does Joe Biden not want to stand toe-to-toe with Sen. Sanders on the debate stage March 15 and have an opportunity to defend his record and articulate his vision for the future?"" senior Sanders advisor Jeff Weaver told the outlet. The Biden campaign denied it had anything to do with the proposed new format. Biden has stood for each of the previous debates, but the upcoming one-on-one with Sanders is expected to be a more grueling and taxing event. (Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, will be excluded from the debate under new DNC rules requiring that each candidate have received a large number of delegates.) ""We will participate in whatever debate CNN chooses to stage: standing, sitting, at podiums or in a town hall,"" Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield told Politico. ""The problem for the Sanders campaign is not the staging of the debate, but rather, the weakness of Sen. Sanders’ record and ideas."" Bedingfield added that during the joint call with CNN and the campaigns, the Biden team ""agreed to the format that CNN proposed"" -- and that after Sanders objected, the Biden ""campaign agreed to a modification of that format that CNN proposed, to compromise with both campaigns."" The nature of that modification was unclear, but the DNC has suggested the format would change to become more intimate. Sit-down-style debates are not unprecedented; in 2012, Biden sat across from then-Rep. Paul Ryan at a vice presidential debate, and in 2008, the-candidate Barack Obama debated Clinton at a roundtable. HUNTER BIDEN DEFYING COURT ORDER TO TURN OVER FINANCIAL DOCS, CONTEMPT MOTION SAYS ""After 10 debates, the DNC worked with its network partners to adapt the March debate to the smaller field of candidates and to give voters more of a voice. This format provides candidates longer response times, and for the first time, will incorporate questions from undecided voters in the audience,"" DNC spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said. Thus far, Biden's debate performances have been largely underwhelming, analysts have said. He has suggested that most Americans owned ""record players"" and could use them to connect with children, declared that half of the country has been killed by gun violence since 2007, and baffled audience members by telling them to ""go to Joe 30330."" Republicans, meanwhile, have made Biden's possible health issues a major part of their messaging, and there were signs that the attacks weren't simply political. Obama's longtime doctor, for example, has flatly remarked in an interview with The Washington Examiner that Biden was ""not a healthy guy."" ""He's not in bad shape for his age, but I wouldn't say he’s in outstanding health,"" Dr. David Scheiner said last year, after reviewing partial medical records. ""Could I guarantee he won't have issues for the next four years? He has a lot of issues that are just sort of sitting there."" On Sunday, Trump mocked Biden's gaffe-marked, seven-minute speech in St. Louis the day before. TRUMP EMBRACES MUDDLED BIDEN 'ENDORSEMENT' During the brief address, Biden declared:  ""If you want a nominee who will bring this party together, who will run a progressive, positive campaign, and turn, turn this primary from a campaign that's about negative attacks into one that's about what we're for -- because we cannot get -- re-elect -- we cannot win this re-election -- excuse me. We can only re-elect Donald Trump -- if, in fact, we get engaged in this circular firing squad here. Gotta be a positive campaign, so join us.""

Joe Biden is racking up endorsements from former rivals and Democratic insiders, but a gaffe-riddled 7-minute speech on Saturday in St. Louis, Missouri, led President Trump to tweet out an edited clip that appears to have the former vice president endorse the current commander in chief. During the brief address, Biden, 77, declared: ""If you want a nominee who will bring this party together, who will run a progressive, positive campaign, and turn, turn this primary from a campaign that's about negative attacks into one that's about what we're for -- because we cannot get -- re-elect -- we cannot win this re-election -- excuse me.

Biden also bizarrely described himself as an ""O'Biden Bama"" Democrat, transposing his name and the name of his old boss. The muddled remarks led to renewed concerns from both Republicans and left-of-center commentators that Biden may be mentally unfit for the presidency. On Twitter, President Trump jokingly took Biden's speech as a mangled endorsement. ""I agree with Joe!"" Trump wrote, captioning a video of the address that edited out the second part of Biden's remarks. The tweet was part of a larger effort by Republicans to point out what they see as one of Biden's fatal vulnerabilities, along with his son's possible corruption. Trump suggested at a Fox News Town Hall last week that Biden isn't fit for office, saying that Biden's numerous gaffes were indicative of a competency issue.

But he also said 150 million people were killed with guns, and that he was running for the U.S. Senate -- there's something going on there."" With Biden set to potentially deliver a knockout blow to Bernie Sanders during Tuesday's Michigan primary, some doctors and even some left-of-center commentators are agreeing with the president's assessment.

""Stop. Pause. He can't be president,"" Rogan said. ""Listen, we can't play any games here folks. This is a really old man who can't talk."" On Sunday, Glenn Greenwald countered accusations on social media that he was mentioning what he called Biden's ""obvious cognitive issues"" only to help Sanders, noting that he has been writing about them for months. Journalist Aaron Mate has pointed out the relative lack of scrutiny for Biden in the network media, which with some exceptions has largely steered clear of probing the former vice president's overseas dealings or his possible cognitive issues. ""When's the last time Joe Biden sat for a live, unedited interview like Bernie did this week w/ Maddow?"" Mate asked. ""For example, I'd love to know what Biden said here after claiming Hunter got his $80K/month Ukraine board gig because 'he's a really bright guy.' But it's clearly edited."" And, last summer, The New York Times reported that many Biden associates and insiders were doubting with ""significant unease"" whether he would be too old to serve as an effective candidate. Meanwhile, reports have emerged that the format for the next presidential debate will allow Biden and his opponent to sit down -- prompting the Sanders campaign to suggest Biden is getting favorable treatment. “Why does Joe Biden not want to stand toe-to-toe with Sen. Sanders on the debate stage March 15 and have an opportunity to defend his record and articulate his vision for the future?” Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ senior adviser, told Politico. For now, though, Biden is largely basking in the support of a mostly unified Democratic Party -- even picking up the endorsement of Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who just last year accused Biden of supporting what she called racist policies that affected her personally. ""There is no one better prepared than Joe to steer our nation through these turbulent times, and restore truth, honor, and decency to the Oval Office,"" Harris said in a statement Sunday. ""He is kind and endlessly caring, and he truly listens to the American people."" Harris joins Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke, ex-New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohion, former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, and former Maryland Congressman John Delaney in endorsing Biden.

Kevin McCarthy breaks down how the White House is tackling the outbreak and how Congress is planning to deal with the threat of a slowing economy. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, D-Calif., continued the Republican assault on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., for his comments last week about Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. McCarthy said that Schumer’s comments, which came as the court heard arguments in a high-profile abortion case, were meant to influence the justices’ decisions and that Democrats in the Senate should replace the New York senator as their party’s leader. “He's standing before the Supreme Court trying to influence the outcome in America,” McCarthy said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures.” “We believe we encourage the exchange of ideas not to the idea that you're going to intimidate.” McCarthy added: “If I was a Democrat in the Senate, I would have changed my leadership if this was what was happening.” MCCONNELL CALLS SCHUMER'S RESPONSE TO SUPREME COURT NOT 'MUCH OF AN APOLOGY' Schumer has taken heat following his comments at a pro-choice rally last week, where he called the case, June Medical Services LLC v. Russo, the first ""major"" abortion case since President Trump's court picks have been on the bench. The dispute, dealing with restrictions over who can perform abortions, involves a Louisiana law similar to one in Texas that the court ruled unconstitutional in 2016, before either Trump justice was on the Supreme Court and before conservatives held a 5-4 majority. ""I want to tell you, Gorsuch. I want to tell you, Kavanaugh. You have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price!"" Schumer warned. ""You won’t know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions."" Video of the remarks quickly circulated on social media, with Republicans casting the warning as a threat against two sitting Supreme Court justices. Schumer attempted to walk back his statements, claiming his words didn't come out right because of his state of mind at the time.  “I’m from Brooklyn. We speak in strong language. I shouldn’t have used the words I did, but in no way was I making a threat,” he said on the Senate floor Thursday. “I feel so deeply the anger of women all across America about Senate Republicans and the courts working hand in glove to take down Roe v. Wade."" Hours after the rally where Schumer appeared, Chief Justice John Roberts issued a statement singling out the senator's comments.  CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP “Justices know that criticism comes with the territory, but threatening statements of this sort from the highest levels of government are not only inappropriate, they are dangerous,"" Roberts said.  It was only the second time the chief justice has responded to criticism of individual judges. In 2018, Roberts rebuked Trump for the president's criticism of an ""Obama judge."" But Roberts has otherwise stayed silent, including in recent weeks when Trump questioned the impartiality of Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor, and of U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who presided over the trial and sentencing of Trump ally Roger Stone. Senate Republicans did not criticize those comments. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., himself came under criticism in August when his campaign tweeted a photo of signs that were shaped like tombstones with names of Judge Merrick Garland, President Obama's nominee to replace Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, and Democrat Amy McGrath, McConnell's likely 2020 election opponent.

The son of former vice president and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has faced accusations of corrupt behavior from both sides of the political aisle, and played a starring role in the recently concluded impeachment proceedings against President Trump. The younger Biden's distinct scandals are best understood in rough chronological order because Republicans have argued that Biden's apparently irresponsible behavior only made it more likely that his later sweetheart gigs were obtained not through merit, but because of connections that he could monetize. In 2008, both The New York Times and The American Spectator highlighted Hunter Biden's sweetheart gigs while his father rose in political prominence. The articles, written as Barack Obama and John McCain vied for the White House, found that Hunter Biden received consulting fees from the financial services company MBNA from 2001 to 2005 — while his father, then a senator, was pushing successfully for legislation that would make it harder for consumers to file for bankruptcy protection. The precise amount of the payments was unclear, but a company official once said Hunter Biden was receiving at least a $100,000 per year retainer, the Times reported. Hunter Biden, now 49, previously had been an executive at MBNA beginning in 1996, but the consulting fees came years after his departure from the company as a full-time employee. Aides to then-presidential candidate Barack Obama at the time denied that any lobbying had occurred, and insisted the payments were proper. However, that explanation was immediately treated with skepticism. The Trump campaign recently posted a contemporaneous interview in which an incredulous Tom Brokaw asked Joe Biden whether it was ""inappropriate"" for the then-senator to have his son ""collecting money from this big credit card company while you were on the [Senate] floor protecting its interests."" Hunter Biden's previous work as an executive at MBNA from 1996 to 1998 also has raised what critics called red flags. Rachel Mullen, a former senior personal banking officer at MBNA from 1994-2001 who later went into Republican politics, tweeted that managers referred to the younger Biden as ""Senator MBNA"" after he was hired into a lucrative management-prep track right after he graduated from Yale Law School. An MBNA source who previously worked at the company told Fox News that other employees heard Hunter Biden boasting that his salary was unusually high, even for the management-prep track — which was widely seen in the company as a way to groom and pamper well-connected executive candidates with powerful family members.

(AP Photo/Elise Amendola)       The source said Biden's ""Senator MBNA"" nickname was not politically motivated, but rather reflected a widely held belief among managers – who did not work directly with Biden – that he essentially was engaged in lobbying. The Bidens' connections with MBNA apparently ran deep. In a January 2008 article entitled ""The Senator from MBNA,"" columnist Byron York recounted how then-MBNA vice chairman John Cochran paid ""top dollar"" for Joe Biden's home in February 1996, just prior to his Senate reelection bid, and that ""MBNA gave Cochran a lot of money – $330,000– to help with 'expenses' related to the move."" The $1.2M sale was a ""pretty darned good deal for Biden,"" York wrote, noting that ""Cochran simply paid Biden’s full asking price"" even though the ""house needed quite a bit of work; contractors and their trucks descended on the house for months after the purchase."" Asked how Cochran and Biden found each other for the sale, an MBNA spokesperson told York: ""That’s a very personal question."" Aside from MBNA during this period, the younger Biden worked at a lobbying firm and served on the board of Amtrak -- a prestigious role he apparently obtained through his connections, although Democrats claimed he deserved the post because he traveled regularly on trains. ""Hunter Biden has spent a lot of time on Amtrak trains. Like his father, like our congressman, Mike Castle, and myself, Hunter Biden has lived in Delaware while using Amtrak to commute to his job as we commute to our job in Washington almost every day of the week,"" Democratic Delaware Sen. Tom Carper said at a hearing on Biden's nomination to the Amtrak board in June 2006. ""You know, you learn a lot about what could work and what would work better at Amtrak by riding trains and talking to the passengers, the commuters, the passengers, the folks who work on the trains and make them work every day."" In 2014, Hunter was kicked out of the military after testing positive for cocaine. The Navy said that Biden, a former lobbyist who worked at a private equity firm, was discharged barely a year after he was selected for his part-time position as a public affairs officer in the Navy Reserve. Two people familiar with the situation quickly told the media that Biden was discharged because he failed a drug test in 2013. The Wall Street Journal first reported Biden’s discharge and failed drug test. TREASURY COMPLIES WITH HUNTER BIDEN INQUIRY, HANDS OVER SENSITIVE DOCS An attorney by training, Biden applied to join the Navy Reserve as a public affairs officer and was selected in 2012 — one of seven candidates recommended for a direct commission for public affairs. A board of senior Navy officers interviewed Biden before making the recommendation.       Photo exclusively obtained by Fox News shows Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, and Devon Archer golfing. The elder Biden has denied discussing his overseas business dealings with his son.       Because he was 42 at the time, he needed a special waiver to be accepted. Cmdr. Ryan Perry, a spokesman for the Navy, said Biden had been assigned to the Navy Public Affairs Support Element East, based in Norfolk, Va. Hunter Biden and and his friend Devon Archer joined the natural gas company Burisma Holdings board in April 2014. Biden apparently cannot speak Ukrainian and had no relevant natural gas experience. Joe Biden has acknowledged on camera that in spring 2016, when he was vice president and spearheading the Obama administration's Ukraine policy, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire top prosecutor Viktor Shokin. At the time, Shokin was investigating the notoriously corrupt Burisma Holdings — where Hunter's role was especially lucrative. The vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion in critical U.S. aid if Shokin was not fired. ""Well, son of a b---h, he got fired,"" Biden joked at a panel two years after leaving office. Shokin himself had already been widely accused of corruption. WHOOPS: BIDEN CAMPAIGN TOUTS UKRAINE ACTIVIST WHO CALLED HUNTER'S ACTIONS 'VERY BAD' Critics alleged Hunter Biden might have been selling access to his father, who had pushed Ukraine to increase its natural gas production. Government officials have raised similar concerns. During the House impeachment proceedings, a career State Department employee testified that he had flagged Hunter Biden's apparent conflict of interest, but was told essentially not to bother the vice president's office. ""Impossible to justify $50k/month for Hunter Biden serving on a Ukrainian energy board w zero expertise unless he promised to sell access,"" political scientist Ian Bremmer previously tweeted. Joe Biden has said he never discussed his son's overseas business dealings -- an assertion seemingly contradicted by both his son and a photo exclusively obtained by Fox News. “I know I did nothing wrong at all. Was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is a swamp in many ways? Yeah,"" Hunter Biden said in an exclusive sit-down with ABC's Amy Robach at his Los Angeles home last October. TENSIONS FLARE IN CONGRESS, AS GOP REP BRINGS UP HUNTER BIDEN'S COCAINE USE He acknowledged he may not have gotten the job were it not for his connections to the vice presidency. In the ABC News report last year which also delved into the Bidens' China dealings, journalist Tom Llamas called it ""strange"" that Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings, widely accused of corruption, had appointed Hunter Biden to its board of directors -- and agreed to pay Hunter Biden's company ""more than a million dollars a year."" ""Hunter -- a lawyer, who had just been discharged from the Navy Reserves for testing positive for cocaine,"" Llamas says incredulously. ""He had served on other boards, but had no known experience in Ukraine or natural gas."" Earlier this month, the Treasury Department complied with a Senate inquiry into the younger Biden's business dealings in Ukraine and reportedly handed over highly sensitive financial records and ""evidence of questionable origin."" Top Republican senators recently requested travel records from the Secret Service that might shed light on Hunter Biden's dealings in China, which Trump has long said merit a state investigation. Much of the focus concerns Biden's position as one of nine directors at BHR -- a private-equity company controlled by Chinese government-backed stakeholders. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said the arrangement raised red flags.

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File)       ""In December of 2013, one month after Rosemont Seneca's joint venture with Bohai Capital to form BHR, Hunter Biden reportedly flew aboard Air Force Two with then-Vice President Biden to China,"" the senators wrote. ""While in China, he helped arrange for Jonathan Li, CEO of Bohai Capital, to 'shake hands' with Vice President Biden."" ""Afterward,"" they continued, ""Hunter Biden met with Li for reportedly a 'social meeting.' After the China trip, BHR's business license was approved. Then, in 2015, BHR joined with Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) to acquire Henniges, which was the 'biggest Chinese investment into U.S. automotive manufacturing assets to date.'"" The senators also sought travel records relating to Biden's trips to Ukraine, if any. Last year, Biden stepped down from the board of BHR and said he wouldn't take similar roles if his father won the presidency. The Wall Street Journal reported that BHR Partners filings show that while Hunter was a director of BHR since its founding, he didn't become a shareholder until October 2017. Trump has specifically accused Biden of walking ""out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund.” The Journal reported in 2014 that BHR was trying to raise that much money to invest outside of China, but it's otherwise unclear what the president was referencing. In January of this year Hunter Biden agreed to pay monthly child support retroactive to November 2018, temporarily ending a standoff that began after the judge in his Arkansas paternity case ordered him to appear in person for a hearing to explain why he shouldn't be held in contempt. But, the standoff reignited in March, when Biden apparently failed to meet a court deadline to turn over additional financial documents. Republicans suggested he was hiding evidence of corruption. The matter remains pending. Biden had previously denied paternity, before a DNA test proved otherwise. HUNTER BIDEN FINALLY AGREES TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT FOR KID FATHERED WITH EX-STRIPPER The court redacted the amount of child support that Biden agreed to pay, pursuant to his agreement with plaintiff Lunden Alexis Roberts, who alleged Biden was an entirely absent father. However, Independence County Circuit Court Judge Holly Meyer noted that she ""lacks sufficient information"" to determine the appropriate amount of ""permanent"" child support ""based off the defendant's income,"" and that modifications to the child support owed each month could be made based on additional evidence. Contempt proceedings over Biden's repeated failure to turn over relevant financial documents were only delayed until March 1, and Biden apparently has not resolved the issue. ""After months of hiding, one has to wonder if the reason Hunter Biden continues to defy the court is because there are financial documents could shed light on his father’s massive conflicts of interest as vice president,"" Republican National Committee (RNC) spokesman Steve Guest told Fox News. READ THE ORDER REQUIRING BIDEN TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT The paternity dispute has presented headaches for the elder Biden ever since a court filing showed that DNA results indicated he was now a grandfather. Joe Biden tangled with a Fox News reporter on camera when asked about that development last November. ""No one has said my son has done anything wrong."" ""I'm wondering if you have a comment on this report, and court filing, out of Arkansas, that your son Hunter just made you a grandfather again,"" Fox News’ Peter Doocy asked. ""No, that’s a private matter and I have no comment,"" Biden fired back before attacking the reporter. ""Only you would ask that,"" Biden said. ""You're a good man. You're a good man. Classy."" Campaigning late last year, Biden has also lashed out at voters -- even appearing to call one man ""fat"" for bringing up issues with his son's possible corruption and questioning his fitness for office. “You’re a damn liar, man,"" Biden said. “Let’s do push-ups together here, man. Let’s run. Let’s do whatever you want to do. Let’s take an IQ test. ... No one has said my son has done anything wrong."" The Associated Press contributed to this report.

"                          Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders joins moderators Martha MacCallum and Bret Baier for a Fox News town hall in Dearborn, Michigan. As his struggling campaign seeks a big win in Michigan's Tuesday primary, Bernie Sanders took the stage at a Fox News Town Hall in Detroit and wasted little time in dismissing front-runner Joe Biden as a friend to ""crooks"" -- and former rival Hillary Clinton as a seemingly bitter ex-candidate stuck in the past. ""I always give this guy a hard time,"" Sanders joked at the outset, referring to Fox News Channel anchor Bret Baier, who was hosting the town hall alongside Martha MacCallum. ""This is going to be fun tonight,"" Baier responded. Within minutes, Sanders took aim at the former vice president, saying Biden had ""bailed out the crooks on Wall Street who nearly destroyed our economy 12 years ago."" That $700 billion rescue plan also had the support of then-presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain. Questioned about Biden's recent verbal gaffes and his broader competence, Sanders remarked, ""I'm not here to criticize Joe, but to say that I think the American people at this incredibly complicated and difficult moment in our history, are entitled to thoughtful answers to the crises we face.""       Fox News Channel anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum question Sanders at the Fox News Town Hall on Monday in Detroit, Mich.       ""I'm not gonna go to that level -- that's for people to decide,"" Sanders added, when Baier presented video of Democrats criticizing the former vice president's mental fitness for elected office. ""I’m not going to be making personal attacks on Joe."" The Biden campaign has repeatedly refused Fox News Channel's invitations to participate in a town hall. Separately, prompted by a recent video clip of Clinton claiming that ""nobody likes"" Sanders and that he ""didn't work until he was 41,"" Sanders responded: ""Unlike Secretary Clinton, I don't want to relive 2016. We're in 2020 now."" ""But, what I would say on a good day, is my wife likes me,"" Sanders said to applause. ""But also, if you guys look at some of the polling they do for United States senators, in most cases I turn out to be the most popular senator in the country."" (At the end of the town hall, in response to a question as to who his closest friend is in Washington, Sanders said, ""My wife."") Later, seeking to assure a voter from Russia that his brand of ""democratic socialism"" would not bring widespread poverty and despair to the United States, Sanders said he instead wanted a country more like Denmark, Finland and Sweden. ""What happened in the Soviet Union was not socialism, it was authoritarian communism,"" Sanders said as attendees cheered. ""I'm not an expert on the current economy in Sweden,"" Sanders responded when MacCallum noted Sweden was pushing towards more deregulation and less taxes, and that the population in the U.S. is much larger than that of the Nordic countries. ""They have gone a long way to eliminate poverty, to make sure that all of their people have the basic needs that they need to live good lives."" Sanders said studies have shown that countries like Denmark are among the ""happiest on earth,"" because they provide various free services like college and health care. Other studies, however, have showed that Denmark essentially free-rides heavily from U.S. capitalism, and argue that mimicking their welfare programs may backfire. Sanders also slammed President Trump's response to the coronavirus outbreak -- and said that he would not consider closing the border, no matter what. ""If you had to, would you close down the borders?"" Baier asked, referring to efforts to stop the spread of coronavirus. ""No,"" Sanders replied flatly. He went on to condemn xenophobia and suggest that scientists would need to outline the appropriate approach. Sanders also hit Trump's appointment of Vice President Mike Pence to lead the coronavirus task force and inaccurately claimed that Trump had advised Americans with the virus to head to work. In fact, Trump told Fox News ""Hannity"" that, empirically, some Americans are going to work with the virus and recovering without incident. ""Sadly, we have an administration in Washington that has shown the world that it does not believe in science,"" Sanders said, taking aim at the White House on issues from climate change to health care. ""When you appoint Vice President Pence, an individual who also doesn't much believe in science, what you're telling the whole world is that you're politicizing this issue."" ""I'm not an expert on the current economy in Sweden."" Baier pressed Sanders on the coronavirus response, saying that Trump has in fact appointed numerous experts to address the issue. Sanders responded by mocking Trump's claim to have a ""natural ability"" to address disasters. ""You listen to the scientists; you don't say stupid things,"" Sanders said. ""You don't suggest to people they can go to work."" Sanders returned to his talking points about the wealthiest people not paying their ""fair share"" in taxes, leading MacCallum to probe whether Sanders would reconsider his policies given the ongoing stock market crisis. SANDERS RELEASES DETAILS ON HOW HE'D PAY FOR MAJOR PROPOSALS -- ARE THERE ISSUES? ""I will not become president until January, and the economic situation will be different then,"" Sanders said. As to what he would do if he were president today, Sanders said an ""economic stimulus"" could come in the form of ""invest[ing] in working-class people in good-paying jobs by rebuiling our crumbling infrastructure -- roads, bridges."" He added that ""I'm not here to demonize anybody,"" after MacCallum pointed out that Bill Gates is contributing substantially to coronavirus efforts. At the same time, Sanders said, it was absurd to depend upon the ""generosity"" of billionaires. Then, in a dramatic call-and-response moment with the audience at the town hall, Sanders established that Canada is not a socialist or communist system of government and yet manages to provide government-run health care at a minimal cost to patients. The president, for his part, has derided Canada's health-care system and pointed out that even Canadians complain about their long waiting times, relatively substandard care, and high taxes. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders joins moderators Martha MacCallum and Bret Baier for a Fox News town hall in Dearborn, Michigan. The Vermont senator acknowledged that taxes would go up by 4 percent at a minimum to incomes over $29,000, in additional to more payroll taxes on employers and stock market transaction taxes, but asserted that ""comprehensive"" health care is worth it. Sanders said he wanted a ""modest"" tax on ""Wall Street speculation."" The proposal, according to Sanders' campaign, specifically would place a ""0.5 percent tax on stock trades – 50 cents on every $100 of stock – a 0.1 percent fee on bond trades, and a 0.005 percent fee on derivative trades."" Sanders' campaign has claimed that a ""modest tax on Wall Street speculation ... will raise an estimated $2.4 trillion over ten years"" and, in one fell swoop, make all ""public colleges, universities and trade schools tuition-free ... and cancel all student debt over the next decade."" However, the National Review has likened a tax on so-called ""Wall Street speculation"" to a de facto tax on savings, and asserted the Sanders plan is untested and ""would mean paying $25 to the federal government every time you traded $5,000 worth of stock — or five times what you’d pay the typical online brokerage in fees. ... Over the long term, that imposes serious costs on actively traded funds such as the ones containing many Americans’ retirement funds.""       Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rev. Jesse Jackson wave to the crowd at a rally for Sanders at Calder Plaza in Grand Rapids, Michigan on Sunday, March 8, 2020. Michigan's presidential primary is Tuesday. (Anntaninna Biondo/The Grand Rapids Press via AP)       At the town hall, Sanders alluded to a disputed Yale University study to argue that ""Medicare-for-all"" would save money largely by cutting down on administrative costs. Other nonpartisan estimates have put the cost of Sanders' ""Medicare-for-all"" proposal at over $32 trillion. Baier and MacCallum moderated Sanders’ second Fox News Town Hall of the election cycle. At last April's event, a combative Sanders made no apologizes for his wealth, and acknowledged that his plans would lead to tax hikes for many Americans. Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington will also hold primaries on Tuesday, and a combined 352 delegates will be at stake. Michigan's 125 pledged delegates are perhaps the day's biggest prize and offer Sanders an opportunity to cut down front-runner Joe Biden's current 91-delegate lead. SANDERS HIRES ADVISOR WHO BLAMED AMERICA FOR 9/11 Sanders won the Michigan primary over Hillary Clinton in 2016 after taking a beating on Super Tuesday, but this year, surveys show him down by as many as two-dozen points. Biden tops Sanders 51 percent to 36 percent among likely Democratic presidential primary voters in Michigan, a Monmouth University survey released on Monday showed. An outstanding question going into Tuesday is whether Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who dropped out of the race last week, will endorse Biden or Sanders. So far, she's declined to back either, an especially frustrating development for Sanders, who could use Warren's help in unifying progressives in much the same way Biden has been able to rally moderates. Sanders tells Fox News he wouldn't close US borders during coronavirus-type contagion Sanders has scoffed at suggestions he could drop out if he doesn't win Michigan, but his travel schedule underscores its importance. He canceled a trip to Mississippi and instead made five campaign stops across Michigan since Friday. And he was holding a roundtable in Detroit on Monday with health experts to discuss the spread of the new coronavirus. Sanders has accused Biden of relying on billionaires to finance his campaign but also says he's now running against “the Democratic establishment.” The senator told Fox News on Sunday that he'd win Michigan and repeated that at a rally in Grand Rapids, but he added the major caveat for supporters that he'd only pull it off “if we stick together, we bring our friends out to vote.” FLASHBACK: AT TESTY FNC TOWN HALL, SANDERS MAKES NO APOLOGIES FOR MAKING MILLIONS Sanders won't say if he's personally lobbying Warren for her endorsement. He did manage to secure the backing of Jesse Jackson, who said it was no time for centrist compromise. “With the exception of Native Americans, African-Americans are the people who are most behind socially and economically in the United States and our needs are not moderate,"" Jackson said at Sanders' Grand Rapids rally. “A people far behind cannot catch up choosing the most moderate path.” Still, one of Sanders' highest-profile supporters, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, struck a far more conciliatory tone addressing 10,000-plus on the campus of the University of Michigan on Sunday night, saying, “In order for us to win, we have to grow.”       President Donald Trump gestures while walking on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington on Monday after stepping off Marine One. A “Women for Trump” bus tour has been canceled, the president’s campaign said, citing scheduling conflicts. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)       “We must be inclusive. We must bring more people into this movement,"" she said, urging Sanders supporters to shed “cynicism and exclusion” and “turn with an embracing posture, where all people are welcome in a people's movement.” Sanders is hoping to do well in Washington state on Tuesday, but could face hurdles in Mississippi and Missouri. Sanders' team acknowledges he will also struggle in next week's Florida primary, where the senator's past defense of Fidel Castro looms large. He also could face long odds in Ohio and Illinois — especially if he underperforms in Michigan. Both of those states also vote March 17. The wild card next week could be Arizona, where Sanders will be counting on strong Latino support, which lifted him to victory in California. MARCH 10 PRIMARY PRIMER: THE STATES AND THE STAKES The intricate arithmetic of how delegates are won makes it possible Tuesday for a winning candidate to reap a bigger haul of delegates with a smaller margin of victory than any other night. This gives Biden an opportunity to greatly increase his lead over Sanders or for Sanders to close the gap. Delegates are mostly awarded proportionally in congressional districts. And nearly two-thirds of Tuesday districts have an odd number of delegates up for grabs. When there is an odd number of delegates available, that means one of the two candidates will get more delegates. In districts with an even number of delegates, proportional distribution means that in close races, both candidates get the same number of delegates and that makes it more difficult for Sanders to catch Biden. After March 17, most delegates are in districts with an even number of delegates. Monday's Sanders Fox News Town Hall was the eleventh town hall of the current election season hosted by Fox News and the tenth with a Democratic presidential candidate. FNC’s first town hall with Sanders held the record for the most-watched town hall of the 2020 election cycle with nearly 2.6 million viewers, before Trump's town hall dethroned it with a whopping 4.2 million viewers. Recent Fox News town halls were held with then-Democratic presidential candidates Mike Bloomberg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, both co-moderated by Baier and MacCallum, as well as former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, moderated by Chris Wallace.

"                          'Dr. Oz Show' host Dr. Mehmet Oz joins Harris Faulkner to discuss the coronavirus outbreak on 'Outnumbered Overtime.' Two more Republican lawmakers -- GOP Reps. Doug Collins of Georgia and Matt Gaetz of Florida -- revealed Monday they had contact with the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) attendee who has since been diagnosed with coronavirus, saying they are not experiencing symptoms but will self-quarantine out of an abundance of caution. Both Collins and Gaetz are pro-Trump Republicans who have been with President Trump since CPAC: Collins shook Trump's hand and joined him for a visit to the CDC in Atlanta on Friday. He also met with Trump at the White House last Tuesday, several days after the Feb. 26-29 conference.       President Donald Trump greets Rep.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)       That makes four Republican lawmakers who have said they interacted with the CPAC attendee who tested positive for COVID-19, after announcements over the last day from Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar. Cruz's office released an update on the senator, saying he feels fine: ""Sen. Cruz feels great, has not exhibited any symptoms of the coronavirus in the last 11 days, and is not currently experiencing any symptoms."" CPAC ATTENDEE INTERACTED WITH 'SEVERAL' MEMBERS OF CONGRESS: CAPITOL PHYSICIAN Collins said Monday it was a photograph that led CPAC to determine his interaction with the sick attendee. “This afternoon, I was notified by CPAC that they discovered a photo of myself and the patient who has tested positive for coronavirus,” Collins said in a statement Monday. “While I feel completely healthy and I am not experiencing any symptoms, I have decided to self-quarantine at my home for the remainder of the 14-day period out of an abundance of caution.” He added: “I will follow the recommendations of the House Physician and my office will provide updates as appropriate.” Gaetz's office said he planned to close his Washington office as he awaited test results. ""Congressman Gaetz was informed today that he came into contact with a CPAC attendee 11 days ago who tested positive for COVID-19,"" read a tweet from the congressman's account, adding that ""while the Congressman is not experiencing symptoms, he received testing today and expects results soon."" ""Under doctor's usual precautionary recommendations, he'll remain self-quarantined until the 14-day period expires this week,"" Gaetz's account said. The attending physician for the U.S. Capitol acknowledged Monday that the patient had contact with “several” members of Congress at CPAC. In a statement Monday, Dr. Brian Monahan said that the individual who has been diagnosed with coronavirus was “able to recall specific names of people he had contact with during the meeting.” TRUMP DOWNPLAYS CORONAVIRUS THREAT, NOTES 'COMMON FLU' KILLS THOUSANDS EVERY YEAR Three senior members of Gosar’s staff are also self-quarantined, the lawmaker said. Last week, Gaetz got attention for wearing a gas mask on the House floor and in the Capitol building. The White House was made aware of the CPAC attendee’s diagnosis, as both Trump and Vice President Pence attended and spoke at the conference which took place from Feb. 26 to 29. The White House said there is no indication that Trump or Pence was in close proximity to the stricken attendee. Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, which puts on CPAC, said he had a brief and “incidental contact” with the patient. He is also self-quarantined at this time, despite feeling no symptoms. Despite not having contact with the individual, Trump did come into contact with Schlapp. Meanwhile, Trump downplayed the threat of coronavirus on Monday, noting that the “common flu” kills thousands of Americans each year and that “life & the economy go on.” “So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year,” Trump tweeted Monday. ""Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus with 22 deaths. Think about that!” According to the CDC, during the 2018-2019 flu season in the U.S., an estimated 35.5 million people were sick with influenza and approximately 34,200 people died from the illness.

Trump said that he plans to meet with Senate leadership on Wednesday to discuss a payroll tax cut, small business aid and help for hourly workers who might become sick. “They’ll be very dramatic,” Trump said of the proposed economic measures during an evening briefing at the White House. “This blindsided the world and I think we handled it very well.” Trump told reporters that the administration was seeking “very substantial relief."" Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow were expected to make the request of Senate Republicans on Tuesday afternoon. The markets appeared to react positively to Trump's announcement, with futures on all three major indices surging by more than two percent. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE The president, who was joined in the White House briefing room by Vice President Mike Pence and the rest of the coronavirus task force, praised his administration’s work in combatting the virus – including prohibiting entry into the U.S. from certain countries and coordinating with state governors – and reiterated that the spread of the virus was not caused by mismanagement within Washington. “This is not our country’s fault, this was something that was thrown at us,” Trump said. “The main thing is we’re taking care of the American public.” Before his press conference, Trump met Mnuchin, Kudlow and other aides about a range of economic actions he could take. He also invited Wall Street executives to the White House on Wednesday to discuss the economic fallout of the epidemic. Kudlow told reporters Friday that the administration is not looking at a “massive” federal relief plan. Rather, any federal aid package would be “timely and targeted and micro.” Lawmakers on Capitol Hill had barely started to contemplate the economic implications of the spread of the virus and what might be needed to stimulate the economy as people cancel vacations and business trips and stay away from stores. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, told reporters that “everything’s on the table."" But members of the Senate Republican leadership, including Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, played down the need for an economic stimulus package of any kind, be it tax cuts or aid for workers. “It’s premature to be talking about that,” Cornyn told reporters. “I usually love tax cuts but I think it’s a little premature.” CORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN Democrats have indicated they preferred other responses, like passing legislation requiring employers to give their workers paid sick leave — a longtime policy priority of Democrats — and additional help for those with lower incomes. Pence, who is heading the task force combatting the outbreak of coronavirus, noted once again that the chances of Americans contracting the virus remain low – and of becoming seriously ill even lower – but warned that the precautions outlined by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) should still be followed. While intent on projecting calm, Trump earlier in the day lashed out about the plunging stock market and convened a meeting of his top economic advisers to address what to do about it. Meanwhile, the number of Republican lawmakers who announced they were isolating themselves because of possible exposure to the virus grew to five. As Trump grappled with an epidemic whose consequences he has repeatedly played down, the White House asserted it was conducting “business as usual.” But the day's business was anything but normal. Lawmakers pressed for details on how the Capitol could be made secure, a Pentagon meeting was broken into sub-groups to minimize the number of people in the same room and the Army commander in Europe placed himself in a precautionary quarantine. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The president dove into handshakes with supporters Monday morning when arriving to headline a fundraiser in Longwood, Fla., that raised approximately $4 million for his reelection campaign and the Republican Party. He ignored shouted questions about the sinking stock market as he boarded Air Force One for the flight back to Washington. On that flight was Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who later went into a voluntary quarantine. He was one of several GOP lawmakers who were exposed to a person at last month's Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) who later tested positive for the virus. Trump did not respond to shouted questions by reporters if he had been tested for the coronavirus following his flight with Gaetz. Pence said he did not know if the president had been tested but told reporters he had not himself received a test for the virus. Late Monday evening, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham issued a statement saying that Trump had not received testing for coronavirus because ""he has neither had prolonged close contact with any known confirmed COVID-19 patients, nor does he have any symptoms"" ""President Trump remains in excellent health, and his physician will continue to closely monitor him,"" Grisham said. On Monday, Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., and Gaetz put themselves in voluntary quarantine because of their contacts with the infected person at CPAC. Both said they did not have any symptoms but would wait out the remainder of the 14 days since the contact at home. Gaetz last week wore a gas mask to the House vote on the emergency funding bill for the virus response and said he wanted to highlight how Congress could become a “petri dish” for the virus. Collins met Trump on Tuesday night at the White House and shook hands with him Friday when the president visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Atlanta headquarters. “The president of the United States, as we all know, is quite a hand-washer,"" press secretary Stephanie Grisham told Fox News earlier Monday. ""He uses hand sanitizer all the time. So he's not concerned about this at all.” The Associated Press contributed to this report.

The U.S.-Taliban deal signed on Feb. 29 was touted as Washington’s effort to end 18 years of war in Afghanistan.

"                          Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders joins moderators Martha MacCallum and Bret Baier for a Fox News town hall in Dearborn, Michigan. Underscoring what’s at stake for his White House bid when Michigan and five other states hold Democratic presidential nomination contests on Tuesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders emphasizes that “this is a very, very important day in Michigan.” Speaking in front of more than 10,000 people at a rally at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, the populist senator from Vermont on Sunday spotlighted that Michigan’s “the most important state” to hold a contest on March 10, which is being dubbed ‘mini Super Tuesday’ or ‘Super Tuesday 2.0.’       Democratic presidential candidate U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., speaks during a campaign rally at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Mich., Sunday, March 8, 2020. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya)       MARCH 10 PRIMARY PRIMER: THE STATES AND THE STAKES With 125 pledged delegates at stake, Michigan is the biggest prize among the six states holding contests on Tuesday. The others are Missouri, Mississippi, Washington state, Idaho and North Dakota. Sanders, a populist senator who’s making his second-straight presidential run, defeated eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016's primary in Michigan, in what was considered a major upset victory. That foreshadowed Clinton’s narrow loss to Donald Trump in the November 2016 general election in Michigan. Trump’s victory with working-class white voters in the state, as well as similar narrow wins in two other crucial Rust Belt states – Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – propelled him to the White House. The pre-Michigan primary polls in 2016 got it all wrong – as they indicated Clinton with a double-digit lead over Sanders. “The 2016 Michigan Democratic primary is considered to be the biggest polling miss of that cycle. Polls released in the week before the state primary showed Hillary Clinton with anywhere from a 10 to 27 point lead,"" noted Monmouth University pollster Patrick Murray. Fast forward four years and former Vice President Joe Biden’s now the clear front-runner in Michigan with the final polls released on primary eve indicating the former vice president with a double-digit lead over Sanders. But Sanders is holding out hope for a repeat performance that would stave off elimination and instead boost the senator back into a massive battle with Biden for the nomination. An optimistic Sanders predicted on Fox News Sunday “I think we're gonna do well on Tuesday, and we're gonna beat Biden.”  While a loss would be considered a setback, Sanders doesn’t see such a prospect as fatal. “I certainly would not consider dropping out,” he stressed. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 20S0 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN  Sanders was the front-runner for the Democratic nomination after winning the Feb. 11 New Hampshire primary and then shellacking the field a week and a half later at the Nevada caucuses. But thanks to his landslide victory in South Carolina a week and a half ago – and a strong performance during last week’s Super Tuesday when he swept 10 of the 14 states holding primaries on Super Tuesday and took the lead over Sanders in the all-important race for Democratic nomination convention delegates – Biden’s moved closer to locking up the nomination. Because of its general election political symbolism and the large delegate cache, Michigan’s capturing the lion’s share of media attention among this week’s round of contests. Biden - very cognizant of the polling debacle in 2016 – stressed on Monday that “I’m kind of superstitious, I see all these polls...I remember Hillary was up by 23 points...I don’t take anything for granted.” Biden, with an eye on November’s general election, emphasized during a rally Monday in Flint that “Michigan is an important contest not just for the Democratic primary, because the outcome of Michigan in November may determine who the next person United States is going to be.” The former vice president’s enjoyed a tidal wave of endorsements from current and former members of Congress and governors the past 10 days - as the party establishment and other moderates all coalesced around Biden to prevent Sanders – a self-described democratic socialist – from becoming the party’s standard-bearer in November’s general election. And many of his former rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination have endorsed his White House bid. Two of those one-time rivals – Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California – joined Biden on the campaign trail in Michigan on Monday after backing him just in the past 24 hours. Sanders, fighting for survival, has increased his jabs at Biden in the wake of Super Tuesday. At a Fox News town hall on primary eve in Detroit, Sanders charged that Biden had ""bailed out the crooks on Wall Street who nearly destroyed our economy 12 years ago."" But he failed to mention that $700 billion rescue plan also had the support of then-presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain. A day earlier in Ann Arbor, Sanders slammed the former vice president  - saying “here we are a few days before a major primary here in Michigan. And we are taking on, in this campaign, not just Joe Biden….We're taking on the 60 billionaires who are funding his campaign. Biden, in a much more comfortable position, has refrained from blasting Sanders. Instead, on Monday he gently jabbed his rival, saying “we’re not looking for a revolution.” The push for a political revolution has long been a staple of Sanders stump speech. But the former vice president’s aiming for what he hopes will a be a near knockout punch to Sanders. Democratic strategist Michael Ceraso – a veteran of the 2016 Sanders campaign and the 2020 White House bid by former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg – stressed that a Biden victory in Michigan coupled with likely wins in Missouri and Mississippi will “put a huge hurdle in front of Sanders to get the delegates he needs to win.”    ",         Sanders fights for another rust belt upset to regain momentum against Biden,         2020-03-09T231941-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/sanders-fights-for-another-rust-belt-upset-to-regain-momentum-against-biden,Fox

Aides on Capitol Hill are anxious over what they consider to be a muddled response from both their bosses and the White House to the coronavirus outbreak. Lawmakers in both chambers have been fielding questions from members and staff about how Capitol Hill will be secured, but congressional leaders have so far shown little willingness to close the Capitol building, despite meetings being scheduled throughout the day to discuss preparations. “The chiefs of staff are in a panic,” one longtime aide told Fox News when speaking about coronavirus.  CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE The hesitancy to close Congress could be due in part to fears of how it would affect the already shaky stock market, which plunged to its lowest point since the 2008 financial crisis on Monday.  If Congress were to close up in the midst of the virus outbreak, a number of issues would need to be dealt with, including finding thousands of laptops for aides and members to use when working from home. Fox News is told that congressional work must be performed on congressionally issued computers or devices. The question of how Congress will operate also comes as a number of lawmakers have self-quarantined themselves after being in contact with someone exposed to the virus.  On Sunday, two members of Congress, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., said they are isolating themselves after determining they had contact with the person at the Conservative Political Action Conference nearly two weeks ago. Cruz said Sunday he had brief contact with the man and would spend the next few days at his home in Texas until a full 14 days had passed since their interaction. Gosar said that he had also made contact with the man at CPAC and that he and three members of his senior staff were under self-quarantine. His office will be closed for the week, he said in a tweet Sunday. President Trump also attended the CPAC conference. Besides Cruz and Gosar, the CPAC schedule listed three other senators and 12 House members as speakers. They included House Minority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, House Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney of Wyoming and congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina, who has since become the White House chief of staff. Also on the schedule was Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. A spokesman for Cheney said she has been told by CPAC that she was not exposed to the convention attendee who has tested positive for the coronavirus.

"                          Jenny Beth Martin, chairman of the Tea Party Patriots, and Democratic strategist Mustafa Tameez joins the debate. EXCLUSIVE: The Trump campaign has sent a scathing letter to Twitter's leadership after the platform took the unprecedented step of labeling one of its videos ""manipulated media,"" saying that under the social media giant's new standard, Joe Biden's team has uploaded its own ""doctored and deceptively edited"" video as recently as last week. “The Biden campaign is scared as hell that voters will see the flood of unedited and embarrassing verbal stumbles that will continue go viral if ‘Status Quo Joe’ is the nominee,"" Trump campaign rapid response director Andrew Clark told Fox News. ""Twitter shouldn’t be an enforcement arm of Joe Biden’s campaign strategy, but if they choose to police every video clip they must hold his own campaign to the same standard.” The confrontation began this the weekend when Trump communications director Dan Scavino tweeted an edited version of a Biden speech in which the former vice president appears to deliver a muddled and inadvertent endorsement of Trump. Scavino's clip, which the president later reposted, did not alter any of Biden's words, but it cut off before the conclusion of Biden's sentence at a rally in St. Louis. Conservatives called the video an obvious attempt to highlight Biden's verbal gaffes, and argued that no one would reasonably mistake it for a genuine Biden endorsement. ""Understandably, the Biden campaign has a strategic interest in intimidating social media companies into suppressing true and embarrassing video evidence of Joe Biden’s continued inability to communicate coherently—a sad truth that has been publicly noted by Democrats and media figures alike,"" Trump campaign chief operating officer Michael Glassner wrote in the missive to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, general counsel Vijaya Gadde, and public policy director Carlos Monje. ""Still, it appears that many people employed by Big Tech corporations in Silicon Valley are assisting the Biden campaign by instituting a special ‘Biden protection rule’ that effectively censors and silences legitimate political speech Biden’s campaign and its supporters do not like,"" he added in the letter, obtained by Fox News. Glassner said he was ""formally requesting that Twitter apply its new 'manipulated media' label to a doctored and deceptively edited video tweeted by the Biden campaign less than a week ago."" That was a reference to a March 3 video uploaded by the Biden campaign that contains a slew of clips that are taken out of context, and ""manipulates audio and video of President Trump in order to mislead Americans and give a false impression,"" Glassner wrote. The video, Glassner points out, contains two clips ""spliced together to fabricate a quote and give viewers the false impression that he called the coronavirus a 'hoax,'"" a claim that the non-partisan International Fact-Checking Network has previously debunked. The president in fact called Democrats' response to the coronavirus ""their new hoax."" Additionally, the Biden video effectively repeats a false claim the former vice president himself made in his campaign launch video, asserting through selective editing that the president called white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va. ""very fine people."" That assertion, although widely made in progressive circles, is untrue; the president was referring to protesters on both sides of the issue of whether Confederate statues should be removed from public places as ""very fine people."" ""In fact, 49 seconds after President Trump said those words, he said, 'and I’m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally,'"" Glassner wrote. ""As one CNN anchor said, 'he’s not saying that the neo-Nazis and white supremacists are very fine people[.]'"". ""If Twitter is not seeking to protect Joe Biden, we urge it to correct its apparent oversight and apply its standards equally across the board."" Third, the Biden video contains a 2016 clip in which then-candidate Trump declares ""the American Dream is dead"" -- but leaves out the second part of Trump's sentence, in which he says, ""but if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.” READ THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN'S LETTER TO TWITTER CEO ""Of course, this is not the first time the Biden campaign has used editing tricks to manipulate video and feed misinformation to the American people,"" Glassner wrote. ""If Twitter is not seeking to protect Joe Biden, we urge it to correct its apparent oversight and apply its standards equally across the board."" Fox News has identified several other videos posted to Biden's Twitter account that contain similar misleading clips. An October 2019 post on Biden's campaign account, for example, states that Trump ""has asked foreign governments to interfere in our elections,"" and is accompanied by a video of a White House interview that omits Trump's full remarks. In the full interview, Trump says, ""I think maybe you do both,"" referring to notifying the FBI as well as listening to an offer of political help from a foreign entity; but in the Biden clip, Trump says only that he would ""listen"" to the proposal from a foreign entity. Glassner made clear that the Trump campaign was not backing off its original video of Biden, saying the clip was ""a 100 percent real, 100 percent authentic, 100 percent unedited video of Joe Biden saying, 'We cannot win this re-election. Excuse me. We can only re-elect Donald Trump[.]'"" TRUMP EMBRACES MUDDLED BIDEN 'ENDORSEMENT,' AS COMPETENCY CONCERNS MOUNT In order for American elections to remain ""free and fair,"" Glassner wrote, ""it is critical that the Biden campaign be held to the same standard it is demanding apply to others."" In the post uploaded by Scavino, Biden seemingly endorses the president after stammering over some words. ""Turn this primary from a campaign that's about negative attacks into one about what we're for, because we cannot get -- re-elect -- we cannot win this re-election -- excuse me. We can only re-elect Donald Trump,"" Biden says in the edited clip. In the full speech, Biden went on to add,"" -- if, in fact, we get engaged in this circular firing squad here. Gotta be a positive campaign, so join us."" Twitter quickly labeled the tweet ""misinformation,"" in the social media giant's first-ever use of its new policy, which is ostensibly designed to combat the spread of false news. The so-called Synthetic and Manipulated Media policy states that ""you may not deceptively share synthetic or manipulated media that are likely to cause harm."" The policy went into effect Mar. 5 after a campaign video from Mike Bloomberg's team added crickets and a long silence when Bloomberg asked his rivals if any of them had started a business. Facebook has said that the Trump video would not meet its platform for deceptive editing. Currently, no misinformation flag appears on the video for some users when it is directly clicked, although a warning does appear if the video shows up in a user's feed. Twitter has said it is working to apply the warning whenever the clip is accessed. BILLIONAIRE REPUBLICAN BUYS MAJOR STAKE IN TWITTER, COULD OUST CEO SOON The broader issue of Biden's potential competency issues looms large over the 2020 presidential race. Also in St. Louis, Biden bizarrely described himself as an ""O'Biden Bama"" Democrat, transposing his name and the name of his old boss. Trump suggested at a Fox News Town Hall last week that Biden isn't fit for office. ""I'm all set for Bernie, communist,"" Trump began. ""And then we have this crazy thing that happened on Tuesday, which he [Biden] thought was Thursday.

"                          Reaction from former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise. I found myself thinking over the weekend that with Joe Biden now favored to win the nomination, it won’t be long before the press starts the quadrennial veepstakes ritual. And yesterday—boom!—it arrived in spades. The coronavirus may be spreading worldwide, Wall Street may be having a bloodbath, and Biden has yet to beat Bernie Sanders in Michigan and other key states. But nothing stops the VP speculation. GENDER QUESTIONS SWIRL AS WARREN LEAVES RACE TO TWO OLD MEN There’s an added twist this year, which is the widespread expectation—and, in some quarters, demand—that the Democratic running mate will be a woman. As the New York Times put it, “prominent Democrats began publicly insisting that the ticket include a woman, preferably a black woman.” There is a pressure campaign, to be sure, but it also makes good political sense for a 77-year-old nominee to pick someone who can take over the presidency—and, in a year when four women were knocked out of the race, to choose someone of a different gender. “There must be a woman on this ticket,” Cecile Richards, the longtime abortion rights activist who helped found Supermajority, told the paper. I guess that’s what activists do. Given that there have been exactly two female VP nominees—Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 and Sarah Palin in 2008—a woman who actually won the vice presidency would be a definite milestone, even if Elizabeth Warren supporters are still fuming about alleged sexism. Needless to say, a woman at that level of the White House would also be a strong contender to succeed a septuagenarian president, who might serve only one term. (Sanders also says he’ll consider a woman if he wins the nomination fight.) The Times, turning it on the president, says “such a choice could generate enthusiasm from female voters who make up the backbone of the party and sharpen their contrast with Mr. Trump, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by nearly a dozen women.” Now comes the inevitable journalistic parlor game: Who? SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES Washington Post Editorial Page Editor Fred Hiatt says the search should start with Warren, Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand, “who gained stature and name recognition” during the campaign. The problem: “They all lost, and they all had time to rub at least some voters the wrong way.” I’m not sure Warren is a great pick because she’s 70 (not much of a youth movement there) and so much more progressive (she backs Medicare-for-All, which Biden has denounced). Harris might seem like a long shot after she eviscerated Biden on the debate stage over busing in the 1970s. But the former VP is said to like her because she was friendly with his late son Beau. Hiatt then floats such governors as Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island and Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico, as well as Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer, his new national co-chair. He throws in some mayors as well. My take: If Biden selects someone who most of America has never heard of, he starts out behind. The media vetting of whether that person is qualified to assume the presidency would start from scratch, and all kinds of things pop up. That hurt John McCain when he picked the relatively inexperienced Sarah Palin in 2008, and makes the choice a wild card. The Week does some handicapping: Warren “would help excite women — above all highly educated professional women,” but that she “dramatically underperformed” in the campaign. Klobuchar would “bolster Biden’s moderate bona fides,” but “failed to generate much enthusiasm among voters.” Harris “exudes energy and compassion” and having a woman of color would be a plus. As for Stacey Abrams, she’s not ready for prime time “as an author, voting-rights activist, former Georgia state representative, failed candidate for governor, and a celebrity of sorts among woke progressives and academics.” In the end, running mates don’t matter all that much. Donald Trump didn’t win because of Mike Pence, Hillary Clinton didn’t lose because of Tim Kaine, and Barack Obama didn’t win because of Biden. But given Biden’s age and the Democratic hunger for a woman on the ticket, whoever gets the nod might matter more this year than in the recent past. Footnote: Axios goes further with Biden’s “secret governing plan”: basically an assortment of names being floated for top jobs. They include John Kerry, Susan Rice, Mike Bloomberg, Jamie Dimon, Warren and Pete Buttigieg. But one you can basically count on: If Biden wins, adviser Ron Klain, his chief of staff as VP—and the Obama czar for the Ebola outbreak—will be White House chief of staff.

"                          Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders joins moderators Martha MacCallum and Bret Baier for a Fox News town hall in Dearborn, Michigan. Underscoring what’s at stake for his White House bid when Michigan and five other states hold Democratic presidential nomination contests on Tuesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders emphasizes that “this is a very, very important day in Michigan.” Speaking in front of more than 10,000 people at a rally at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, the populist senator from Vermont on Sunday spotlighted that Michigan’s “the most important state” to hold a contest on March 10, which is being dubbed ‘mini Super Tuesday’ or ‘Super Tuesday 2.0.’       Democratic presidential candidate U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., speaks during a campaign rally at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Mich., Sunday, March 8, 2020. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya)       MARCH 10 PRIMARY PRIMER: THE STATES AND THE STAKES With 125 pledged delegates at stake, Michigan is the biggest prize among the six states holding contests on Tuesday. The others are Missouri, Mississippi, Washington state, Idaho and North Dakota. Sanders, a populist senator who’s making his second-straight presidential run, defeated eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016's primary in Michigan, in what was considered a major upset victory. That foreshadowed Clinton’s narrow loss to Donald Trump in the November 2016 general election in Michigan. Trump’s victory with working-class white voters in the state, as well as similar narrow wins in two other crucial Rust Belt states – Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – propelled him to the White House. The pre-Michigan primary polls in 2016 got it all wrong – as they indicated Clinton with a double-digit lead over Sanders. “The 2016 Michigan Democratic primary is considered to be the biggest polling miss of that cycle. Polls released in the week before the state primary showed Hillary Clinton with anywhere from a 10 to 27 point lead,"" noted Monmouth University pollster Patrick Murray. Fast forward four years and former Vice President Joe Biden’s now the clear front-runner in Michigan with the final polls released on primary eve indicating the former vice president with a double-digit lead over Sanders. But Sanders is holding out hope for a repeat performance that would stave off elimination and instead boost the senator back into a massive battle with Biden for the nomination. An optimistic Sanders predicted on Fox News Sunday “I think we're gonna do well on Tuesday, and we're gonna beat Biden.”  While a loss would be considered a setback, Sanders doesn’t see such a prospect as fatal. “I certainly would not consider dropping out,” he stressed. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 20S0 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN  Sanders was the front-runner for the Democratic nomination after winning the Feb. 11 New Hampshire primary and then shellacking the field a week and a half later at the Nevada caucuses. But thanks to his landslide victory in South Carolina a week and a half ago – and a strong performance during last week’s Super Tuesday when he swept 10 of the 14 states holding primaries on Super Tuesday and took the lead over Sanders in the all-important race for Democratic nomination convention delegates – Biden’s moved closer to locking up the nomination. Because of its general election political symbolism and the large delegate cache, Michigan’s capturing the lion’s share of media attention among this week’s round of contests. Biden - very cognizant of the polling debacle in 2016 – stressed on Monday that “I’m kind of superstitious, I see all these polls...I remember Hillary was up by 23 points...I don’t take anything for granted.” Biden, with an eye on November’s general election, emphasized during a rally Monday in Flint that “Michigan is an important contest not just for the Democratic primary, because the outcome of Michigan in November may determine who the next person United States is going to be.” The former vice president’s enjoyed a tidal wave of endorsements from current and former members of Congress and governors the past 10 days - as the party establishment and other moderates all coalesced around Biden to prevent Sanders – a self-described democratic socialist – from becoming the party’s standard-bearer in November’s general election. And many of his former rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination have endorsed his White House bid. Two of those one-time rivals – Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California – joined Biden on the campaign trail in Michigan on Monday after backing him just in the past 24 hours. Sanders, fighting for survival, has increased his jabs at Biden in the wake of Super Tuesday. At a Fox News town hall on primary eve in Detroit, Sanders charged that Biden had ""bailed out the crooks on Wall Street who nearly destroyed our economy 12 years ago."" But he failed to mention that $700 billion rescue plan also had the support of then-presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain. A day earlier in Ann Arbor, Sanders slammed the former vice president  - saying “here we are a few days before a major primary here in Michigan. And we are taking on, in this campaign, not just Joe Biden….We're taking on the 60 billionaires who are funding his campaign. Biden, in a much more comfortable position, has refrained from blasting Sanders. Instead, on Monday he gently jabbed his rival, saying “we’re not looking for a revolution.” The push for a political revolution has long been a staple of Sanders stump speech. But the former vice president’s aiming for what he hopes will a be a near knockout punch to Sanders. Democratic strategist Michael Ceraso – a veteran of the 2016 Sanders campaign and the 2020 White House bid by former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg – stressed that a Biden victory in Michigan coupled with likely wins in Missouri and Mississippi will “put a huge hurdle in front of Sanders to get the delegates he needs to win.”    ",         Sanders fights for another Rust Belt upset to regain momentum against Biden,         2020-03-09T231941-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/sanders-fights-for-another-rust-belt-upset-to-regain-momentum-against-biden,Fox
"                          Illinois Governor Rauner on why the Supreme Court's ruling is a big victory. The plaintiff whose 2018 case led to a Supreme Court ruling that mandatory public union agency fees for nonmembers were unconstitutional is now asking the high court to force the union that represented him to return a portion of the money it collected before that decision. In this most recent case, Janus v. AFSCME III, plaintiff Mark Janus is asking for the union to pay back fees it took from his paycheck before the landmark ruling in his 2018 case. He claims that the Supreme Court's ruling should be retroactive, echoing other claims that have been made in federal court, including a sweeping class action that was filed in California last year. SUPREME COURT AT APPARENT ODDS OVER KEY ABORTION CASE ON CLINIC ACCESS RESTRICTIONS ""The Supreme Court agreed that the union taking money from nonmembers was wrong but the union still has the money it illegally garnished from my paycheck,"" Janus said in a press release through the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, one of the organizations handling his case.       Tommy Few, alongside California Policy Center attorney Mark Bucher, Liberty Justice Institute attorney Brian Kelsey, and Mark Janus (L-R).      (Courtesy of Will Swaim/CPC) Janus is seeking the return of about $3,000 in fees taken from his paycheck between 2013 and 2018. ""Mark Janus is just one of many public employees whose money was illegally taken by government unions,” said Patrick Hughes, Liberty Justice Center president and co-founder. Liberty Justice Center is the other group working on Janus' case. “Workers across the country are rightfully asking for their money back,"" Hughes continued. ""It is time for the U.S. Supreme Court to weigh in on this issue and finally hold unions accountable for their years of unconstitutional behavior."" The district court and the Seventh Circuit each ruled that AFSCME, while acting legally under Illinois state law to collect agency fees, was acting in good faith and does not need to pay Janus back any money that was collected before his 2018 Supreme Court victory. ""Until [the Janus decision] said otherwise, AFSCME had a legal right to receive and spend fair-share fees collected from nonmembers as long as it complied with state law ... It did not demonstrate bad faith when it followed these rules,"" the Seventh Circuit said in its opinion. Janus disputes this argument, saying that whether or not the union thought it was complying with the law does not matter. CONSERVATIVE LEADERS SIGN LETTER CALLING FOR SCHUMER CENSURE OVER ALLEGED THREATS TO KAVANAUGH, GORSUCH ""Under Janus, a union deprives public employees of their First Amendment Rights by taking their money without affirmative consent,"" Janus' brief asking the Supreme Court to hear his case says. ""A union's intent when doing so is immaterial."" The 2018 Janus ruling barred mandatory agency fees on First Amendment grounds, arguing that the money given to the union went to causes and speech that Janus -- and presumably at least some other public employees -- disagreed with. Unions are often significant boosters for Democrats and liberal causes. At the time, liberals and unions were concerned that banning mandatory agency fees would lead to significant financial hardships for public sector unions and eventually a ""death spiral."" ""Because unions will retain their role as exclusive bargaining representatives, they will still have to gather information on public safety employees' needs, engage in collective bargaining, and enforce collective bargaining agreements, even when particular violations only involve nonmembers,"" a brief submitted for the 2018 Janus case by a group of public safety employee unions said. ""Consequently, many unions risk a 'death spiral': unions will have to raise dues to make up the budget shortfall attributable to the elimination of fair-share fees, causing membership numbers to fall, which will necessitate raising dues further, and so on."" To be sure, unions have done well since the 2018 Supreme Court ruling. AFSCME has even boasted about its financial health. WHO ARE THE 9 JUSTICES OF THE SUPREME COURT? But a ruling against the unions again could open the floodgates to more lawsuits from workers who also want a refund of their agency fees that were collected before 2018. While Janus is only seeking about $3,000 in his claim, the groups backing Janus' suit said in a press release that they are working on over 30 cases similar to this one, totaling a whopping $120 million in requested refunds. These are not the only type of post-Janus challenges to union power before the Supreme Court, however. The high court is expected to decide this term whether it will hear the case of a University of Maine professor who is arguing that not only should public-sector unions be barred from taking mandatory agency fees, but they should not be allowed exclusive representation of all employees in a workplace. ""The union still has the ability to be my exclusive representative,” Jonathan Reisman, the plaintiff in the case, said in a video produced by the organization representing him. “And I’m still associated with the positions that they take. That really is the problem."" Seventh Circuit Judge Daniel Manion, in a concurring opinion on the latest Janus challenge, agreed that the ""good faith"" defense protected AFSCME from further financial liability in Janus' suit. But he said the union should consider itself fortunate to have unconstitutionally collected agency fees for 41 years under law the Supreme Court later said was wrong. That is a sentiment some conservative justices may latch onto in a potential ruling against AFSCME if the Supreme Court agrees to hear the case. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""Even though the Supreme Court reached the wrong result [in a case decades before its landmark 2018 ruling], the unions justify their acceptance of many millions of dollars because they accepted the money in 'good faith,'"" Manion wrote. ""Probably a better way of looking at it would be to say rather than good faith, they had very 'good luck' in receiving this windfall for so many years. Since the court is not holding that the unions must repay a portion of the windfall, they can remind themselves of their good luck for the years ahead.""

"                          Jenny Beth Martin, chairman of the Tea Party Patriots, and Democratic strategist Mustafa Tameez joins the debate. EXCLUSIVE: The Trump campaign has sent a scathing letter to Twitter's leadership after the platform took the unprecedented step of labeling one of its videos ""manipulated media,"" saying that under the social media giant's new standard, Joe Biden's team has uploaded its own ""doctored and deceptively edited"" video as recently as last week. “The Biden campaign is scared as hell that voters will see the flood of unedited and embarrassing verbal stumbles that will continue go viral if ‘Status Quo Joe’ is the nominee,"" Trump campaign rapid response director Andrew Clark told Fox News. ""Twitter shouldn’t be an enforcement arm of Joe Biden’s campaign strategy, but if they choose to police every video clip they must hold his own campaign to the same standard.” The confrontation began this weekend when Trump communications director Dan Scavino tweeted an edited version of a Biden speech in which the former vice president appears to deliver a muddled and inadvertent endorsement of Trump. Scavino's clip, which the president later reposted, did not alter any of Biden's words, but it cut off before the conclusion of Biden's sentence at a rally in St. Louis. Conservatives called the video an obvious attempt to highlight Biden's verbal gaffes, and argued that no one would reasonably mistake it for a genuine Biden endorsement. ""Understandably, the Biden campaign has a strategic interest in intimidating social media companies into suppressing true and embarrassing video evidence of Joe Biden’s continued inability to communicate coherently—a sad truth that has been publicly noted by Democrats and media figures alike,"" Trump campaign chief operating officer Michael Glassner wrote in the missive to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, general counsel Vijaya Gadde, and public policy director Carlos Monje. ""Still, it appears that many people employed by Big Tech corporations in Silicon Valley are assisting the Biden campaign by instituting a special ‘Biden protection rule’ that effectively censors and silences legitimate political speech Biden’s campaign and its supporters do not like,"" he added in the letter, obtained by Fox News. Glassner said he was ""formally requesting that Twitter apply its new 'manipulated media' label to a doctored and deceptively edited video tweeted by the Biden campaign less than a week ago."" That was a reference to a March 3 video uploaded by the Biden campaign that contains a slew of clips that are taken out of context, and ""manipulates audio and video of President Trump in order to mislead Americans and give a false impression,"" Glassner wrote. The video, Glassner points out, contains two clips ""spliced together to fabricate a quote and give viewers the false impression that he called the coronavirus a 'hoax,'"" a claim that the non-partisan International Fact-Checking Network has previously debunked. The president in fact called Democrats' response to the coronavirus ""their new hoax."" Additionally, the Biden video effectively repeats a false claim the former vice president himself made in his campaign launch video, asserting through selective editing that the president called white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va. ""very fine people."" That assertion, although widely made in progressive circles, is untrue; the president was referring to protesters on both sides of the issue of whether Confederate statues should be removed from public places as ""very fine people."" ""In fact, 49 seconds after President Trump said those words, he said, 'and I’m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally,'"" Glassner wrote. ""As one CNN anchor said, 'he’s not saying that the neo-Nazis and white supremacists are very fine people[.]'"". ""If Twitter is not seeking to protect Joe Biden, we urge it to correct its apparent oversight and apply its standards equally across the board."" Third, the Biden video contains a 2016 clip in which then-candidate Trump declares ""the American Dream is dead"" -- but leaves out the second part of Trump's sentence, in which he says, ""but if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.” READ THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN'S LETTER TO TWITTER CEO ""Of course, this is not the first time the Biden campaign has used editing tricks to manipulate video and feed misinformation to the American people,"" Glassner wrote. ""If Twitter is not seeking to protect Joe Biden, we urge it to correct its apparent oversight and apply its standards equally across the board."" Fox News has identified several other videos posted to Biden's Twitter account that contain similar misleading clips. An October 2019 post on Biden's campaign account, for example, states that Trump ""has asked foreign governments to interfere in our elections,"" and is accompanied by a video of a White House interview that omits Trump's full remarks. In the full interview, Trump says, ""I think maybe you do both,"" referring to notifying the FBI as well as listening to an offer of political help from a foreign entity; but in the Biden clip, Trump says only that he would ""listen"" to the proposal from a foreign entity. Glassner made clear that the Trump campaign was not backing off its original video of Biden, saying the clip was ""a 100 percent real, 100 percent authentic, 100 percent unedited video of Joe Biden saying, 'We cannot win this re-election. Excuse me. We can only re-elect Donald Trump[.]'"" TRUMP EMBRACES MUDDLED BIDEN 'ENDORSEMENT,' AS COMPETENCY CONCERNS MOUNT In order for American elections to remain ""free and fair,"" Glassner wrote, ""it is critical that the Biden campaign be held to the same standard it is demanding apply to others."" In the post uploaded by Scavino, Biden seemingly endorses the president after stammering over some words. ""Turn this primary from a campaign that's about negative attacks into one about what we're for, because we cannot get -- re-elect -- we cannot win this re-election -- excuse me. We can only re-elect Donald Trump,"" Biden says in the edited clip. In the full speech, Biden went on to add,"" -- if, in fact, we get engaged in this circular firing squad here. Gotta be a positive campaign, so join us."" Twitter quickly labeled the tweet ""misinformation,"" in the social media giant's first-ever use of its new policy, which is ostensibly designed to combat the spread of false news. The so-called Synthetic and Manipulated Media policy states that ""you may not deceptively share synthetic or manipulated media that are likely to cause harm."" The policy went into effect Mar. 5 after a campaign video from Mike Bloomberg's team added crickets and a long silence when Bloomberg asked his rivals if any of them had started a business. Facebook has said that the Trump video would not meet its criteria for deceptive editing. Currently, no misinformation flag appears on the video for some users when it is directly clicked, although a warning does appear if the video shows up in a user's feed. Twitter has said it is working to apply the warning whenever the clip is accessed. ""We've received the letter and intend to respond,"" a Twitter spokesperson told Fox News. The Biden video that the Trump campaign flagged was posted two days after Twitter's manipulated-media policy went into effect, and Twitter has previously said it won't apply its new rules retroactively. BILLIONAIRE REPUBLICAN BUYS MAJOR STAKE IN TWITTER, COULD OUST CEO SOON The broader issue of Biden's potential competency issues looms large over the 2020 presidential race. Also in St. Louis, Biden bizarrely described himself as an ""O'Biden Bama"" Democrat, transposing his name and the name of his old boss. Trump suggested at a Fox News Town Hall last week that Biden isn't fit for office. ""I'm all set for Bernie, communist,"" Trump began. ""And then we have this crazy thing that happened on Tuesday, which he [Biden] thought was Thursday. But he also said 150 million people were killed with guns, and that he was running for the U.S. Senate -- there's something going on there.""

"                          Female reporters, pundits decry her withdrawal. In the days since Super Tuesday, the Democratic primary fight has winnowed to two: former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. That's a far cry from the roughly 25 Democratic candidates who initially threw their hats into the race. So what does one do after running for president? The crop of 2020 Democratic candidates is a large pool to sample. Some have returned to their full-time jobs on Capitol Hill, others have started nonprofits to channel their ideas, and a few have been stumping for one of the finalists. Read on for a look at what these also-rans are doing now. Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, who suspended his campaign on Feb. 11, returned to the Centennial State and has hosted several town halls in the last month. Minutes after New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker’s mid-January drop, he filed his reelection papers with the Federal Election Commission to start raising money for his November race in New Jersey. Booker is the latest former candidate to become a Biden endorser, announcing his support Monday morning. Booker was preceded in his support for Biden by California Sen. Kamala Harris, who joined Team Joe on Sunday. Both Booker and Harris campaigned in Michigan for Biden Monday night. Harris originally left the crowded Democratic field to fulfill her duties on Capitol Hill during the impeachment trial. Since the trial's end she’s been lending her name to help elect Todd Gloria as San Diego Mayor and has returned to her seat on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, where she recently made news in her questioning of acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand has been outspoken on Capitol Hill and on social media since suspending her presidential campaign in August. Gillibrand has posted supportive messages for her fellow Democratic candidates and vowed in the coming months to work on flipping the Senate and electing whoever wins the Democratic primary. She is one of the few former candidates who has yet to make an endorsement. Instead, she has been working on legislation that “checks” the Trump administration as well as less divisive measures like a bill to combat the rise of prescription drug costs and her new Data Protection Act, which would create what she calls a consumer watchdog agency to hold companies in the digital marketplace accountable for violating data protection and privacy laws. Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee has shifted his 2020 focus to a third gubernatorial term. He announced his reelection bid in August, a day after ending his presidential campaign. If successful, he'll join Republican Dan Evans as one of two three-term governors in Washington history. Washington state has been the focal point of coronavirus cases in the U.S., and Inslee has declared a state of emergency as the government marshals resources to combat the virus. Sen. Elizabeth Warren made an appearance on ""Saturday Night Live"" over the weekend after suspending her campaign late last week. She has yet to make an endorsement but is facing pressure to turn her supporters toward Sanders. The other Coloradan in the race, former Gov. John Hickenlooper, dropped out in August. While he initially said he had no interest in the Senate, he ultimately changed his mind. The former two-term governor heads a field of Democrats hoping to face Republican Cory Gardner in November. On Monday morning, right against the deadline, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock filed for a Senate run. This announcement came three months after the suspension of his presidential bid and after many months on the trail declaring he would not challenge incumbent Republican Gov. Steve Daines. Last month, he met with former President Obama in Washington and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in Montana. Former Rep. John Delaney has been weighing a run for governor of Maryland in 2022, a person familiar with the matter said. A campaign spokeswoman declined to comment. U.S. Representative for Massachusetts Seth Moulton has been acting as a surrogate for the Joe Biden campaign since January, while Julian Castro, the former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Obama, joined Warren’s campaign efforts until her suspension last Friday. On Feb. 23, after his victory in the Nevada caucuses, Marianne Williamson, an author and inspirational speaker, endorsed Sanders. Just last Thursday she joined Martha McCallum on Fox News' “The Story” to defend Sanders from Democratic strategist James Carville’s notion that Democrats need to unite around a Biden presidency, calling it “outrageous”. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar never truly left the campaign trail, though she did return to Washington D.C. for a quick vote on the coronavirus spending package. She made the announcement of her campaign suspension in the same speech that she started her duties as a Biden surrogate after rerouting a charter flight from her scheduled event in Oklahoma to Biden’s in Texas. She has made several stops in support of the former vice president since, primarily in the key delegate-rich state of Michigan. Beto O'Rourke, the former congressman from Texas, poured his resources into his political action committee, Powered by People, and – after a brief period of reflection in which he grew a beard – has been working to help Democrats win the Texas House this November. Last week he endorsed Joe Biden on the same day as Senator Klobuchar and former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg. He then took Biden for a livestreamed meal at Whataburger. After a disappointing finish in the New Hampshire primary, entrepreneur Andrew Yang was almost immediately scooped up by CNN to be a commentator, debuting his insight during their post-Nevada debate coverage hardly a week later. He also relentlessly teased his online following about a new project, a nonprofit inspired by his campaign messaging, ""Humanity Forward,"" which he announced last week. Humanity Forward has already raised over $3 million that will be dispersed as a part of his Universal Basic Income experiment. Entrepreneur and billionaire Tom Steyer has returned to the head of his voter registration non-profit Next Gen America after leaving the race Feb. 29 after a disappointing finish in South Carolina. He opined over the weekend in The New York Times that ""this campaign has reinforced my passion for spending all my time and money to change the political neglect that has brought this nation to a very low place."" Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg has been downplaying his endorsement of Biden since he delivered it after he suspended his campaign following Super Tuesday. On Monday morning, Bloomberg announced that he donated $2 million to Collective Future to fund the registration of 500,000 black voters before the November election.

"                          Sanders predicts a win in the state; Michigan Republican Rep. Bill Huizenga weighs in. A Bernie Sanders campaign rally this weekend featured an imam who previously said ISIS is ""connected to Israel"" as part of a conspiracy to kill people in order to make Islam look bad as a religion. Imam Sayed Hassan al-Qazwini spoke at Sanders' rally in Dearborn, Mich., according to The Detroit News, lauding Sanders for the fact that he ""united Americans."" But the imam, like many of Sanders' surrogates and associates, has a history of incendiary comments. SANDERS HIRES ADVISOR WHO BLAMED AMERICA FOR 9/11, QUESTIONED BIN LADEN OP, MOCKED MICHELLE OBAMA'S LOOKS ""ISIS somehow is connected to Israel,"" the imam said, according to an archived video posted to Twitter by the Middle East Media Research Institute. ""And ISIS is playing the role of the arm of the Zionists in the Muslim world to kill more Muslims and non-Muslims so it can define the name of Islam, so people can blame Islam for its atrocities, so people will be alienated from this religion."" The imam went on in the comments to claim that Muslims in the United States and Europe were being put in danger by the actions of ISIS and that ""the number one beneficiary of all these atrocities, I tell you, is the Zionists, and it is the Zionist regime."" Al-Qazwini is not the first Sanders surrogate to make such explosive comments. The Sanders campaign over the weekend added artist and organizer Phillip Agnew to its official staff. Agnew had previously insulted Michelle Obama's appearance multiple times, made controversial remarks about the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the U.S., and cast doubt on whether the Obama administration actually killed Usama bin Laden.

"                          Sanders invites Buttigieg supporters to join his campaign; Peter Doocy has the details. The race for the Democratic presidential nomination is a battle for delegates. As five major Democratic candidates have suspended their campaigns over the past week and a half, the lightning-fast winnowing of the field prompts the question: what happens to the delegates they have won? THE LATEST REPORTING FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN Read on for an explanation. How many delegates are needed to win? In this year’s Democratic nomination campaign, 1,991 pledged delegates are needed for a candidate to formally clinch the nomination at July’s Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. Where does the delegate race stand? Heading into the March 10 primaries and caucuses, former Vice President Joe Biden has 670 delegates, giving him a 96-delegate lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has 574. The only other remaining candidate in the race, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, has two delegates. How many delegates do these former candidates have?       Former 2020 Democratic candidates Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, former New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg, former South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.       Before dropping out, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts earned 69 delegates, former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg won 61, former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg won 26, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota won seven. So what happens to these delegates? It's complicated. The short answer is that some of those delegates will eventually be redistributed to other candidates still in the race while others will become ""free agents"" at this summer’s convention. According to the rules adopted by the Democratic National Committee, what happens to those delegates depends on how they were won. There are two ways for a candidate to win delegates: by hitting the 15 percent statewide threshold or by reaching 15 percent in a congressional district. Tell me about statewide pledged delegates. Statewide pledged delegates will be reallocated to candidates still in the race when the state parties hold conventions, which typically take place after a primary and before the national convention. In this case, that means either Biden or Sanders – or theoretically Gabbard as of now – will pick up delegates. Political scientist Josh Putnam – the author of the political website Frontloading HQ – took to Twitter a few days ago to game out what would happen to the 49 statewide delegates won by former candidates. The quick answer is that they would be nearly equally divided by Biden and Sanders. And what about those won at the congressional district level? As for the roughly 114 pledged delegates won at the congressional district level, they are not reallocated in the spring and would head to the July convention as ""free agents,"" according to DNC rules. Some of those delegates may feel an obligation to back whomever their candidate endorsed after dropping out. Bloomberg, Buttigieg and Klobuchar all backed Biden, with Warren staying neutral as of now. Could these delegates play a crucial role in picking the nominee? If the battle to reach 1,991 delegates stays tight between Biden and Sanders, the delegates pledged to the White House hopefuls who dropped out of the race could be a factor in determining which candidate wins the nomination. Technically, all pledged delegates are free to eventually support whomever they want because they are bound to a candidate through a pledge – and nothing more. They could in theory defect and back a different candidate, but that rarely happens.

"                          Dozens of conservative leaders have signed a letter calling for the censure of Democrat Sen. Chuck Schumer over his comments on Supreme Court Justices Kavanaugh and Gorsuch. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is the subject of several ethics complaints following his controversial remarks directed toward Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. In the days following Schumer’s statements at an abortion rights rally outside the court building – comments some described as a threat – complaints were sent to the Senate Ethics Committee and the New York bar’s Grievance Committee, alleging that the Democratic leader’s remarks violated ethics rules. CONSERVATIVE LEADERS SIGN LETTER CALLING FOR SCHUMER CENSURE OVER ALLEGED THREATS TO KAVANAUGH, GORSUCH “At a minimum, Attorney/Senator Schumer’s statements appear to be improper conduct that reflects upon his character and fitness to practice law in New York,” attorney Joseph Gioconda wrote in a letter sent Monday to New York’s Grievance Committee for the Second Judicial District, where Schumer is admitted. Speaking at an event hosted by the Center for Reproductive Rights as the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case focusing on a Louisiana abortion law, Schumer had issued a warning to the two justices appointed by President Trump. ""I want to tell you, Gorsuch. I want to tell you, Kavanaugh. You have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price!"" Schumer said. ""You won’t know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions."" Chief Justice John Roberts was quick to respond, calling Schumer’s words “inappropriate” and “dangerous,” as Schumer reacted by accusing Roberts of being biased in his response. The National Legal Policy Center, a right-leaning nonprofit organization, filed complaints with the New York bar and the Senate Ethics Committee Friday, seeking discipline both for Schumer’s statements at the rally and for calling into question Roberts’ motives for his response. MCCONNELL SLAMS SCHUMER ON SENATE FLOOR FOR CONTROVERSIAL REMARKS DIRECTED AT SUPREME COURT JUSTICES Their complaint claims that Schumer violated Senate ethics rules by engaging in “improper conduct which may reflect upon the Senate.” The NLPC also alleged that Schumer violated New York’s Rules of Professional Conduct through “conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.” The NLPC referenced condemnation from conservatives and liberals alike, citing a critical tweet from Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe that called Schumer’s language “inexcusable,” as well as condemnation on the Senate floor by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who said, “There is nothing to call this except a threat.” Schumer responded to McConnell by admitting that he ""should not have used the words I used,"" and that ""they didn't come out the way I intended to."" Schumer did not apologize but excused himself by saying, “I'm from Brooklyn. We speak in strong language.” The NLPC’s complaint asserts that Schumer’s statement was unsatisfactory. “It strains credulity to believe that, regardless of his Brooklyn pedigree, Sen. Schumer, who is a Harvard-educated lawyer, Senator minority leader, and vocal opponent of both Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, did not intend to choose the exact words he spoke as he turned and pointed to the Supreme Court behind him to further emphasize his point,” the complaint said. “In short, his non-apology is a lame excuse for inexcusable conduct.” The Landmark Legal Foundation, chaired by ""Life, Liberty, & Levin"" host Mark Levin, filed a complaint of their own with the Senate Ethics Committee on Thursday. “The Senate must immediately reprimand, if not censure, Sen. Schumer for his outrageous and dangerous attack on Supreme Court Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh,” said the complaint, which also claimed that Schumer’s statements may have constituted “improper conduct which may reflect upon the Senate.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Both Landmark’s and NLPC’s complaints also alleged possible violations of federal law for threatening an officer of the court. These complaints follow the introduction of a resolution from Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., calling for Schumer to be censured, and a letter to the Senate signed by dozens of well-known conservative leaders calling for censure.

"                          Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders joins moderators Martha MacCallum and Bret Baier for a Fox News town hall in Dearborn, Michigan. As his struggling campaign seeks a big win in Michigan's Tuesday primary, Bernie Sanders took the stage at a Fox News Town Hall in Detroit and wasted little time in dismissing front-runner Joe Biden as a friend to ""crooks"" – and former rival Hillary Clinton as a seemingly bitter ex-candidate stuck in the past. ""I always give this guy a hard time,"" Sanders joked at the outset, referring to Fox News Channel anchor Bret Baier, who was hosting the town hall alongside Martha MacCallum. ""This is going to be fun tonight,"" Baier responded. Within minutes, Sanders took aim at the former vice president, saying Biden had ""bailed out the crooks on Wall Street who nearly destroyed our economy 12 years ago."" That $700 billion rescue plan also had the support of then-presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain. Questioned about Biden's recent verbal gaffes and his broader competence, Sanders remarked, ""I'm not here to criticize Joe, but to say that I think the American people at this incredibly complicated and difficult moment in our history, are entitled to thoughtful answers to the crises we face.""       Fox News Channel anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum question Sanders at the Fox News Town Hall on Monday in Detroit, Mich.       ""I'm not gonna go to that level – that's for people to decide,"" Sanders added, when Baier presented video of Democrats criticizing the former vice president's mental fitness for elected office. ""I’m not going to be making personal attacks on Joe."" The Biden campaign has repeatedly refused Fox News Channel's invitations to participate in a town hall. Separately, prompted by a recent video clip of Clinton claiming that ""nobody likes"" Sanders and that he ""didn't work until he was 41,"" Sanders responded: ""Unlike Secretary Clinton, I don't want to relive 2016. We're in 2020 now."" ""But, what I would say on a good day, is my wife likes me,"" Sanders said to applause. ""But also, if you guys look at some of the polling they do for United States senators, in most cases I turn out to be the most popular senator in the country."" (At the end of the town hall, in response to a question as to who his closest friend is in Washington, Sanders said, ""My wife."") Later, seeking to assure a voter from Russia that his brand of ""democratic socialism"" would not bring widespread poverty and despair to the United States, Sanders said he instead wanted a country more like Denmark, Finland and Sweden. ""What happened in the Soviet Union was not socialism, it was authoritarian communism,"" Sanders said as attendees cheered. ""I'm not an expert on the current economy in Sweden,"" Sanders responded when MacCallum noted Sweden was pushing toward more deregulation and fewer taxes, and that the population in the U.S. is much larger than that of the Nordic countries. ""They have gone a long way to eliminate poverty, to make sure that all of their people have the basic needs that they need to live good lives."" Sanders said studies have shown that countries like Denmark are among the ""happiest on earth,"" because they provide various free services like college and health care. Other studies, however, have shown that Denmark essentially free-rides heavily from U.S. capitalism, and argue that mimicking their welfare programs may backfire. Sanders also slammed President Trump's response to the coronavirus outbreak – and said that he would not consider closing the border, no matter what. ""If you had to, would you close down the borders?"" Baier asked, referring to efforts to stop the spread of coronavirus. ""No,"" Sanders replied flatly. He went on to condemn xenophobia and suggest that scientists would need to outline the appropriate approach. Sanders also hit Trump's appointment of Vice President Mike Pence to lead the coronavirus task force and inaccurately claimed that Trump had advised Americans with the virus to head to work. In fact, Trump told Fox News ""Hannity"" that, empirically, some Americans are going to work with the virus and recovering without incident. ""Sadly, we have an administration in Washington that has shown the world that it does not believe in science,"" Sanders said, taking aim at the White House on issues from climate change to health care. ""When you appoint Vice President Pence, an individual who also doesn't much believe in science, what you're telling the whole world is that you're politicizing this issue."" ""I'm not an expert on the current economy in Sweden."" Baier pressed Sanders on the coronavirus response, saying that Trump has in fact appointed numerous experts to address the issue. Sanders responded by mocking Trump's claim to have a ""natural ability"" to address disasters. ""You listen to the scientists; you don't say stupid things,"" Sanders said. ""You don't suggest to people they can go to work."" Sanders returned to his talking points about the wealthiest people not paying their ""fair share"" in taxes, leading MacCallum to probe whether Sanders would reconsider his policies given the ongoing stock market crisis. SANDERS RELEASES DETAILS ON HOW HE'D PAY FOR MAJOR PROPOSALS -- ARE THERE ISSUES? ""I will not become president until January, and the economic situation will be different then,"" Sanders said. As to what he would do if he were president today, Sanders said an ""economic stimulus"" could come in the form of ""invest[ing] in working-class people in good-paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure – roads, bridges."" He added that ""I'm not here to demonize anybody,"" after MacCallum pointed out that Bill Gates is contributing substantially to coronavirus efforts. At the same time, Sanders said, it was absurd to depend upon the ""generosity"" of billionaires. Then, in a dramatic call-and-response moment with the audience at the town hall, Sanders established that Canada is not a socialist or communist system of government and yet manages to provide government-run health care at a minimal cost to patients. The president, for his part, has derided Canada's health-care system and pointed out that even Canadians complain about their long waiting times, relatively substandard care, and high taxes. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders joins moderators Martha MacCallum and Bret Baier for a Fox News town hall in Dearborn, Michigan. The Vermont senator acknowledged that taxes would go up by 4 percent at a minimum to incomes over $29,000, in addition to more payroll taxes on employers and stock market transaction taxes, but asserted that ""comprehensive"" health care is worth it. Sanders said he wanted a ""modest"" tax on ""Wall Street speculation."" The proposal, according to Sanders' campaign, specifically would place a ""0.5 percent tax on stock trades – 50 cents on every $100 of stock – a 0.1 percent fee on bond trades, and a 0.005 percent fee on derivative trades."" Sanders' campaign has claimed that a ""modest tax on Wall Street speculation ... will raise an estimated $2.4 trillion over 10 years"" and, in one fell swoop, make all ""public colleges, universities and trade schools tuition-free ... and cancel all student debt over the next decade."" However, the National Review has likened a tax on so-called ""Wall Street speculation"" to a de facto tax on savings, and asserted the Sanders plan is untested and ""would mean paying $25 to the federal government every time you traded $5,000 worth of stock — or five times what you’d pay the typical online brokerage in fees. ... Over the long term, that imposes serious costs on actively traded funds such as the ones containing many Americans’ retirement funds.""       Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rev. Jesse Jackson wave to the crowd at a rally for Sanders at Calder Plaza in Grand Rapids, Michigan on Sunday, March 8, 2020. Michigan's presidential primary is Tuesday. (Anntaninna Biondo/The Grand Rapids Press via AP)       At the town hall, Sanders alluded to a disputed Yale University study to argue that ""Medicare-for-all"" would save money largely by cutting down on administrative costs. Other nonpartisan estimates have put the cost of Sanders' ""Medicare-for-all"" proposal at over $32 trillion. Baier and MacCallum moderated Sanders’ second Fox News Town Hall of the election cycle. At last April's event, a combative Sanders made no apologies for his wealth, and acknowledged that his plans would lead to tax hikes for many Americans. Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington will also hold primaries on Tuesday, and a combined 352 delegates will be at stake. Michigan's 125 pledged delegates are the day's biggest prize and offer Sanders an opportunity to cut down front-runner Joe Biden's current 91-delegate lead. SANDERS HIRES ADVISOR WHO BLAMED AMERICA FOR 9/11 Sanders won the Michigan primary over Hillary Clinton in 2016 after taking a beating on Super Tuesday, but this year, surveys show him down by as many as two-dozen points. Biden tops Sanders 51 percent to 36 percent among likely Democratic presidential primary voters in Michigan, a Monmouth University survey released on Monday showed. An outstanding question going into Tuesday is whether Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who dropped out of the race last week, will endorse Biden or Sanders. So far, she's declined to back either, an especially frustrating development for Sanders, who could use Warren's help in unifying progressives in much the same way Biden has been able to rally moderates. Sanders tells Fox News he wouldn't close US borders during coronavirus-type contagion Sanders has scoffed at suggestions he could drop out if he doesn't win Michigan, but his travel schedule underscores its importance. He canceled a trip to Mississippi and instead made five campaign stops across Michigan since Friday. And he held a roundtable in Detroit on Monday with health experts to discuss the spread of the new coronavirus. Sanders has accused Biden of relying on billionaires to finance his campaign but also says he's now running against “the Democratic establishment.” The senator told Fox News on Sunday that he'd win Michigan and repeated that at a rally in Grand Rapids, but he added the major caveat for supporters that he'd only pull it off “if we stick together, we bring our friends out to vote.” FLASHBACK: AT TESTY FNC TOWN HALL, SANDERS MAKES NO APOLOGIES FOR MAKING MILLIONS Sanders won't say if he's personally lobbying Warren for her endorsement. He did manage to secure the backing of Jesse Jackson, who said it was no time for centrist compromise. “With the exception of Native Americans, African-Americans are the people who are most behind socially and economically in the United States and our needs are not moderate,"" Jackson said at Sanders' Grand Rapids rally. “A people far behind cannot catch up choosing the most moderate path.” Still, one of Sanders' highest-profile supporters, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, struck a far more conciliatory tone addressing 10,000-plus on the campus of the University of Michigan on Sunday night, saying, “In order for us to win, we have to grow.”       President Donald Trump gestures while walking on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington on Monday after stepping off Marine One. A “Women for Trump” bus tour has been canceled, the president’s campaign said, citing scheduling conflicts. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)       “We must be inclusive. We must bring more people into this movement,"" she said, urging Sanders supporters to shed “cynicism and exclusion” and “turn with an embracing posture, where all people are welcome in a people's movement.” Sanders is hoping to do well in Washington state on Tuesday, but could face hurdles in Mississippi and Missouri. Sanders' team acknowledges he will also struggle in next week's Florida primary, where the senator's past defense of Fidel Castro looms large. He also could face long odds in Ohio and Illinois — especially if he underperforms in Michigan. Both of those states also vote March 17. The wild card next week could be Arizona, where Sanders will be counting on strong Latino support, which lifted him to victory in California. MARCH 10 PRIMARY PRIMER: THE STATES AND THE STAKES The intricate arithmetic of how delegates are won makes it possible Tuesday for a winning candidate to reap a bigger haul of delegates with a smaller margin of victory than any other night. This gives Biden an opportunity to greatly increase his lead over Sanders or for Sanders to close the gap. Delegates are mostly awarded proportionally in congressional districts. And nearly two-thirds of Tuesday districts have an odd number of delegates up for grabs. When there is an odd number of delegates available, that means one of the two candidates will get more delegates. In districts with an even number of delegates, proportional distribution means that in close races, both candidates get the same number of delegates and that makes it more difficult for Sanders to catch Biden. After March 17, most delegates are in districts with an even number of delegates. Monday's Sanders Fox News Town Hall was the eleventh town hall of the current election season hosted by Fox News and the tenth with a Democratic presidential candidate. FNC’s first town hall with Sanders held the record for the most-watched town hall of the 2020 election cycle with nearly 2.6 million viewers, before Trump's town hall dethroned it with a whopping 4.2 million viewers. Recent Fox News town halls were held with then-Democratic presidential candidates Mike Bloomberg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, both co-moderated by Baier and MacCallum, as well as former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, moderated by Chris Wallace.

"                          We can't find any evidence of coronavirus symptoms among the 10,000 CPAC attendees, says Matt Schlapp, American Conservative Union Chair. Staffers for the Conservative Political Action Conference have reached out to over 100 people who may have come into contact with an individual who tested positive for coronavirus after attending the annual summit at the end of February, Fox News has learned. The steps are part of a behind-the-scenes scramble to respond to the development that has rattled an already-shaken Washington. As the Trump administration and lawmakers scrounge up funding, plan for a national health care response, and grapple with the prospect of a public panic on top of financial market chaos, the presence of a virus-infected individual at the premier conservative gathering only added to an epic logistical challenge. TWO GOP REPS SELF-QUARANTINE AFTER CONTACT WITH CORONAVIRUS PATIENT AT CPAC The top levels of government on the GOP side – President Trump, Vice President Pence, cabinet officials, top-ranking lawmakers – were in attendance. Staffers quickly worked to figure out who may have come in contact with the still-unnamed person. These discussions so far have led to several lawmakers going into self-quarantine as a precaution, amid assurances from organizers that nobody else has yet gotten sick from this individual. But those unusual announcements are just a window into the ongoing efforts to trace potential exposure. Coronavirus patients attending the American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference in Washington last week led to similar concerns, though not quite to this degree. A senior CPAC staffer told Fox News on Tuesday that they and members of their team have been in touch with more than 100 attendees — in addition to the “several” lawmakers known to have interacted with the individual. The infected attendee, who reports indicate is a New York City-based doctor, is currently in a hospital in Englewood, N.J. CPAC would not share or confirm the identity of the individual. New Jersey officials on Tuesday announced the state's first novel coronavirus-related death, but Fox News is told this is not the same individual who attended CPAC. The senior CPAC staffer told Fox News that they have been in regular contact with the individual, as well as his brother, to learn of his condition, and find out if he remembers coming into contact with any additional attendees. The staffer told Fox News that CPAC organizers had asked for the attendee’s phone to go through themselves, but were denied. Nevertheless, they're using the brother as an intermediary to learn more about his contacts. On Monday, the individual’s brother shared with CPAC staffers that he had gone through the phone and uncovered a photo of him with Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga. – who is now in self-quarantine, along with several other lawmakers who came into contact with the patient. A spokesperson for Collins confirmed that Matt Schlapp – chairman of CPAC host the American Conservative Union – contacted the congressman to notify him of the uncovered photo. On Monday, the attending physician for Congress said in a statement that the sick attendee, who was able to recall the majority of individuals he interacted with, came into contact with ""several"" members of Congress. The list of lawmakers going into self-quarantine, as a result, has grown by the day. WHITE HOUSE TAKING 'COMMON SENSE STEPS' TO CURB CORONAVIRUS RISK AT MEETINGS At this time, Schlapp, Collins, Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and now-acting White House chief of staff Mark Meadows are in self-quarantine ""out of an abundance of caution"" after being notified by CPAC organizers that they came into contact with the ill attendee. Three senior members of Gosar’s staff are also self-quarantined. None of the lawmakers, or staffers, are known to be experiencing coronavirus symptoms at this time. The response has fed complaints – including from some in the media – that only high-powered officials are getting to learn whether they were at risk of exposure. But the CPAC staffer told Fox News that not only have they sent mass emails to all attendees of the annual conference and contacted certain lawmakers, but they've contacted dozens of people who are not elected officials – as well as members of the media who were covering the event. Meanwhile, the chain of events has fed speculation about whether Trump himself was at risk, as both the president and Pence attended and spoke at the conference. The White House said there is no indication that Trump or Pence was in close proximity to the stricken attendee. The president did, however, spend time with Collins and Gaetz since CPAC. Collins shook Trump's hand and joined him for a visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Ga., on Friday. He also met with Trump at the White House last week, several days after the Feb. 26-29 conference. Gaetz was spotted riding on Air Force One on Monday as he learned the news. White House officials said when Gaetz learned he was in proximity to the man with coronavirus at CPAC, he sat by himself in a section of the president's plane. Meanwhile, Trump downplayed the threat of coronavirus on Monday, noting that the “common flu” kills thousands of Americans each year and that “life & the economy go on.” “So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year,” Trump tweeted Monday. ""Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus with 22 deaths. Think about that!” According to the CDC, during the 2018-2019 flu season in the U.S., an estimated 35.5 million people were sick with influenza and approximately 34,200 people died from the illness.

"                          Bret Baier, Special Report anchor, discusses why President Trump's handling of coronavirus and its economic consequences is his biggest test heading into November The chairman of the House Democratic caucus blasted President Trump Tuesday for retreating to his Mar-a-Lago golf club with his ""billionaire boys club"" during the coronavirus crisis and then blaming Democrats for not doing enough. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries took issue with Trump's tweet that accused Democrats of not doing enough to respond to the economic effects of the spreading virus before heading to recess next week.       Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)       ""Donald Trump was at a Florida golf resort hanging out with the billionaire boys club in the midst of a global epidemic,"" Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Tuesday when asked about Trump's criticism. ""So we're not going to be lectured by Donald Trump about leadership when he's failed to show a scintilla of it in the midst of this whole crisis.” Trump wants Congress to pass economic stimulus measures to stem economic bleeding from the coronavirus outbreak, including a payroll tax cut, small business aid and help for hourly workers who might become sick. The House and Senate already passed an $8.3 billion aid package to boost the U.S. health care system to respond to the virus. Democrats Tuesday said any economic stimulus plan should be focused on workers, such as expanded sick leave, unemployment benefits, food assistance and health care access. CORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN Their proposals were just coming in focus and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, of California, and other Democrats doubted a vote would be ready this week before they leave Washington for a planned recess. ""In other words, it's off to vacation for the Do Nothing Democrats,"" Trump tweeted Tuesday. ""That's been the story with them for 1 1/2 years!"" Trump spent the weekend at his golf club in Florida where well-heeled Republicans huddled for a fundraising retreat. He visited the Capitol Tuesday to meet with Senate Republicans about the payroll tax cut plans. ""We have a coronavirus that has killed thousands of people throughout the world already,"" Jeffries said. ""We have a stock market that is in complete freefall. We may be heading into a recession.

"                          President Trump addresses the media following meeting with lawmakers on coronavirus at Capitol Hill. President Trump urged Americans to remain calm Tuesday as the government responds to the global outbreak of coronavirus. The president, after meeting with Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill, warned that Americans should exercise caution, but that the situation is being handled and will eventually be resolved. CORONAVIRUS 'CONTAINMENT ZONE' IN NEW YORK COUNTY TO SHUT DOWN FOR 2 WEEKS, UNDERGO CLEANING “We’re prepared and we’re doing a great job with it and it will go away,"" Trump said. “Everybody has to be vigilant and has to be careful, but be calm."" Trump praised his administration's response, saying they ""are doing a fantastic job,"" and referred to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who stated that the federal government has provided everything he has requested from them. Trump himself has yet to be tested, and he said the White House doctor told him there was no reason to do so. This comes after it was discovered that someone at the Conservative Political Action Conference was stricken with coronavirus. Trump attended that summit at the end of last month. ""I don't think it's a big deal,"" Trump said, adding he feels ""extremely good."" Democrats are preparing a package of aid that includes unemployment insurance and sick pay for working families struggling to keep paychecks coming as the outbreak disrupts workplaces and the stock market tumbled Monday. A vote could come as soon as this week or push to mid-March. CORONAVIRUS AT CPAC: DIAGNOSIS TRIGGERS SCRAMBLE TO TRACE EXPOSURE House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., implored lawmakers to keep working to strengthen the country's defenses. Meanwhile, lawmakers were given new instructions on how to protect themselves at the Capitol, with the House's attending physician asking them to stop shaking hands or touching people during greetings – he recommended the split-fingers Star Trek greeting instead. Trump met health insurers at the White House earlier and vowed to help the beleaguered cruise-ship and airline industries. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo also called on the National Guard to help contain a coronavirus ""cluster"" in New Rochelle, located in Westchester County north of New York City.

"                          Jessica Tarlov and Josh Holmes discuss Joe Biden's delegate lead and what Bernie Sanders needs to do to change the momentum **Want FOX News Halftime Report in your inbox every day? Sign up here.**YOUR SKINNY TUESDAY RACE GUIDEDETROIT — Democrats, who once marveled at the sheer enormity of their presidential field like East Germans at an American supermarket, don’t have much left in the way of candidate choices.It’s down to two guys who have been in the principal rival wings of the party since the Vietnam War. And right now, it’s not looking any better for the Yippies than it did back in ‘68.Far out.But if Democrats can’t do much now to change the tune, today they can at least set the tempo.Front-runner Joe Biden is a little bit more than a third of the way to the 1,991 delegates he needs to win the Democratic nomination outright. A big finish today would put Biden more than halfway home even before a majority of delegates have been allocated – an up-tempo number to an early clinch.If Biden doesn’t build on his Super Tuesday surge, however, it could mean a repeat of 2016’s grinding, embittering Democratic contest, with Bernie Sanders’ chasing him to the last contests or, conceivably, even revive the prospect of a contested convention. That sounds more like a work song or even a funeral march.The map today looks good for Biden – as you will see in the tables below. Michigan is the big prize, and it, like Missouri, boasts a large African-American population as well as a significant number of suburbanites: Both keys to his Super Tuesday resurrection last week.Sanders isn’t even bothering to contest Mississippi, where as much as three quarters of the electorate today may be African-American.Sanders is mostly looking out West, where he performed well last week and last cycle – particularly to Washington. He won there in 2016 and the Pacific Northwest has remained a hotbed of Bernie-ism. But there’s considerable downside this time around.The Evergreen State is holding its first presidential primary since 2000, ditching the low-turnout caucus system that helped Sanders and his activist core so much four years ago. In the non-binding primary vote on the ballot in 2016, the result flipped with Clinton winning an easy victory. It’s a similar story in delegate-light Idaho, where Democrats haven’t had a primary since 1984.Sanders’ best shot is in North Dakota, which has maintained the caucus system for awarding its handful of delegates. It was big for Bernie in 2016.If Biden does about as well in the six states holding contests today as his middling average performance in the first 18 states, he would win something shy of 180 delegates. That’s basically meeting the minimum requirement to become his party’s nominee on the first ballot.Let’s call this “The Clintonista.” In this scenario, Biden would do as his predecessor Hillary Clinton did before him: He’d perform at the low end of the acceptable range but not well enough to officially clinch the nomination and dispatch Sanders for another couple of months.That would give Sanders (and the Trump campaign) plenty of time to raise doubts and sew discord ahead of a fraught but anticlimactic convention in Milwaukee. It would also give Biden plenty of time to deepen doubts about his own candidacy. Every debate and every interview Biden would be obliged to do would run the risk of deepening the inevitable buyers’ remorse that voters will feel.If Biden falls much short of that mark, the prospects of a contested convention will rear up like on Democrats like a bad pastrami sandwich. Let’s call that one “The Milwaukee Two Step.” It seems unlikely given the rush we’re seeing toward Biden, but that’s Sanders’ only chance today to credibly keep alive the idea of a convention battle that results in his nomination.But the one that Biden and the rest of the mainstream Democrats are hoping for is a win big enough to relegate Sanders to gadfly status and let Biden go home and rest for a grueling general election. That would mean the front-runner consolidating the support that went to Michael Bloomberg last week, keeping turnout high and snagging two thirds of the available delegates.If Biden hauls out 230 or so delegates out of today it will be a happy Irish tune for him: “The Scranton Reel.”MICHIGAN (125 PLEDGED DELEGATES)OPEN PRIMARYLAST POLLS CLOSE AT 9 PM ETPast results - 2008: Primary not sanctioned by DNC; 2016: Clinton 48.3 percent, Sanders 49.72016 general election - Trump 47.3 percent, Clinton 47 percentOther key races on the ballot today - NoneRace notes - Michigan will be the biggest prize today and it’s clear by the amount of attention the state has been receiving from both campaigns. While Sanders is hoping to repeat his stunning upset 2016 victory in the Wolverine State, recent polling shows a strong lead for Biden. Sanders garners a lot of support from younger voters and members of the Arab American community, but his campaign struggles with support from African Americans, suburban women and voters outside of metro Detroit, which could be his downfall in Michigan. Voter turnout in 2016 broke state records at 2.5 million when there was an open seat for president in addition to competitive down ballot races in both parties. Sanders needs younger voters to come out in force, or Biden could be well on his way to the nomination.WASHINGTON (89 PLEDGED DELEGATES)CLOSED PRIMARYLAST POLLS CLOSE AT 11 PM ETPast results - 2008: Obama 67.6 percent, Clinton 31.2 percent; 2016: Sanders 72.7 percent, Clinton 27.1 percent2016 general election - Clinton 52.5 percent, Trump 36.8 percentOther key races on the ballot today - NoneRace notes - Washington moved up its primary in an effort to take on a more active role in the primary process, but that hasn’t seemed to work out. The two remaining campaigns have little activity on the ground, with no official watch parties scheduled for tonight. A reason for campaign absence could be due to the large number of diagnosed Coronavirus cases in the state. But, thanks to the states all-mail election, voters are expected to be active nonetheless. State elections officials say they’re looking at a robust possible voter turnout record with reports of nearly 1.6 million ballots already in – about 35 percent of the state’s registered voters – as of Monday afternoon.MISSOURI (68 PLEDGED DELEGATES)OPEN PRIMARYLAST POLLS CLOSE AT 8 PM ETPast results - 2008: Obama 49.3 percent, Clinton 47.9 percent; 2016: Clinton 49.6 percent, Sanders 49.4 percent2016 general election - Trump 56.4 percent, Clinton 37.9 percentOther key races on the ballot today - NoneRace notes - While Biden holds solid support from the I-70 corridor from Kansas City to mid-Missouri and St. Louis, Sanders is trying to offset it with support from the rural northern and southern parts of the state. Biden has the backing of the Democratic establishment in the state including an endorsement from Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, one of the state’s ten Superdelegates. Sanders benefits from high volunteer numbers and a base of supporters that have been with him since his narrow loss in 2016. The delegate count today will be determined as follows: The statewide vote will determine 24 delegates while the other 44 will be distributed based on the results in each congressional district.MISSISSIPPI (36 PLEDGED DELEGATES)OPEN PRIMARYLAST POLLS CLOSE AT 8 PM ETPast results - 2008: Obama 61.2 percent, Clinton 36.7 percent; 2016: Clinton 82.5 percent, Sanders 16.6 percent 2016 general election - Trump 57.9 percent, Clinton 40.1 percentOther key races on the ballot today - All four U.S. House members will face primary challenges today: Rep. Trent Kelly, (R), Rep. Bennie Thompson (D), Rep. Michael Guest (R) and Rep. Steven Palazzo (R).  On the Senate side, incumbent Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith is running for her first full six-year term after beating Democrat Mike Espy in the 2018 special election. It is expected that she will face Espy again come November.Race notes - If there is any state to expect a Biden landslide, it’s Mississippi. After the former vice president’s solid performance so far in the South we don’t expect anything less today. Watch for the possibility of Sanders falling short of the viability threshold and a Biden delegate sweep.IDAHO (20 PLEDGED DELEGATES)CLOSED PRIMARYLAST POLLS CLOSE AT 11 PM ETPast results - 2008: Obama 79.5 percent, Clinton 17.2 percent; 2016: Sanders 78 percent, Clinton 21.2 percent2016 general election - Trump 59.3 percent, Clinton 27.5 percentOther key races on the ballot today - NoneRace notes - Idawho? Democrats have mostly ignored the predominantly red Gem State. So much so that none of the candidates attended the state Democratic Party’s key event, the Frank and Bethine Church Gala, last weekend. The Biden and Sanders campaigns both sent video messages and surrogates to represent them instead. Sanders is expected to do well after his strong performance in 2016 in addition to his money spent on ads in the state, where Biden hasn’t spent a dime.

"                          Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday upheld a ruling that allows House Democrats to view secret grand jury information from Robert Mueller’s Russia probe that had been redacted from his report. The court’s 2-1 decision agreed with a lower court that the House Judiciary Committee can obtain the information for impeachment investigations of President Trump under an exception for “judicial proceedings,” per the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. DEVIN NUNES RESPONDS TO CHRISTOPHER STEELE DEFENSE OF DOSSIER: 'PREPOSTEROUS' “[B]ecause that exception encompasses impeachment proceedings and the committee has established a ‘particularized need’ for the grand jury materials, the order of the district court is affirmed,” Judge Judith Rogers wrote in the court’s opinion.                 The lower court had claimed that precedent supported the idea that an impeachment trial is akin to a judicial proceeding, citing a case that allowed the disclosure of grand jury material for the impeachment investigation of President Richard Nixon. Rogers noted that the exception to the grand jury secrecy rule applies in cases “preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding,” and that the party requesting it must show a “particularized need.” The Department of Justice argued that the precedent the lower court cited was not binding, but the D.C. Circuit disagreed. The Circuit Court also agreed that the lower court properly used its discretion in determining that the possibility of new articles of impeachment stemming from the grand jury materials satisfied the requirement for a “particularized need.” FISA COURT BLOCKS FBI AGENTS LINKED TO CARTER PAGE PROBE FROM SEEKING WIRETAPS, OTHER SURVEILLANCE The court’s ruling also noted that the lower court properly concluded that the need to keep the information secret “is reduced by the committee’s adoption of special protocols to restrict access to the grand jury materials in order to maintain their secrecy.” The DOJ, opposing the House Democrats, argued that because Trump had already been impeached and acquitted by the time the court was to rule, there was no longer a basis for the committee needing the information. The committee responded by claiming that their investigation was still continuing and that new articles of impeachment remained a possibility. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The DOJ has the option to now either petition for the case to be reheard by the entire D.C. Circuit in an en banc hearing, or immediately appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. The department has yet to comment on their next step, and spokesperson Kerri Kupec said the DOJ is “reviewing the decision.” Fox News’ David Spunt and Jake Gibson contributed to this report.

"                          Dr. Janette Nesheiwat on what this means for the American people. President Trump on Thursday shrugged off complaints by European Union leaders that they were not consulted before he announced travel restrictions from Europe due to coronavirus -- arguing that the E.U. doesn’t alert the U.S. when it raises tariffs. “We get along well with the European leaders, but we had to make a decision and I didn’t want to take time, and it takes a long time to make the individual calls,” he said in the Oval Office, alongside Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, before adding that he had spoken to some EU leaders before the announcement. EUROPEAN UNION LASHES OUT AT TRUMP OVER TRAVEL BAN AMID CORONAVIRUS CHAOS “But we had to move quickly, I mean when they raise taxes on us, they don’t consult us and I think that’s probably one and the same,” he added. Trump announced late Wednesday that travel from Europe would be restricted for 30 days -- although the U.K. and Ireland are not included. The Department of Homeland Security went on to clarify that it affects most foreign nationals who were in Europe’s passport-free “Schengen Area” within 14 days prior to traveling to the U.S. The area in question consists of 26 countries, including France, Italy, German, Greece, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Norway, and Sweden. The Trump administration had slapped a travel ban on foreign nationals who had visited China and Iran last month. But EU leaders were furious, saying that the global pandemic requires “cooperation rather than unilateral action.” “The European Union disapproves of the fact that the U.S. decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation,” EU Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement. “The European Union is taking strong action to limit the spread of the virus.” CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW Europe has been struggling to get a grip on the crisis, which has virtually shut down countries such as Italy and Denmark. Already, more than 17,000 cases of COVID-19 have been detected in Europe, with the virus having been found in all 27 EU countries. Trump justified the exclusion of the U.K., saying the U.S. ally was doing a “very good job” of combating the crisis. “The U.K. basically has got the border, strong borders and they're doing a very good, job, they don't have much infection and hopefully they'll keep it that way,” he said. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is a close ally of Trump, who has in turn supported Johson's push to take Britain out of the European Union. Trump also said he hopes that the ban will be something that can be ended fairly soon, and said the administration had taken quick action on the ban, similar to that with China. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""We went very early with Europe and I think that will likewise be very good and get it back very quickly,” he said. He went on to call the virus a ""fast spreader"" and that while it is a global crisis, ""you do need separation in some cases."" Varadkar told reporters that his country was shutting down schools and limiting large gatherings as part of an effort to prevent the virus from spreading in the country. There were indications that some European countries were following Trump’s lead. Czech Republic Prime Minister Andrej Babis said people from 13 risk countries that include E.U. countries such as Italy, Spain, France, Austria and Germany as well Britain will not be allowed to enter the country.

"                          Joe Biden lays out his plan to battle coronavirus by calling out President Trump for 'disparaging science' and damaging relationships around the world Joe Biden is shaking up his operation and replacing his Democratic presidential campaign manager as he tries to finish his primary fight with Bernie Sanders to win the Democratic nomination and look ahead to a general election battle ahead with President Trump. The former vice president’s campaign announced Thursday that Jen O’Malley Dillon -- a veteran of Barack Obama’s 2008 and 2012 campaigns and who most recently served as former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s presidential campaign manager -- will succeed Greg Schultz in steering Biden’s White House bid. BIDEN HOLDS MASSIVE LEAD OVER SANDERS IN FLORIDA POLL Biden officials said Schultz will now focus on “organizational planning for the general election and continuing to bolster the campaign’s external outreach.” The move comes as Biden has taken a large lead over Democratic nomination rival Sanders in the crucial race for convention delegates. That's come thanks to major victories in the South Carolina primary and the Super Tuesday states, and this week in Michigan, Missouri, and Mississippi. While Sanders – the populist senator from Vermont – remains in the race, his window to win the nomination is closing fast. “I am grateful to Greg for his leadership and hard work to help get our campaign where it is today, and I will value his continued input on this campaign,” Biden said in a statement.       The former vice president’s campaign announced Thursday that Jen O’Malley Dillon -- a veteran of <a data-cke-saved-href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/barack-obama"" href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/barack-obama"">Barack Obama</a>’s 2008 and 2012 campaigns and who most recently served as former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s presidential campaign manager -- will succeed Greg Schultz in steering Biden’s White House bid.        But before his rebound in South Carolina, Biden’s White House effort was almost left for dead after disappointing fourth and fifth places finishes in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, the first two contests in the presidential nominating calendar. There’s been grumbling inside and outside the campaign over a lack of resources, organizational issues, and especially disappointing fundraising dating back to last April when Biden announced his candidacy. Biden praised O’Malley Dillon, saying he’s “thrilled that Jen is bringing her considerable talent and insight to this team. She will be a tremendous asset to a campaign that is only growing and getting stronger as we prepare to take the fight to Donald Trump this fall.” THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN O’Malley Dillon joined the Biden campaign last month, assisting in the Nevada effort, where Biden started to turn things around with a distant but second-place finish behind Sanders. She served as the battleground states director on Obama’s 2008 campaign, deputy campaign manager on the president’s 2012 re-election effort and was named as Obama’s first executive director at the Democratic National Committee. “Like so many other Democrats who are unifying behind Joe Biden’s character and leadership, I’m excited to join the team at this critical moment,” O’Malley Dillon said as she spotlighted the tidal wave of support by current and former Democratic federal and state lawmakers the past two weeks as much of the party coalesced around Biden. Should Biden lock up the nomination, he will face the combined efforts of the Trump re-election and the Republican National Committee, which has a massive financial and organizational advantage over Biden’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee.

"                          World Health Organization declares coronavirus a pandemic as spread continues. As the novel coronavirus outbreak has spread around the world and into the United States, governments, private organizations and other institutions have been taking precautions to stymie the spread of the disease. At least 90 major universities are moving to all online classes or closing. Local districts are canceling school. The NBA has put its season on hold. And New York has set up a containment zone with a one-mile radius in New Rochelle, which has been a hotspot for coronavirus cases. In one of the most striking moves to prevent the spread of the coronavirus yet, the NCAA announced Wednesday that it would hold its annual March Madness basketball tournament -- which produces the vast majority of its yearly revenue -- without any fans in attendance. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW The federal government has also taken precautions against the coronavirus. Here are some of the ways the U.S. government has been affected as it takes measures to protect its own employees from the respiratory disease. Capitol closed, tours suspended The White House, the Pentagon and the U.S. Capitol have suspended tours as the number of coronavirus cases in the U.S. continues to increase. While the White House did not mention the coronavirus in its announcement that all tours of the building that serves as both the president's residence and office are temporarily suspended, the House and Senate Sergeants at Arms issued a joint memo informing members that it was shutting down all tours, ""including Member and staff-led tours,"" beginning Thursday evening. NEW ROCHELLE TURNS INTO GHOST TOWN AMID CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK BEFORE NATIONAL GUARD'S ARRIVAL It has also closed the building to all members of the public except ""members, staff and official business visitors."" ""In consultation with the Office of Attending Physician and Leadership, effective at 5:00 p.m. on March 12, 2020, the House and Senate Sergeant at Arms have ordered limited access,"" the memo reads. ""This limited access is anticipated to remain in effect until 8:00 a.m. April 1, 2020, and is to protect the health and safety of Members, staff and visitors."" Closed offices The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) became the first major federal agency earlier this week to ask its staff to telecommute after an employee received treatment for respiratory symptoms. Then, later in the week, multiple members of Congress began closing their D.C. offices, led by Rep. Julia Brownley, D-Calif., and followed shortly thereafter by Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. CORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN ""The Wuhan coronavirus is a grave challenge to our great nation. My first priority is always the safety of our people,"" Cotton said in a statement. ""From the beginning, I have heeded the counsel of Benjamin Franklin: an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement Thursday that he ""fully support[s] the decision of these nonpartisan officers,"" while House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., called on Congress to stay in session until it passes a second coronavirus funding bill that both Republicans and Democrats are comfortable with. There is an upcoming district work period for members next week that may be put on hold while Congress hashes out its difference on coronavirus legislation. Members of Congress in self-quarantine While no members of Congress have tested positive for the coronavirus yet, several members have self-quarantined after they learned that they had been exposed to an infected person. This heavily affected Republican members who attended the CPAC conference two weeks ago, where one person who attended was later revealed to have been infected. TRUMP'S TRAVEL BAN: TRAVELERS IN EUROPE, US EXPERIENCE CONFUSION AT AIRPORTS AMID CORONAVIRUS RESTRICTIONS Among those members who temporarily cut themselves off from interactions with their staffs, colleagues and the public are Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., Rep Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., and Cruz. Gaetz, who had come into contact with President Trump before he found out he had been in contact with the infected person at CPAC, tested negative for the coronavirus. Brownley also self-quarantined after she learned that she'd come into contact with someone who tested positive for the coronavirus. Rep. Louis Gohmert, R-Texas, learned that he'd come into contact with an infected person but was cleared to return to Washington. Incoming Trump chief of staff, Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., also self-quarantined himself earlier this week after learning he came into contact with the infected person at CPAC. News broke Thursday afternoon that Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., also self-quarantined after meeting with a member of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's delegation who later tested positive for the coronavirus. ""The [Brazilian] Embassy said the person had no symptoms leading up to or the day of the conference,"" Scott said in a press release. ""After consulting with the Senate’s attending physician and my personal doctor, I have been told that my risk is low, and I don’t need to take a test or quarantine. However, the health and safety of the American people is my focus and I have made the decision to self-quarantine in an abundance of caution. I am feeling healthy and not experiencing any symptoms at this time."" Staff precautions Before a wave of office closings later in the week, some senior congressional staffers were stressing over how to protect their members from the coronavirus as congressional leaders seemed reluctant to interrupt business as usual in the Capitol Building. Democrats and Republicans are currently hashing out a second spending bill dedicated to fighting the coronavirus. LAWMAKERS MISSING VOTES, CANCELING TRIPS AND TOWN HALLS AS CORONAVIRUS CONCERNS SPREAD An internal memo written by a congressional chief of staff obtained by Fox News Wednesday showed at least one office was taking expansive measures to protect its member, who is a senior citizen. The memo, which redacts the member's name, emphasizes in bold: ""That said — it is absolutely imperative that we limit [redacted]’s’ (and our own) physical contact as much as possible during the coming weeks — no handshakes, no hugs, no kissing, keeping appropriate distance from others, etc. [Redacted] should also not be touching people for photo ops. As staff — we are the first line of defense for [redacted]. That is why I am imploring every staffer who is with [redacted] at events to encourage responsible distancing — for [redacted] protection and yours."" State and DOD travel restrictions Both the Department of Defense and the U.S. State Department are restricting travel for employees in the wake of President Trump's announcement Wednesday night that the U.S. would ban travel from Europe to the United States. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In a Wednesday night press release, the DOD said it will prohibit any travel by service members to ""Level 3"" countries as assigned by the CDC and prevent family members of those in the military and civilian military personnel from traveling to ""Level 2"" countries. It also requires DOD personnel who are returning to the U.S. from ""Level 2"" or ""Level 3"" countries to remain in their homes for 14 days to monitor for any coronavirus symptoms. ""Level 3"" countries include China, Iran, South Korea, Italy and the continent of Europe. There is also a ""Level 3"" restriction to Venezuela, not because of the coronavirus but because of the lack of health infrastructure in the socialist country. On Wednesday night, the CDC also issued a global ""Level 2"" alert due to the worldwide spread of the coronavirus, which on Wednesday was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Reuters also reported Wednesday night that the State Department was suspending all non-essential travel for its staffers, citing anonymous sources.

"                          The coronavirs and its impact on the federal government from school closings to travel restrictions. The Supreme Court is closing its doors to the public indefinitely as concerns over the coronavirus pandemic spread across Washington. Citing “concern for the health and safety of the public and Supreme Court employees,” the public information office for the highest court in the country announced that it would be closing to the public Thursday until further notice. The building, however, will remain for official business and no case filling deadlines will be extended. The news comes shortly after Congress announced it is shutting the Capitol to the public until April in reaction to the spread of the coronavirus. CLICK HERE FOR ALL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE In a statement, the House and Senate sergeants-at-arms said congressional office buildings and the Congressional Visitor Center, through which tourists enter the Capitol, were also being shuttered. In an email to lawmakers' offices, the officials said the Capitol will be closed to all tours, including special ones led by House and Senate members and their aides. No tours will be permitted in the Capitol Visitor Center, a massive three-level underground structure, which opened in 2008 and greeted more than 21 million visitors through 2018. Only lawmakers, staff, journalists and visitors with official business will be permitted to enter the buildings. The closures begin at 5 p.m. EDT Thursday, and the buildings are scheduled to reopen on April 1. The officials said they were acting on the advice of District of Columbia health officials and of Congress' own doctors. President Trump's administration and Congress have struggled over how to react to the virus and COVID-19, the disease it can cause that in some cases can be deadly. Congressional leaders have had to balance conflicting desires of protecting lawmakers and staffs from getting sick with keeping one of the country's most visible public buildings open. White House tours have also been temporarily suspended. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP While comprehensive records about past closures of the Capitol weren't immediately available, the building is seldom closed completely to the public. No visitors were allowed immediately after a 1915 bomb threat against the building. And restrictions were placed on access to the visitors' galleries overlooking the House and the Senate in 1954 after Puerto Rican nationalists fired from the House gallery on lawmakers, wounding five of them. In the fall of 1918, the Capitol was closed briefly to visitors as the Spanish flu spread around the world, killing an estimated tens of millions of people. Around 1,000 people died in the Washington, D.C., region along with at least three members of the House, according to the chamber's historians' office.

"                          Fox News contributor Lawrence Jones says forcing Sen. Bernie Sanders out of the primary race would deprive Joe Biden of one-on-one debate experience and alienate the senator's supporters. Democratic voters will head to the polls Tuesday to vote in the party's first set of primaries after voters have the chance to see the last two remaining contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination -- former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders -- go head-to-head in a debate. Biden has taken control of the race after wins in 10 states on Super Tuesday and at least four states last Tuesday. He now holds a significant delegate lead over Sanders in what became essentially a one-on-one race after billionaire Mike Bloomberg and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren exited the race following Super Tuesday. Sanders admitted the March 10 primaries were not a good night for his campaign while saying he would stay in the race for the Democratic nomination on Wednesday. Tuesday's races, which award 15 percent of all delegates in the Democratic primary and will bring the number of delegates awarded in the Democratic race to 61 percent of the total delegates available, could be Sanders' last stand.       Democratic voters will head to the polls for the first time Tuesday after seeing Sanders and Biden go head-to-head in a debate.       BIDEN HOLDS MASSIVE LEAD OVER SANDERS IN FLORIDA: POLL Here are the states voting and the delegates at stake on Monday, March 17. Arizona There are 67 pledged delegates at stake in Arizona's Democratic presidential primary. The results in Arizona will be an important indicator, as Sanders has typically fared better in western states while Biden has excelled in more diverse states. Arizona, sitting on the U.S. southern border, is both western and diverse. Florida Florida is the biggest prize available on March 17, awarding 219 pledged delegates in all. A diverse swing state, a good performance in Florida will help Sanders or Biden make the case that they are the most electable Democrat to face President Trump in November. Illinois The home state of former President Barack Obama, Illinois will dole out 155 pledged delegates on March 17. Sanders laid some groundwork in Illinois earlier in the primary, visiting the state for three days to Biden's one as of March 11. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Ohio While Ohio only has the third-most delegates of the four states voting in the March 17 primaries, a win in the ever-important general election swing state could help Biden make himself seem even more like the inevitable nominee or help Sanders revive his campaign.

"                          Bill Hemmer breaks down county-by-county results from key Super Tuesday 2.0 states. Joe Biden solidified his hold on the Democratic presidential nomination, winning a pivotal victory in Michigan, which was once seen as a potential source of strength for Bernie Sanders.  Biden also scored a comfortable win in Missouri and a blowout in Mississippi, two states in which he was heavily favored.  The Fox News Voter Analysis surveys, conducted in Michigan, Mississippi, and Missouri, shed light on some of the key trends and dynamics in the Democratic race to take on Donald Trump in the fall. The numbers below may change slightly as more results come in.  BIDEN SURGES TO VICTORY ACROSS SUPER TUESDAY MAP The former vice president’s continuing strength with seniors, black voters, and political moderates propelled him to victory. His campaign’s momentum was particularly apparent among late-deciding voters, who he won by at least 40 percentage points in each state. Importantly for Biden, roughly one-quarter or more voters in each state said they had just recently made up their minds. Biden also significantly outperformed Sanders among suburban voters (winning by at least 20 points in each state) and those living in rural areas (winning by at least 30 points in each state). That included rural whites – a group that Democrats will try to win back in the general election.  Sanders’ base – young and self-identified “very liberal” voters – largely stuck with him, but he was unable to expand his coalition. As a result, more Democrats in each state said they would be satisfied with Biden as the nominee (between 76 percent in Missouri and 86 percent in Mississippi) than would be satisfied with Sanders (between 62 and 67 percent in each state).  Moreover, in an election centered on electability, Democrats felt Biden had a much better shot against Trump than Sanders.  Michigan Sanders’ surprise 2016 win in Michigan gave his campaign a much-needed shot of momentum, but he was unable to repeat the feat this year. Democratic primary voters under age 30 were still a source of strength for the Vermont Senator, but he won just 13 percent of seniors – and more than twice as many seniors turned out as young voters.  Sanders was also able to win “very liberal” Michiganders by 28 points but couldn’t recreate his 2016 performance among working-class whites. Instead, this important group went for Biden by a wide margin.  Biden also won convincingly among women (+28 points), black voters (+36 points), and moderates (+48 points). Michigan will likely be a pivotal swing state in November’s election, and fully eight-in-ten primary voters thought Biden could beat Donald Trump. Far fewer thought Sanders could prevail.  Most Biden voters said they would back the eventual Democratic nominee regardless of who won. Sanders voters were somewhat less certain, with roughly one-quarter saying their vote in November would depend on who won the nomination. Overall, eight-in-ten primary voters said they would definitely back the Democrat against Trump.  One positive sign for the president: almost half of Democratic primary voters in the Wolverine State favored increasing tariffs on goods imported to the U.S., which may suggest Trump’s economic approach will play well with the broader Michigan electorate.  Missouri Nearly half of Missouri Democratic primary voters said health care was the top issue facing the country, a record high in this year’s primary season. Nearly seven-in-ten Show Me State voters favored a Sanders-style single-payer health care system, second only to Iowa (72 percent) among states surveyed as part of the Fox News Voter Analysis to date.  That wasn’t enough for Sanders, however. Almost nine-in-ten voters backed a public option approach to insurance, and voters who said health care was the most important issue facing the country broke for Biden by nearly 20 points.  In the end, Sanders won those looking for a candidate who would fundamentally change the political system by 18 percentage points, voters under age 45 by 25 points, and “very liberal” voters by 30 points.  Biden had much larger advantages with his base, including moderates (+49 points), voters over age 45 (+55 points), and those looking for a candidate who would restore the political system to the way it worked before Trump (+72 points). Mississippi Mississippi was not particularly competitive – which Sanders telegraphed by canceling a planned rally there last week in order to spend more time in Michigan.  The demographics in Mississippi did not do Sanders any favors, as the state had the highest share of black voters and one of the lowest shares of voters under age 30 of any primary surveyed thus far.  Biden won almost every demographic and ideological group, and was particularly dominant among seniors (+55), black voters (+60), and moderates (+58). He even held a narrow edge among self-described “very liberal” voters (+12).  Seven-in-ten Mississippi primary voters identified as moderate or conservative, making it one of the least liberal states to vote thus far. That showed in Democratic primary voters’ views on social policies: a record-high 30 percent opposed legalizing marijuana, while almost half opposed legalizing abortion under any circumstances.  Methodology The Fox News Voter Analysis, conducted in partnership with the Associated Press, provides a comprehensive look at voting behavior, opinions and preferences as America votes. Surveys for the March 10th primary states were conducted in Michigan, Mississippi, and Missouri. The surveys were conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago the week before the primaries, concluding as polls closed. Interviews were conducted in English or Spanish. The survey is based on interviews with a random sample of registered voters drawn from the state voter file. In Michigan, these probability sample results were supplemented by interviews with self-identified registered voters recruited from nonprobability online panels. The sample sizes and margins of sampling error were 2,446 in Michigan (plus or minus 3.3 percentage points), 1,065 in Mississippi (plus or minus 4.9 percentage points), and 1,881 in Missouri (plus or minus 3.5 percentage points).

"                          Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden says the coronavirus pandemic does not have a political affiliation, requires a national response. Former Vice President Joe Biden on Thursday unveiled a plan to combat and overcome the coronavirus. Biden – the clear front-runner in the Democratic presidential nomination race over Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont – also criticized President Trump's efforts to date to curb the spread of the virus, or COVID-19, in the United States. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE CORONAVIRIUS OUTBREAK “Downplaying it, being overly dismissive, or spreading misinformation is only going to hurt us and further advantage the spread of the disease. But neither should we panic or fall back on xenophobia,” Biden said in a speech from his hometown of Wilmington, Del. “Labeling COVID-19 a foreign virus does not displace accountability for the misjudgments that have been taken thus far by the Trump administration,” Biden said as he took aim at the president for calling the pandemic a “foreign virus” in an Oval Office address Wednesday night that’s been criticized for a number of misstatements. Biden called for “decisive public health response to curb the spread of the disease and to provide treatment to those who need it.” He said his plan would ensure the wide availability of free testing, the elimination of all cost barriers for treatment and preventive care for COVID-19, the development of a vaccine and the deployment of supplies and personnel. The former vice president also called for the “decisive economic response to deliver real relief to American works, families, and small businesses that protects the economy.” Biden’s plan includes emergency paid leave for all those affected by the outbreak, including assistance to workers, families and small businesses that are hit hard by the economic upheaval.  Biden said that his plan is a “roadmap not for what I will do as president 10 months from now but for the leadership that I believe that is needed and required at this very moment.” And needling his likely opponent in November’s election, Biden said that “President Trump is welcome to adopt all of it.” THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN  Biden charged that “protecting the health and safety of the American people is the most important job of any president. Unfortunately, this virus laid bare the severe shortcomings of the current administration. Public fears are being compounded by pervasive lack of trust in this president, fueled by an adversarial relationship with truth that he continues to have. Our government’s ability to respond effectively has been undermined by hollowing out our agencies and disparagement of science.” Moments after the conclusion of Biden’s speech, the Trump re-election campaign returned fire, arguing that in the past Biden’s “shown terrible judgment and incompetence in the face of public health issues.” “The Obama White House had to publicly apologize for and clean up after Biden when his irresponsible remarks caused panic during the swine flu outbreak in 2009. Just weeks ago, he was openly critical of President Trump’s early move to restrict travel from China to the United States in response to the coronavirus – a decision which medical experts agree helped impede the spread of the virus to this country,” charged Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh. Biden’s campaign had announced on Wednesday that the former vice president would give the address Thursday afternoon on the coronavirus. The Sanders campaign announced just before Biden came before cameras that the senator would make his own address regarding the pandemic from his hometown of Burlington, Vt., later in the afternoon.

Sign up here.**On the roster: Coronanxiety nugget edition - I’ll Tell You What: Never tweet (for one week) - Biden shakes up campaign team - Florida cowCORONANXIETY NUGGET EDITIONAs Americans fret over whether they are too anxious about coronavirus or not anxious enough – coronanxiety anxiety – let’s keep it a little light today so you have plenty of time to Google “bulk Purell” and spray down flat surfaces.- The Democrats debate travails this cycle would be funny if they weren’t so sad, so it probably makes sense that they would end up with a figurative case of coronavirus. First, the debate scheduled for Sunday in Arizona was going forward, but with no audience. Then, for part of today, it seemed that it was going to be cancelled. That would have been great news for the party and frontrunner/almost-presumptive-nominee Joe Biden, who is not exactly the modern William F. Buckley of televised debate. But it would have been bad for host CNN and, most of all, second-place Bernie Sanders. Sanders all but promised Wednesday to bow out of the race after one more chance to damage Biden and the party’s chances in a final debate. So the debate will go on… sort of. CNN will host the two men in its Washington studios Sunday night so Sanders can get his last digs in.- One question looming over next week is how the virus response will affect the scheduled primaries in Florida, Illinois, Ohio and Arizona. It’s already changing the way state officials are conducting things and will obviously have major consequences for voter turnout. Will Bernie Sanders do better with his intense supporters having an outsized influence in smaller electorates? Will Joe Biden benefit from his seeming advantage among early voters so far this year? Like much of this crisis, we’ll only know when we get there.  - The Senate is cancelling its scheduled spring break recess in order to at least appear busy while their constituents are grappling with amateur epidemiology. Real action on a legislative response comes down to the administration cutting a deal with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. We’re sure there’ll be no problems there… lolz- The Capitol will be closed indefinitely to tours, which really is a shame. This is the time of year when busloads of students flood the city on class trips. As much as we hate the traffic, we love seeing young people learning about the republic. - Folks at the White House are dealing with the fact that President Trump was almost certainly exposed last weekend to coronavirus courtesy of an aide to Brazilian strongman Jair Bolsonaro on his visit to Trump’s Florida country club. (The aide who tested positive, Fabio Wajngarten, is a first-ballot inductee into the Halftime Report Name Hall of Fame. We may adopt it for our online alias.) With other world leaders stepping back from public events, there will be growing pressure on Trump to do the same. Whatever Trump opts to do, his aides have to be thinking about what the president’s Twitter feed would look like…- Speaking of things you shouldn’t say from quarantine, Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican congressman and honorary Trump who was among the many exposed to the virus at the Conservative Political Action Convention last month, is partly filling his time in isolation with interviews. In his talk with The Spectator, Gaetz described his feeling upon finding out while aboard Air Force One that he had posed for a picture with the ill man: “And that really concerned me because in the picture I was holding the guy’s phone. I might as well have licked his toilet seat.” We don’t know how they take pictures down in Pensacola, but it sounds pretty intense.- President Trump is a golfer, so this analogy may be apt: Oval Office speeches are like hitting a one iron on an approach shot. If you nail it, it’s highly effective and looks majestic. There’s nothing quite like it. But if you miss – and most of us miss – you just make a bad shot go farther. Trump was right to resist giving his Wednesday night address. We were reminded very much of then-President Obama’s first Oval Office address in June of 2010 about a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Obama muffed that shot for sure. It’s just a very challenging medium. Only the very, very best are able to pull it off. Others ought to lay up whenever possible.- Whatever you thought of Trump’s pained delivery, Noah Rothman observes that it was the factual errors that are the real problem: “Either the president misspoke, the prepared text of his national address was irredeemably sloppy, or the White House has not been coordinating closely with the health-insurance industry ahead of the address. Whatever the explanation, it isn’t acceptable.” It’s always unfortunate when leaders blame staff work, but what the heck is going on at the White House?- Can the government really restrict your freedom of movement during a quarantine without due process? While you’ve been out hoarding Charmin and getting your pets fitted for masks, Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano has been pondering the constitutional questions. The Judge explains how in the coronavirus response, the Constitution restricts mandatory government quarantines: “The issue of whether government in America can quarantine persons against their will, ostensibly for their own health and that of others with whom they may come in contact, requires a dual analysis – one of the powers of the federal government and the other of the powers of the states.” More here.- Shout out to 17-year-old Avi Schiffmann. The Seattle-area student at Bellevue College developed the website that has become a global sensation for people trying to track the spread of coronavirus. He began his project in December because there was so much misinformation and so few resources. He told the Mercer Island Reporter his thought when he was frustrated with what was available: “Well, I can do better than the government.”- One youth who could learn a lesson from Schiffman about good entrepreneurship is the student at Dixons Unity Academy in Leeds, England who was sent home after it was discovered that the teen was selling squirts of hand sanitizer for the equivalent of 64 cents a pop.  THE RULEBOOK: FROM THE BOTTOM UP“It has been shown in the course of these papers, that the existing Confederation is founded on principles which are fallacious; that we must consequently change this first foundation, and with it the superstructure resting upon it.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 37TIME OUT: THAT’S WHY THIS SNAIL IS A TRAMPNatGeo: “If you think Daylight Saving Time is the biggest drag on your morning alertness, you may want to consider coffee leaf rust. Coffee leaf rust is the most economically significant coffee pest in the world. Since the 1980s, occasional outbreaks of this fungus have crippled coffee production in the Americas, at times doubling or tripling its price. And the problem has escalated since 2008, as have the massive resources invested in fighting it. A new discovery raises an intriguing possibility for controlling coffee’s costliest pest, and it comes packed inside a small shell. According to recent research from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, Asian tramp snails, Bradybaena similaris, can consume large amounts of coffee rust before the disease can damage the plant. Leave one snail on a rust-covered leaf, and it can hoover up 30 percent of the fungus in 24 hours.”Flag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARDESTIMATED DELEGATES FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATIONBiden: 864Sanders: 710[Ed. note: 1,991 delegates needed to win]TRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE Average approval: 44.2 percentAverage disapproval: 52.6 percentNet Score: 8.4 percentChange from one week ago: ↓ 2.2 points[Average includes: Quinnipiac University: 41% approve - 54% disapprove; CNN: 45% approve - 52% disapprove; Fox News: 47% approve - 52% disapprove; IBD: 41% approve - 54% disapprove; Gallup: 47% approve - 51% disapprove.]WANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT? You can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

The move is intended to quell concerns raised in recent weeks by senior Democratic strategists about the leadership structure of the Biden campaign, which has been beset by underwhelming fundraising, scant staffing resources and organizational miscues during the early nominating contests. The campaign shuffle is an acknowledgment that while Biden has had a remarkable recent run of victories — at least 15 of the past 21 contests — his operation was not up to the challenge posed by President Trump if Biden wins the nomination. After Biden performed well below expectations in the Iowa caucuses, Anita Dunn, a senior adviser who previously worked for President Barack Obama, took operational control of the campaign, sharing responsibilities with Biden’s original campaign manager, Greg Schultz.”Biden campaign shares path-to-victory memo - Fox News: “An internal memo from the campaign of former Vice President Joe Biden said it's ‘nearing impossible’ for Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., to regain the lead in delegates after losses in several of the Democrats' presidential primary contests. The memo said the campaign netted 160 delegates, including up to 80 won on Tuesday. Biden campaign officials said they expected his lead to expand in ‘some of our strongest’ states -- Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Ohio and Georgia. ‘Of 682 delegates awarded in those states, conservative estimates have us winning more than 400 delegates and netting more than 150 delegates,’ the memo read. The officials said wins for Sanders in Vermont, Colorado and Utah haven't collected him enough delegates to be able to compete. ‘It's not just that Sanders has failed to win a large number of states, it's also that these wins have not netted significant delegates for him in the way they have for us,’ the memo read.”Dems continue to pressure Sanders out - Bloomberg: “Democrats are pressuring Bernie Sanders to drop out of the presidential race in order to unify the progressive and moderate wings of the party against their common foe: Donald Trump. After a series of wins on Tuesday extended Joe Biden’s delegate lead to an all-but-insurmountable level, Democratic leaders began publicly calling on Sanders to end his campaign, fearing a prolonged fight could splinter the party and give Trump another term in office. But Sanders and some allies are having none of it. He agreed on Wednesday that defeating Trump was the party’s ultimate goal, but said he remained convinced he was the candidate to do it. He insisted that voters supported his progressive agenda, even though they were choosing Biden for ‘electability’ reasons. ‘Today I say to the Democratic establishment, in order to win in the future, you need to win the voters who represent the future of our country and you must speak to the issues of concern to them,’ he told reporters.Bloomberg reports $275 million spent on anti-Trump ads - WSJ: “Michael Bloomberg’s presidential campaign spent $275 million just on advertising attacking President Trump, according the campaign. The former New York City mayor, who entirely self-funded his campaign before dropping out last week, invested about $225 million on 31 different anti-Trump TV ads, according to his team. Of that amount, more than $175 million was spent on local markets, including in general-election swing states, and $45 million on national buys.”AUDIBLE: CASHED OUT“The conventional wisdom about money’s role in American politics is overblown.

"                          Dr. William Schaffner, professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, joins ‘The Daily Briefing.’ President Tweeted out a series of charts on Thursday explaining safety precautions Americans can take to avoid becoming infected by the coronavirus. The charts, which include tips for home, work, school and other locations, advise people to wash their hands thoroughly, adjust any unnecessary travel or plans, and avoid going to work or school if you feel sick. The tweets come a day after Trump announced the suspension of travel between European countries and the United States for 30 days as the fast-spreading coronavirus pandemic continues to grow. The travel measure will go into effect at midnight Friday, Trump said during a nationally televised message from the White House on Wednesday. He said the ""strong but necessary"" restrictions would not apply to the United Kingdom. As the coronavirus continues to spread worldwide, the U.S. and many other nations have enacted tough measures to contain the illness, including barring foreign visitors from countries ravaged by the outbreak. ""I'm confident that by counting and continuing to take these tough measures we will significantly reduce the threat to our citizens and we'll ultimately and expeditiously defeat this virus,"" Trump said.  The Trump administration so far has barred travelers from mainland China, where the virus originated last December, and Iran, which also has seen a spike in infections, from entering the United States.  The restrictions covered any foreign nationals who visited those countries within the past 14 days. The virus has killed over 4,200 people and sickened nearly 120,000 others globally. Some 1,200 cases have been reported in the U.S. CLICK HERE FOR FOX NEWS' COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE In addition to travel restrictions, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned Americans to avoid all nonessential travel to multiple countries, including Italy, which largely has been in a lockdown state amid a surge in coronavirus infections. Other nations included South Korea, China and Iran. The agency also has warned Americans to take extra precautions when traveling to Japan. Fox News Louis Casiano contributed to this report.

"                          The coronavirs and its impact on the federal government from school closings to travel restrictions. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday gave a stark assessment of the coronavirus pandemic, calling it the “worst public health crisis for a generation” and telling British families that many are going to lose loved ones because of the virus. “This is the worst public crisis for a generation, some people compare it to seasonal flu, alas that is not right,"" he said. ""Owing to the lack of immunity, this disease is more dangerous and it’s going to spread further."" TRUMP SHRUGS OFF EU ANGER ABOUT CORONAVIRUS TRAVEL BAN: 'WHEN THEY RAISE TAXES ON US, THEY DON'T CONSULT US' ""I must level with the British public, many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time,” he added. Johnson addressed reporters after holding an emergency COBRA meeting of top Cabinet officials to discuss the growing global pandemic. The prime minister held off from certain measures that other European countries had taken, such as banning large public gatherings and shutting down schools, but said that the government was advising anyone with a fever or persistent cough to stay at home for a week. He said the government may soon recommend that entire households self-isolate, but that it was not issuing that advice at this time.

(Simon Dawson/Pool via AP) On closing schools, he said that the scientific advice was “this could do more harm than good at this time.” His remarks come hours after Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar announced that all schools, universities and other public facilities will be closed and teaching will be done online or remotely. IRELAND ANNOUNCES SWEEPING MEASURES TO COMBAT CORONAVIRUS, SCHOOLS TO CLOSE FOR TWO WEEKS “We have not witnessed a pandemic of this nature in living memory and this is uncharted territory for us,” Varadkar said from Washington, D.C. While Britain has so far been spared the kind of significant spread that other countries such as Italy have suffered, the country has 590 confirmed cases and at least 10 deaths. But Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, said the number of infected could rise to 10,000. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW Vallance also said that the government believes that the peak might be 10 to 14 weeks away. About 95 percent who will be infected could be struck over a nine to 10-week period on either side of that peak. The officials showed a graph showing the predicted peak, with a sharp increase and decline on either side of it. Johnson made reference to that graph when he urged Brits with symptoms to self-isolate, saying it would “help us delay and flatten the peak, squash that sombrero.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Britain was given a boost on Wednesday night when President Trump announced a European travel ban but excluded both the U.K. and Ireland from the restrictions. “The U.K. basically has got the border, strong borders and they're doing a very good, job, they don't have much infections and hopefully they'll keep it that way,” he said. Johnson is a close ally of Trump, who has in turn supported Johnson's push to take Britain out of the European Union. Fox News' Chris Irvine and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

"                          Coronavirus concerns lead DNC to change location of first head-to-head debate between Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden; Peter Doocy reports from Wilmington, Delaware. Election officials across the country are moving to make last-minute changes to how and where voters will cast their ballots in the remaining primary elections as the U.S. grapples with the widening coronavirus outbreak. The states voting in next Tuesday’s primary – Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio – are all taking extra precautions to protect both voters and poll workers from COVID-19, including moving polling locations, recruiting reserve poll workers and encouraging populations most at risk from the virus to vote early or send in an absentee ballot.  Maybe nowhere is taking the precautions more seriously than in Florida, where residents – including the state’s more than 4.3 million people over the age of 65, or about 20 percent of the state’s population – will head to the polls next Tuesday. The elderly and those with underlying health conditions are most at risk of developing serious complications if they contract the coronavirus. CLICK HERE FOR ALL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has stated that nursing homes are at the highest risk of being affected by the virus – given the age of residents and the close quarters in which people live – but nursing homes are also popular locations for polling sites.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called the use of nursing homes as polling sites “problematic” during a news conference on Wednesday and suggested that if a polling site is at one of these facilities, only residents should be able to vote there. In Pinellas County – home to Tampa Bay and St. Petersburg – election officials said they will be rerouting voters slated to cast a ballot at a nursing home to the next closest polling place.  Another issue facing election officials in the Sunshine State is a dearth of poll workers as fears grow of contracting the coronavirus.  During the last presidential election, 56 percent of poll workers in the country were 61 years old or older, according to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, and Florida officials say workers are dropping out in huge numbers.  In Florida’s Pasco County, supervisor of elections Brian Corley told the Tampa Bay Times that he is “hemorrhaging” workers, after 30 people dropped out due to fears of the coronavirus. Corley is now asking the county’s sheriff’s office for employees to fill the void and wants DeSantis to open large, centralized voting centers if they can’t wrangle up enough volunteers. MIAMI-DADE DECLARES STATE OF EMERGENCY AMID CORONAVIRUS, SUSPENDS ALL MAJOR EVENTS “You have to think of every possible scenario of what you can do and how you could pivot,” Corley said. On the opposite side of the state, elections officials in Palm Beach County last month recruited around 300 extra poll workers in preparation for concerns over the virus – a prudent move as 325 workers had canceled as of Tuesday. Nearby Broward County has more than 4,000 poll workers for 577 precincts at 421 locations, and officials there say they are confident they will have enough people manning the polls to pull off next Tuesday’s primary.  “We have recruited and have backups for far more poll workers than we need at this point in time,” Broward Supervisor of Elections Pete Antonacci told the Florida Sun-Sentinel. “To date we have not had any issues ensuring adequate staffing.” Both counties are also shifting polling sites away from nursing homes and beefing up supplies of hand sanitizer, wipes, soap, alcohol and paper towels at sites.  The other states voting next Tuesday are also taking precautions to prevent the further spread of the coronavirus at polling sites.  In Arizona – whose 1.2 million seniors make up over 17 percent of the state’s population – polling sites are being moved away from nursing homes to churches, libraries and American Legion headquarters. Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs also announced on Thursday that the state will allow curbside voting and is encouraging people to vote early. The state will also be thoroughly cleaning each polling site throughout the day.  WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION OFFICIAL: 80 PERCENT OF CORONAVIRUS CASES WILL INVOLVE MILD SYMPTOMS “We are encouraging these additional precautions for certain voting locations,” Hobbs said in a statement. “We also want to remind voters to make a plan for participating in this election.” The Democratic National Committee announced Thursday that it was moving Sunday's presidential debate from Arizona to Washington, D.C. because of concerns about coronavirus. The party had already announced that the debate between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders would be held without a live audience. Now the location is changing due to concerns about cross-country travel. In addition, Univision anchor Jorge Ramos no longer will moderate the debate because he was in proximity to a person who was in direct contact with another individual who tested positive for the virus. The DNC says Ramos is not symptomatic. Ohio elections officials are also shifting polling sites away from nursing homes and permitting curbside voting as well as encouraging any poll workers who feel ill to avoid coming in to work. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP ""While we certainly don’t want poll workers to participate if they aren’t feeling well, we are working with our county boards to ensure a healthy voting environment,"" Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose said in a press conference. In Illinois, elections officials in Chicago were mulling over a clause in the Illinois Constitution mandating that elections are “free and equal” amid arguments that the coronavirus outbreak prevented a “free and equal” election.  State law, however, does not explicitly allow for elections to be postponed and officials in the Windy City told the Chicago Sun-Times there is “no chance” the city will delay the election. Much like the other states voting on Tuesday, Illinois is also moving polling locations away from nursing homes and advising people to mail in ballots whenever possible.

This comes as Republicans are opposing House Democrats' proposed legislation, which McConnell had described as an ""ideological wish list.""

A senior Senate Republican aide said that senators will be departing for the weekend but will be back to address the House bill Monday, despite originally scheduled to have next week off. ""We’ll take a look at anything they send us,"" McConnell said. The Democrats' bill, unveiled late Wednesday, provides for paid sick leave, free coronavirus testing and funding for states to address economic hardships imposed by the coronavirus. McCarthy had opposed it due to the lack of exemptions or sunsets for the paid sick leave, as well as the time it would take to set up the sick leave program. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she and her fellow Democrats are open to making changes to their bill and are still discussing the issues with the Trump administration.

"                          The National Coalition for Men is challenging the Selective Service System in court, arguing that women should be part of the draft. As America gears up for possible military confrontations in the Middle East and South China Sea, the Trump Administration is considering doing away with the country's all-male draft system.   Back in 1981, the Supreme Court ruled the male-only draft is constitutional, and it's been in place ever since. Every year, millions of American men turn 18 and fill out their Selective Service card; it's become something of a rite of passage.  But women are playing a greater role in today's military, including serving in combat units since 2015. Now the National Coalition for Men is challenging the Selective Service System in court, arguing that the previous ruling is out of date and discriminatory, and women should be part of the draft. The move comes as the Trump Administration has been looking for new ways to get Americans excited about careers in the military, but in a booming economy, it hasn't been easy. Army Secretary Ryan Mccarthy recently told Fox's Bret Baier that ""recruiting's been a challenge. Three-point-six percent unemployment, so, there are no benchmarks. We're kind of in uncharted territory."" Arguing for the government, the Justice Department is opposing any changes to Selective Service at this time, saying only Congress has the power to regulate the draft, not the courts. They also say this isn't the right time to shake up a system that's been in place for decades. But that argument might be changing soon. The White House has convened a Federal Commission to look into the issue to see if it's appropriate to include women in a future draft situation. They haven't released their report yet, but people we spoke to were overwhelmingly in favor of including women in the draft.  Most called it an issue of equality.   Still, there were others who said women should be allowed to volunteer for the military, but not be subject to the draft. It's a debate that will likely continue until the Commission releases its final recommendations at the end of March.      ",         Trump administration considering doing away with America's male-only draft system,         2020-03-12T134927-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/trump-administration-considering-doing-away-with-americas-male-only-draft-system,Fox
"                          Fox News contributor Lawrence Jones says forcing Sen. Bernie Sanders out of the primary race would deprive Joe Biden of one-on-one debate experience and alienate the senator's supporters. The Democratic National Committee has moved Sunday’s planned Democratic presidential debate from Phoenix, Ariz., to a studio in Washington, D.C., where former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders will debate without a live audience, amid coronavirus fears. “Out of an abundance of caution and in order to reduce cross-country travel, all parties have decided that the best path forward is to hold Sunday’s debate at CNN’s studio in Washington, D.C., with no live audience,” DNC Communications Director Xochitl Hinojosa said in a statement Thursday. She also announced that moderator Jorge Ramos will step back from this debate due to contact with someone who was in contact with someone else who tested positive. NO LIVE AUDIENCE AT NEXT DEM DEBATE AMID CORONAVIRUS  “In addition, the DNC, CNN and Univision recently learned that Univision anchor and moderator Jorge Ramos was in proximity with someone who was in direct contact with a person that tested positive for coronavirus,” she continued. “Both Mr. Ramos and the person he was in contact with are in good health and symptom-free. Despite being cleared by medical professionals and out of an abundance of caution, Jorge has decided to step aside from participating in the upcoming March 15 democratic debate. Univision’s News Anchor Ilia Calderón will moderate the debate in his place.” She added: “Our number one priority has and will continue to be the safety of our staff, campaigns and all those involved in the debate.” The DNC on Wednesday had announced that the debate would take place, as scheduled, in Arizona, but without a live audience “at the request of both campaigns and out of an abundance of caution.” The decision to move the event to D.C. comes a day after the World Health Organization designated the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, an international pandemic. President Trump on Wednesday night, in an address to the nation from the Oval Office, said he was calling for a temporary halt on air travel to the United States from Europe, excluding flights from the United Kingdom and those carrying cargo, in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. ""The virus will not have a chance against us. No nation is more prepared, or more resilient,"" Trump said. The outbreak is believed to have originated at an animal and seafood market in the city of Wuhan, China. As of Thursday morning, there were more than 1,300 cases of coronavirus in the United States, in 44 states, including Washington, D.C. The U.S. has, so far, seen 36 coronavirus-related deaths. US CAPITOL CLOSED TO GENERAL PUBLIC AMID CORONAVIRUS CONCERNS For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus.

"                          An inside look into President Trump’s immigration tent court system. The Trump administration established the ""Remain in Mexico"" policy in January 2019 -- a policy that has become one of the central pieces of the administration’s push to combat the ongoing crisis at the southern border. The policy, formally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, involves migrants who arrive at the southern border and claim asylum. They are returned to Mexico to await their hearings instead of being allowed into the United States. INSIDE TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION TENT COURTS: CONTROVERSIAL SYSTEM MEANT TO FAST-TRACK ASYLUM BACKLOG  The policy has seen tent courtrooms set up in places such as Laredo and Brownsville, Texas, where migrants could have their cases processed as the policy was expanded in the summer amid greater cooperation with Mexico. By doing so, administration officials say it has helped end the practice of “catch-and-release” and also helped end a pull factor that was drawing migrants north. Officials say it dramatically reduces processing times as well, getting cases through in a matter of months rather than years. “The importance of MPP can’t be stated enough. It is what’s allowed us to take control of the crisis that we saw in April and May. The idea is to make sure we process individuals in a timely manner but make sure they wait south of the border,” Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf said. SUPREME COURT GIVES TRUMP WIN BY ALLOWING 'REMAIN IN MEXICO' POLICY TO CONTINUE But opponents say that it sends migrants into dangerous areas in Mexico, where they are at risk of violence and kidnapping. Top Democratic presidential candidates have promised to end the policy if elected into office. The group Human Rights First has called the courts ""secretive"" and described them as part of an ""attack"" on due process within a ""sham"" asylum system. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals recently blocked the policy, but suspended its ruling until the Supreme Court could weigh in. The 9th Circuit panel accepted the claim that ""non-Mexicans returned to Mexico under the MPP risk substantial harm, even death, while they await adjudication of their applications for asylum."" The Supreme Court handed the administration a significant victory when it said it would allow the administration to enforce the policy as litigation continues. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The expansion of MPP has coincided with dramatic results at the border – including a more than 70 percent decrease in apprehensions since the highs of May last year. It has been combined with a series of regional agreements on migration with countries south of the border. Approximately 60,000 people have been returned to Mexico since the policy was introduced. DHS estimates suggest a significant number of those eventually gave up their cases and returned home.

"                          Former Vice President Joe Biden swept to victory in Michigan's pivotal primary contest Tuesday, capturing four more states; Biden deputy campaign manager and communications director Kate Bedingfield discusses Biden's biggest challenge as campaign rolls on. I’ll be brief. In the spirit of Joe Biden now giving seven-minute speeches—the better to limit possible gaffes—I will be as terse as possible in assessing the Democratic race. I won’t say it’s over. The reason is that too many people in my profession declared Biden a dead man walking in what now looks like a spectacular failure of judgment. And the entire media and political establishment said there was no flippin’ way that Donald Trump was going to beat Hillary Clinton. But do I see much daylight for a possible Bernie comeback? As hard as I might squint, it’s very difficult. JOURNALISTS FEAR CONTRACTING VIRUS AS COVERAGE INCREASINGLY CRITICIZED When Biden routed Sanders in Michigan, where the democratic socialist had made a last stand of sorts, it was clear he was headed for another big night of Super Tuesday proportions. He clobbered Sanders in Missouri and Mississippi. He even won Idaho. And while Biden lost North Dakota, the fact that he’s trailing by a fraction of a percent in Washington state is a remarkable comeback by itself. And Biden replicated his stunning coalition of blacks, working-class whites, women, suburbanites and older voters, losing only younger people excited by Bernie’s sweeping and costly agenda. So when Sanders called in the media yesterday afternoon, there was understandable speculation that he might be dropping out. He admitted that he is losing the delegate race as well as the electability argument, but said he’d fight on, starting with Sunday’s CNN debate. And he took no questions. The problem for Bernie is that he’s fighting on unfavorable turf—he’ll most likely get pounded next week in Florida and Georgia—which makes it even more difficult to close the gap in delegates. The Washington Post headline on Dan Balz’s analysis: “Biden Appears to be on an unstoppable march to the nomination.” The always measured Balz writes that “barring something unforeseen, Democrats now know that former vice president Joe Biden will be the party’s nominee to challenge President Trump in November…there is little to give Sanders any confidence that he can reverse the trends enough to overtake the surging Biden.” SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES Politico is even more definitive: “In every way other than mathematically, his presidential campaign is done.” The piece says that for the first time the Sanders camp has no excuse, since Elizabeth Warren dropped out and he got the two-man contest he’s long wanted. The New York Times says this of Biden’s “dominant position”: “So thorough is Mr. Biden’s hold on the party now that any collapse would probably require a political U-turn as sharp as the one that precipitated his rise.” And the Atlantic headline on Ron Brownstein’s piece simply says, “It’s Over.” I did get the impression from Bernie’s tone yesterday that he’s playing out the string. As a veteran politician, he must know he faces Mission Impossible and is trying to extend his time in the spotlight to argue for his ideas. And Biden faces his own set of pressures, to win over Bernie supporters for the fall campaign. One last point—I know, I’m almost done—comes from Times conservative columnist Ross Douthat. He says the coronavirus boosted Joe, that with this burgeoning crisis there is “a flight to safety, the surrender of grand plans and big ambitions in favor of a desire to just survive. Michigan voted for Biden overwhelmingly for the same reason that both Biden and Sanders canceled rallies just before the vote — because this is now the coronavirus election, against whose stark existential stakes all normal political battles must give way.” I think there’s something to that. A crisis like what the WHO now calls a pandemic leads people to want to play it safe, and whether the criticism of President Trump is warranted or not, they find a former vice president more reassuring than a maverick preaching revolution. Okay, I’m done. Thank you all for coming.

"                          President Trump and White House officials are discussing how to stimulate the economy after stocks make a record one-day drop; John Roberts reports. It was inevitable that the media, which have been covering the coronavirus round the clock, would soon be affected by the virus as well. The Washington Post has asked reporters who covered CPAC to self-quarantine for seven days, since someone at the conservative conference was infected with the virus. Politico and the Daily Beast have asked its reporters who covered the gathering in suburban Maryland to work remotely, according to Washingtonian. (Several members of Congress are self-quarantining after attending CPAC, and that includes Mark Meadows, President Trump’s incoming chief of staff.) Katie Couric tweeted that she had been with Rick Cotton, head of the New York and New Jersey Port Authority, over the weekend, and wished him well after he had contracted the virus. Many people demanded to know why she hadn’t immediately self-quarantined. Couric said she’d only had a 90-second conversation with no physical contact, and her doctor and health officials said there was no need for a quarantine, but that she would be cautious and work from home. MEDIA LAUNCH VEEPSTAKES CHATTER: BIDEN NEEDS A WOMAN, BUT WHICH ONE? This is probably just the beginning. If members of Congress are at risk, Capitol Hill reporters might also be exposed to the virus. And many outside guests pass through television studios, and are touched by makeup artists. In one sign of the times, the press seats in the Pentagon briefing room have been spread out in a bow to social distancing. On the entertainment side of the business, TMZ reports that “Jeopardy!” and “Wheel of Fortune” have decided to tape their shows without a live studio audience. One reported concern is the weakened immune system of “Jeopardy!” host Alex Trebek, who is battling Stage 4 cancer. It’s hard to be in journalism without personal contact with people–whether it’s covering rallies or debates, flying on Air Force One, or getting out and interviewing people--but we all need to rethink our daily routines. And what about the party conventions in July and August? Will they come off as planned if the virus is spreading at anything like the rate it is today? Will many of the 15,000 journalists who generally attend decide to pass up Milwaukee and Charlotte? There are more subtle effects as well. It’s one thing to be reporting and writing about coronavirus in China, Italy, or the Seattle suburbs. It’s another thing when people you actually know are contracting the virus, and adds to the sense that the disease is dangerously spreading. And this comes at a time when the news business is under fire—by critics ranging from Trump to Dr. Drew—for unnecessarily scaring people about the magnitude of the threat. (The press, in turn, regularly lambastes Trump for underplaying the situation.) Some bomb-throwers like CNBC commentator Rick Santelli aren’t helping. He called for everyone in America to be infected with the virus to get it over with. “It was just a stupid thing to say,” he later admitted on “Squawk Box.” “The idea of something so absurd — I just apologize, and I apologize to everyone on this segment and all my peers at CNBC. We will get through this. We are resilient. But even if one life is affected, I do apologize for my insensitivity.”  SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham is demanding that Vanity Fair retract a report that Trump has told aides he’s afraid that journalists will try to contract the coronavirus and give it to him on Air Force One. “False and sensational writing on this topic is irresponsible,” she said. The broader dilemma, in my view, is not so much the tone of the coverage as the relentless volume of it. There are so many angles to this global story, including the stock market plunge that culminated Monday with the largest drop since the 2008 financial crisis. Harvard kicks students out of the dorms and moves to online classes. Boston cancels its St. Patrick’s Day parade. South by Southwest is canceled. Pearl Jam cancels its concerts. Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders camce; rallies in Cleveland. New York and Florida declare states of emergency. Andrew Cuomo deploys the National Guard to a “containment zone” in a New York City suburb. There is talk of the NCAA tournament, and even the NBA, playing without fans (which LeBron James says he would boycott). And every new case, or handful of cases, gets breaking-news treatment. These and many other stories are significant and have to be covered. What’s more, there is clearly a huge public appetite for news about the virus (not to mention a thriving market of disinformation on social media, as the NYT reports). That’s why the subject is dominating cable news and the top of home pages of major newspapers. In that sense, news executives can be described as giving the public what it wants. But with America on edge, with emotions so raw, with the crisis so politicized, journalists need to think long and hard about whether their they are even inadvertently sowing the seeds of panic.

As she told Democratic members that the House of Representatives was close to a ""bipartisan agreement"" on a second bill to fight the coronavirus pandemic, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., also telegraphed overnight that the chamber would begin work on a third coronavirus-related spending measure. The move came after the worst day on the stock market since 1987, with stocks plunging 10 percent and after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell canceled his chamber's recess scheduled for next week. Pelosi has not indicated whether the House of Representatives will do the same. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ""Time is of the essence, and this bill must be passed and sent to the Senate,"" a Thursday night Dear Colleague letter from Pelosi to House Democrats read. ""The House will then get to work on a third emergency response package that will take further effective action that protects the health, economic security and well-being of the American people."" HOUSE BILL THAT WOULD PROVIDE CORONAVIRUS SICK LEAVE, FREE TESTS IN FLUX Friday morning, major futures indexes showed gains of 3.5 percent, potentially on hopes of a second piece of legislation dedicated to fighting the novel coronavirus and shielding the economy from its effects. That increase indicates that investors may be calming down for now after an anxiety-filled week that culminated in Thursday's rapid-fire headlines of closures, cancellations and shutdowns of schools, sporting events, government agencies and even Disneyland. It's unclear what would be in a third coronavirus bill from the House, though there was significant disagreement between Republicans and Democrats over the details of the second one. Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin negotiated throughout Thursday to tweak the second coronavirus bill and reach a compromise the president could sign. Pelosi expressed a sense of urgency to pass legislation to help families in need with the scheduled recess looming. McConnell slammed Pelosi's initial proposal as an ""ideological wish list."" Trump had wanted a payroll tax cut that Pelosi didn't include. Republicans also raised concerns about the expansiveness of new paid sick leave programs and not including language to ban federal funds for abortion.

"                          Rep. Michael C. Burgess, who is also a physician, says Congress needs to work together now more than ever. A Democratic congresswoman secured a commitment for free coronavirus testing from the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday after she peppered him with questions about the importance of testing and the cost of treatment. ‘""Dr. Kadlec, for someone without insurance, do you know the out-of-pocket cost of a complete blood count test?"" Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif., first asked Robert Kadlec, assistant secretary of Health and Human Services, at the House Oversight Committee hearing on coronavirus preparedness. PELOSI TELEGRAPHS THIRD CORONAVIRUS FUNDING BILL AMID SCRAMBLE TO CALM MARKETS Kadlec said he did not immediately know. Porter then went through, step-by-step, how much she estimated various tests and an emergency room visit would cost for an uninsured American -- pulling out a whiteboard as she did her math. “This is like ‘The Price is Right,’” she commented as she went through the costs. She eventually came to the figure of $1,331 and said it could be another $4,000 if that included a period of isolation in a hospital. ""Fear of these costs are going to keep people from being tested, from getting the care they need and from keeping their communities safe,"" Porter said. ""We live in a world where 40 percent of Americans can't even afford a $400 unexpected expense."" She then turned to Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the CDC, and asked if he wants to know who has the coronavirus: ""Not just rich people, but everybody who might have the virus?"" When Redfield said he did, she cited a statute she said allows the CDC director to authorize payment for treatment for certain people subject to quarantine and isolation and asked if he would commit to use that authority to pay for testing for every American, regardless of insurance. ""Well, I can say that we're going to do everything to make sure everybody can get the care they need,” Redfield started, before being cut off by Porter, who said his answer was “not good enough.”       Rep. Katie Porter speaks at a House Oversight Committee hearing on the coronavirus.       She continued to grill Redfield as he said CDC was working with HHS to “see how we operationalize” getting testing for all Americans and asked him to commit to free testing. HOUSE BILL THAT WOULD PROVIDE CORONAVIRUS SICK LEAVE, FREE TESTS IN FLUX “Doctor Redfield you don’t need to do any work to operationalize, you need to make a commitment to the American people so they come in to get tested,” Porter shot back. ""You can operationalize the payment structure tomorrow."" ""I think you're an excellent questioner, so my answer is yes,"" Redfield said eventually. ""Excellent. Everybody in America hear that, you are eligible to go get tested for coronavirus and have that covered, regardless of insurance,"" Porter said.

"                          GOP senators ramp up Biden investigation; Homeland Security Committee chair Sen. Ron Johnson weighs in. Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson plans to subpoena a consulting firm linked to Hunter Biden and the Ukrainian energy company he worked with for records to review potential conflicts of interest -- and whether individuals at the firm improperly used the relationship with the former vice president’s son to “influence” U.S. government agencies. Johnson had initially notified the committee’s Democratic Ranking Member Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan last month that he planned to subpoena a former consultant with the firm Blue Star Strategies. But he decided, after bipartisan meetings and briefings, to instead subpoena the firm directly for documents and records, and request interviews with the firm’s founders to discuss their work on behalf of one of their clients—Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden sat on the board. GOP SENATORS SEEK RECORDS ON 'CONNECTION' BETWEEN DEM OPERATIVES, UKRAINIAN OFFICIALS IN 2016 “This subpoena is in furtherance of the Committee’s ongoing work to address the many unanswered questions about potential conflicts of interest and the extent to which representatives of Burisma—including officials at Blue Star—used individuals with close personal connections to high-level officials within the Obama administration to gain access to and potentially influence U.S. government agencies,” Johnson wrote Thursday. The move could revive some of the same issues that President Trump sought to investigate last year, before his intervention prompted his own impeachment. Johnson plans to subpoena Blue Star for records dating back to January 1, 2013, regarding their work for Burisma Holdings, or individuals associated with Burisma’s founder, Mykola Zlochevsky. He also wants Blue Star CEO Karen Tramontano and Chief Operating Officer Sally Painter for depositions. According to State Department records obtained by the Daily Caller, Painter and Tramontano both had contact in 2016 with the agency regarding Burisma. During communications with the State Department, Painter mentioned Biden was affiliated with the company. The State Department under the Obama administration considered Burisma to be a corrupt company, a view that Blue Star was attempting to change. Johnson initially planned to subpoena a consultant from Blue Star, but said he was “bound by a non-disclosure agreement” and noted that Blue Star’s past responses to the committee were incomplete. Johnson said that, among other issues, Blue Star did not completely disclose its employees and contractors who worked on the Burisma matter. Johnson acknowledged Peters’ “disapproval” of the initial plan to subpoena just the consultant. “Your letter stated your concern ‘that the United States Senate and this Committee could be used to further disinformation efforts by Russian or other actors,’ and asked that the Committee receive defensive briefings ‘specifically regarding [the Blue Star consultant],” Johnson wrote. BIDEN-BURISMA PROBE WILL GET TO THE TRUTH, JOHNSON SAYS  “Over the last several weeks we have had a number of bipartisan meetings and briefings to discuss the subpoena and address the concerns of Committee members,” he continued. “During the course of these discussions, the suggestion was made by both Democrat and Republican members of our Committee that we should issue a subpoena directly to the source of the documents relevant to our work: Blue Star.” Johnson added that he believes the “appropriate course of action at this time is to accommodate that request.” Biden joined Burisma in April 2014 and, at the time, reportedly connected the firm with Blue Star to help the Ukrainian natural gas firm fight corruption charges. At the time of Biden’s work on the board, then-Vice President Joe Biden was running U.S.-Ukraine relations and policy for the Obama administration. Biden’s work for Burisma received heightened scrutiny amid Trump’s impeachment last year. Trump, during his now-infamous July 25, 2019 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, pressed for Kiev to look into the elder Biden's role pressing for the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had been investigating the founder of Burisma. Allies of the now-front-running Democratic presidential primary candidate maintain that his intervention at the time had nothing to do with his son, but rather was tied to corruption concerns. According to reports, by the time of Biden's intervention, the Burisma probe had been dormant. Trump's pressure campaign against Ukraine prompted a whistleblower complaint, and, in turn, the impeachment inquiry. The president’s request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats cited as a quid pro quo arrangement. Trump was acquitted on both articles of impeachment—abuse of power and obstruction of Congress—in February. Meanwhile, Johnson’s subpoena request comes amid a joint investigation led by Johnson and GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Johnson, Graham and Grassley requested information in December related to potential conflicts of interest and political influence by Ukraine, including Burisma Holdings.

"                          Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden says the coronavirus pandemic does not have a political affiliation, requires a national response. As the number of coronavirus cases in the United States rose to at least 1,600 on Friday morning, both major Democratic presidential candidates have taken President Trump to task over his administration's response to the outbreak, while rolling out plans of their own on how they would fight the virus. Former Vice President Joe Biden criticized Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic Thursday as a ""colossal"" failure and released his own plan to deal with the crisis. Here is how Biden would fight the disease officially known as COVID-19. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW TRUMP TURNS FIRE ON OBAMA-BIDEN SWINE FLU RESPONSE, DEFENDS CORONAVIRUS HANDLING Urgency Biden released his lengthy plan to combat the coronavirus online. It emphasizes that the government, ""must spend whatever it takes, without delay, to meet public health needs and deal with the mounting economic consequences."" Testing One of the top reasons the Trump administration has been criticized over its response to the coronavirus is the delays in processing test results and the number of tests available. Biden calls for making ""testing widely available and free."" CRUZ EXTENDS SELF-QUARANTINE AFTER LEARNING OF INTERACTION WITH ANOTHER CORONAVIRUS PATIENT He would set up ""at least ten"" testing locations per state, including mobile units and drive-through locations. Biden would also task a CDC program with offering tests to people who may be exposed or at risk for COVID-19 but not know they should be tested. Equipment and personnel  Biden's plan would ready the equipment in the United States' Strategic National Stockpile to be sent to areas with concentrated coronavirus outbreaks. He would also have the Department of Defense (DOD) prepare its resources to assist in responding to highly affected areas, ""activating the Medical Reserve Corps, which consists of nearly 200,000 volunteer health care professionals who stand ready to serve across America."" Biden would also take other measures to ensure hospitals are equipped, supply chains are functioning and out-of-the-way facilities, including clinics and rural hospitals, are ready to deal with an increase in coronavirus cases. Costs  Biden's coronavirus plan would ensure ""that every person, whether insured or uninsured, will not have to pay a dollar out-of-pocket for visits related to COVID-19 testing, treatment, preventative services, and any eventual vaccine."" IS CORONAVIRUS A THREAT TO CHILDREN? HOW TO KEEP THEM SAFE In an effort to make certain everyone has coverage that will take care of the cost of coronavirus treatment, Biden would provide financial incentives to states so that everyone who is eligible for Medicaid is enrolled, among other measures. Economic relief Biden would amend the federal law pertaining to worker's compensation to give employees the benefit of the doubt if they are exposed to the coronavirus through work and have to miss time. He would also require paid leave be available for a variety of reasons at 100 percent of workers' salaries up to $72,800 per year. This would also apply to domestic workers, gig workers and others who don't fit the traditional definition of an employee who would be eligible for paid leave. Biden would also reimburse employers to help with paid leave, expand unemployment eligibility for those who are laid off, expand federal food programs, establish a program to loan money to small and medium businesses and more. Worldwide CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The plan on Biden's website calls for a ""Global Health Emergency Board"" to ""convene leadership of the United States, our G7 partners, and other countries in support of the World Health Organization (WHO) to ensure a coordinated health and economic response globally, especially with respect to vulnerable countries."" Additionally, Biden would mobilize resources to protect American diplomats and troops abroad while also working with other countries to prepare for future pandemics. ""The Biden Administration will build the global coalition necessary to fill urgent global gaps in pandemic preparedness, enhance accountability for those investments, and produce measurable results,"" the plan says.

"                          President Trump says he's not concerned after an aide to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro tested positive for the coronavirus after they dined together at an event. President Trump announced that he plans to hold a press conference Friday afternoon to address the coronavirus crisis, as concerns over the spreading outbreak wreak havoc on the economy and American life. ""I will be having a news conference today at 3:00 P.M., The White House. Topic: CoronaVirus!"" he tweeted. The announcement also comes amid conflicting reports over whether another person who came in contact with Trump in recent days -- Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro -- tested positive. Bolsonaro’s son Eduardo initially told Fox News that they were doing further testing to confirm the diagnosis. But minutes later, he told Fox News' ""America's Newsroom"" that the test came back negative. ""Everything’s good now,"" he said. Bolsonaro had been tested after one of his deputies, who also attended the meetings at Mar-a-Lago, tested positive for COVID-19. This comes days after they met with the president and vice president at Mar-a-Lago. BRAZIL'S PRESIDENT BOLSONARO TESTS POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS Amid these reports, a number of White House officials were called into an urgent meeting in the chief of staff’s office, Fox News was told Friday morning. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., also announced on Thursday that he was in self-quarantine after attending the meeting with Trump and Bolsonaro’s team at Mar-a-Lago. The president, at this point, has not been tested for coronavirus, even after having met with individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19 or interacted with others who have. Earlier this week, several Republican lawmakers went into self-quarantine, after an attendee of the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 26 to Feb. 29 notified CPAC organizers that he had tested positive. TRUMP DOUBLES DOWN ON CALL FOR PAYROLL TAX CUT AMID COVID-19 Both Trump and Vice President Pence, who has been appointed to lead the official Coronavirus Task Force, attended and spoke at CPAC.

Doug Collins on a trip last Friday to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, and Rep. Matt Gatez traveled on Air Force One on Monday. Both are in self-quarantine. Meanwhile, the president tweeted Friday morning touting ""strong border policy,"" saying that if U.S. borders were weak, more American coronavirus-related deaths would have been recorded at this point. “To this point, and because we have had a very strong border policy, we have had 40 deaths related to CoronaVirus. If we had weak or open borders, that number would be many times higher!” Trump tweeted Friday. The president, on Wednesday night after the World Health Organization designated COVID-19 a global pandemic, announced a temporary halt on air travel to the United States from Europe, excluding flights from the United Kingdom and those carrying cargo, in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. The outbreak is believed to have originated at an animal and seafood market in the city of Wuhan, China.

CPAC ATTENDEE WITH CORONAVIRUS HAD CONTACT WITH ‘SEVERAL’ MEMBERS OF CONGRESS: PHYSICIAN Cruz had been under self-quarantine, like several other Republican lawmakers, after attending the CPAC conference two weeks ago, where one person who attended was later revealed to have been infected. Before Cruz's quarantine, the senator also met on March 3 in his Washington D.C. office with Santiago Abascal, the leader of the Vox Party in Spain, who announced Thursday he tested positive for the virus. ""We met for about 20 minutes, sitting together at a conference table. We shook hands twice and took pictures together,"" Cruz said, noting that the Spanish politician was asymptomatic at the time. Cruz said he'll extend his self-quarantine until March 17. “I’m still not feeling any symptoms. I’m consulting with medical officials. But, for the same reasons I initially self-quarantined—out of an abundance of caution and to give everyone peace of mind—I am extending the self-quarantine to March 17, a full fourteen days from my meeting with Mr. Abascal,"" Cruz said. BRAZIL'S PRESIDENT BOLSONARO TESTS POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS No lawmakers have tested positive for coronavirus. But several politicians have been in self-isolation after coming into contact with someone who was infected. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., announced earlier this week they would self-isolate because they were at Mar-a-Lago over the weekend with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and his press secretary Fabio Wajngarten, who both tested positive for the virus after meeting with President Trump and others.

"                          Trump makes no apology for unilaterally banning travel from Europe in face of coronavirus pandemic; chief White House correspondent John Roberts reports. President Trump on Friday doubled down on calls for a payroll tax cut through the end of the year, arguing the move could be “really meaningful” and help to stabilize the economy amid the coronavirus outbreak. “If you want to get money into the hands of people quickly & efficiently, let them have the full money that they earned, APPROVE A PAYROLL TAX CUT until the end of the year, December 31. Then you are doing something that is really meaningful. Only that will make a big difference!” Trump tweeted Friday morning. Trump first floated the idea of temporarily nixing the payroll tax earlier this week. The president proposed slashing the tax for both employers and employees from 14.4 percent to zero. He also mentioned moves to aid small businesses and help hourly workers who might become sick. Sources even told Fox News that Trump would like to eventually make the payroll tax cut permanent and fund Social Security, Medicare and unemployment insurance from general revenues — moves that could further swell the deficit. Democrats have pushed back on these calls as lawmakers craft new legislation. TRUMP FLOATS TEMPORARILY ELIMINATING PAYROLL TAX Meanwhile, the president also called for the Federal Reserve to lower rates, and blasted Chairman Jerome Powell along the way. “The Federal Reserve must FINALLY lower the Fed Rate to something comparable to their competitor Central Banks. Jay Powell and group are putting us at a decided economic & physiological disadvantage. Should never have been this way. Also, STIMULATE!” Trump tweeted. The World Health Organization designated the outbreak a global pandemic on Wednesday. That night, during an Oval Office address to the nation, President Trump announced a temporary halt on air travel to the United States from Europe, excluding flights from the United Kingdom and those carrying cargo, in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. “The virus will not have a chance against us,” Trump said Wednesday. “No nation is more prepared, or more resilient.” The president appointed Vice President Pence to lead the Coronavirus Task Force, which has been providing daily press briefings and sharing information on the Trump administration’s new measures to combat the spread of COVID-19 across the nation. On Tuesday, Pence announced that insurance companies agreed to waive all co-pays on coronavirus testing and treatment amid the threat. Pence also announced that more than 4 million tests would be disbursed across the country by the end of the week. Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Seema Varna also announced Tuesday that the administration has removed “prior authorization requirements” for Medicare and Medicaid recipients and would “waive prescription refill limits and expand more access.” TRUMP: 'CORONAVIRUS DOES NOT CARE WHAT PARTY YOU ARE IN' The outbreak is believed to have originated at an animal and seafood market in the city of Wuhan, China. As of Friday morning, there were more than 1,600 cases of coronavirus in the United States, in 47 states, including Washington, D.C. The U.S. has, so far, seen 41 coronavirus-related deaths. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the WHO, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders compared how the U.S. should be responding to the pandemic, as declared this week by the World Health Organization, to the ""scale of a major war."" He laid out his vision for how the government should fight the coronavirus in a speech Thursday. Here is how Sanders would fight the disease officially known as COVID-19. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW DEMOCRACY 2020 DIGEST: SANDERS CITES CORONAVIRUS TO RENEW 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' PUSH Urgency Sanders warned Thursday that ""the number of casualties"" from the coronavirus ""may actually be even higher than what the armed forces experienced in World War II."" He said that he would declare a national emergency if he were president and called on Trump to do the same. Testing Sanders lamented that the U.S. medical system does not currently have the means to deal with a worst-case scenario coronavirus outbreak. He said that the government should ""respond aggressively to make certain that we, in fact, have the latest and most effective tests available and the quickest means of processing those tests.""

""None of the medical experts that I have talked to dispute that there is a major shortage of ICU units and ventilators that are needed to respond to this crisis,"" Sanders said. He called on the government to ""aggressively"" work with private businesses to ensure hospitals have that equipment. Additionally, Sanders asked, ""medical residents, retired medical professionals and other medical personnel to help us deal with this crisis."" Costs ""The pharmaceutical industry must be told in no uncertain terms that the medicines that they manufacture for this crisis will be sold at cost,"" Sanders said Thursday. He said he would not tolerate ""price gouging or profiteering."" Economic relief Sanders called for help for those who lose their jobs or can't work because of the coronavirus, ""instead of providing more tax breaks to the top one percent and large corporations."" The Vermont senator recommended 100 percent salary compensation capped at $60,000 per year for those who lose their jobs, as well as help for tipped workers at restaurants and other establishments that are seeing fewer customers as people stay home to avoid spreading the disease. TRUMP TURNS FIRE ON OBAMA-BIDEN SWINE FLU RESPONSE, DEFENDS CORONAVIRUS HANDLING Sanders would also have school lunches delivered to students' homes, put a moratorium on evictions and foreclosures, build emergency homeless shelters and ban utilities from shutting off services to people who miss their bills. The democratic socialist senator also said he would give emergency loans to small and medium businesses. 'Medicare-for-all' He also cited the outbreak to renew his call for his signature policy. Sanders said that if the U.S. had already implemented his ""Medicare-for-all"" proposal, it would be in better shape to fight the coronavirus pandemic because people would not be as reluctant to seek treatment.

CHINA HINTS AT DENYING AMERICANS LIFE-SAVING CORONAVIRUS DRUGS ""I think what the vice president meant to say was the same thing that again many members have said in the last few days,"" Gibbs said in a press briefing, vaguely defending Biden after a question from a reporter about accusations that the former vice president came ""close to fearmongering"" in televised comments. ""I understand what he said, I'm telling you what he meant to say,"" Gibbs continued to laughter from the press corps after he was pushed further. ""Obviously, if anybody was unduly alarmed for whatever reason we would apologize for that and I hope that my remarks and remarks of people at the CDC and [Obama Homeland Security] Secretary [Janet] Napolitano have appropriately cleared up what he meant to say."" INSIDE CHINA'S HIGH-STAKES CAMPAIGN TO SMEAR THE UNITED STATES OVER CORONAVIRUS The president also blamed red tape at the CDC and the Obama administration for complicating what his administration has been able to do in response to the novel coronavirus. ""For decades the @CDCgov looked at, and studied, its testing system, but did nothing about it. It would always be inadequate and slow for a large scale pandemic, but a pandemic would never happen, they hoped. President Obama made changes that only complicated things further,"" Trump tweeted. ""Their response to H1N1 Swine Flu was a full scale disaster, with thousands dying, and nothing meaningful done to fix the testing problem, until now. The changes have been made and testing will soon happen on a very large scale basis. All Red Tape has been cut, ready to go!"" CORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE=BY-STATE BREAKDOWN Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, admitted in testimony on Thursday that the ability of Americans to get tested for coronavirus is not up to the standard of other countries, adding the U.S. should be better equipped. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., asked about people’s ability to get tested while pointing out that even health care workers have been denied access to testing. “The system is not really geared to what we need right now — what you’re asking for,” Fauci said. “That is a failing.” As cases spread around the globe, the extent of infections in the U.S. remains to be seen. So far, over 1,600 cases have been reported. That number is sure to rise in the near future, but a historic wave of decisions in the public and private sectors meant to limit exposure and transmission could help curb the spread of the virus -- with major sporting events and schools and other venues being closed, and many businesses moving to telework policies for now. According to the CDC, between 2009 and 2010, swine flu resulted in over 60 million U.S. cases, and more than 12,000 deaths. It remains unclear at this stage how the novel coronavirus will compare. Biden's plan to fight the coronavirus, he said Thursday, includes emergency paid leave for people sick because of the virus, assistance to small businesses, free testing, the development of a vaccine and the mobilization of government supplies and workers to combat the disease. Biden said, ""protecting the health and safety of the American people is the most important job of any president. Unfortunately, this virus laid bare the severe shortcomings of the current administration. Public fears are being compounded by pervasive lack of trust in this president, fueled by an adversarial relationship with truth that he continues to have. Our government’s ability to respond effectively has been undermined by hollowing out our agencies and disparagement of science."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP One of the main faults Biden flagged with the administration's response to the coronavirus is the delays in rolling out tests for the disease caused by the coronavirus, known officially as COVID-19. ""The administration's failure on testing is colossal. And it's a failure of planning, leadership and execution,"" he said, ""By next week, the number of tests should be in the millions, not the thousands.""

"                          Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden says the coronavirus pandemic does not have a political affiliation, requires a national response. U.S. Rep. Dan Crenshaw fired back overnight after former Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden criticized President Trump’s actions on the coronavirus outbreak. “A wall will not stop the coronavirus,” Biden wrote on Twitter on Thursday night, attempting to link the outbreak to Trump’s signature immigration goal of a strong barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border. “Banning all travel from Europe – or any other part of the world – will not stop it,” Biden continued, taking aim at the temporary travel policy Trump announced this week. “This disease could impact every nation and any person on the planet – and we need a plan to combat it.” CORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN Biden’s tweet echoed comments he made the same day in a speech in his home state of Delaware, which he represented in the U.S. Senate for more than three decades before becoming vice president under former President Obama. But Crenshaw, a freshman Republican congressman from Texas, spotted what he viewed as flaws in Biden’s thinking and shared his thoughts in a Twitter message of his own. “First, walls quite literally stop a virus,” Crenshaw wrote. “It’s kind of the whole point of a quarantine, for instance. “Second, assuming you meant this metaphorically, health experts like Dr. Fauci and everyone else agree travel restrictions have vastly slowed the spread of the virus in the US.” Crenshaw was referring to Dr. Anthony Fauci, a respected immunologist with the National Institutes of Health who serves on the president’s Coronavirus Task Force, charged with crafting the federal government’s response to the outbreak under the direction of Vice President Mike Pence. Earlier in the week, Fauci told Fox News’ Sean Hannity there was “no question” that Trump’s initial travel restriction targeting China – epicenter of the outbreak – had helped protect the U.S. “Yes, there's no question that if we had not done that in a timely way, there would have been many more travel-related cases from China,” Fauci said during an appearance on “Hannity.” “And as you know, the outbreak that we're having here in the country, these cases originated from travel-related cases that came from China -- and then we had the issue in Washington state and what we're seeing now in other states. “So, coming from outside within was the thing that started it. So, I think [Trump’s travel restriction against flights from China] saved us a lot of — a lot of concern and a lot of suffering, I think.” Meanwhile, many people concerned they might have been exposed to the virus – but not yet certain, as they await testing or testing results – have voluntarily quarantined themselves in hopes of avoiding spreading the virus to others. The self-quarantining individuals have included members of Congress as well as professional sports figures — all of whom travel extensively, coming in contact with large numbers of people in multiple parts of the country, as part of their work.

Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders may be getting lots of media attention as the battle for their party’s presidential nomination heats up, but voters in Iowa appear to be solidly behind President Trump for November. Trump leads Biden 51 percent to 41 percent and leads Sanders 53 percent to 41 percent in Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll results released Thursday. TRUMP CAMPAIGN MOCKS DEM PRIMARY BATTLE, SAYS PRESIDENT ON 'UNSTOPPABLE DRIVE TOWARD REELECTION' The same poll, conducted March 2-5, also showed Trump with a 50 percent approval rating in Iowa – the president’s highest ever in the Hawkeye State, according to the Register. The president’s strongest support in Iowa was among Republicans (94 percent), rural Iowans (68 percent), evangelicals (63 percent), men (60 percent), and those with annual income of $100,000 or greater (57 percent). Iowans supported Barack Obama for president in both 2008 and 2012 but were all in for Trump in 2016 over Hillary Clinton, backing the New York businessman by a greater margin than traditionally conservative states such as Texas, The Hill reported.

"                          How are hospitals preparing? Fox News contributor Dr. Nicole Saphier weighs in. Gov.  Gavin Newsom, the California Democrat, released an executive order on Thursday that includes the authority for Sacramento to take over hotels and motels for medical use for coronavirus patients, in a move he said will help the state of 40 million prepare for any widespread outbreak. Some patients in the state have already been moved to hotels. The Desert Sun reported that a 120-room hotel in  San Carlos, which is near San Francisco, has been already tapped to house passengers from the Grand Princess cruise ship. The first-term governor told reporters that besides hotels and motels, state officials are also scouting for potential lodging in ""mothballed"" facilities and state parks. TOM HANKS SHARES HEALTH UPDATE The executive order, according to the report, has been designed to allow the state’s Health and Human Services Agency and the Office of Emergency Services to commandeer private property for coronavirus treatment. It also offers economic relief for residents. “This is where we need to go next, and to make sure we fully implement those procedures and protocols to slow down the spread to get through a peak and to get through the next few months, so we don’t overwhelm our healthcare delivery system,” Newsom said, according to the Los Angeles Times. The report pointed out that there are 198 known cases of COVID -19 in the state of about 40 million.  GET THE LATEST ON THE CORONAVIRUS State and local leaders were weighing short-term help for small businesses and individuals, with Newsom’s executive order eliminating a one-week waiting period for unemployment benefits.

"                          Reaction and analysis from former deputy assistant attorney general John Yoo. In a sign of these volatile times, President Trump’s Oval Office speech wasn’t even the most noteworthy thing that happened that hour. In rapid succession, starting at 9 p.m. eastern Wednesday, Tom Hanks revealed that he and his wife have the coronavirus, and the NBA suspended its season after one player tested positive. By the next morning, the stock market continued to crater, forcing a second automatic trading halt, as the Dow plunged another 2,300 points—capping a collapse that wiped out more than 80 percent of its gains during the Trump years. JOURNALISTS FEAR CONTRACTING VIRUS AS COVERAGE INCREASINGLY CRITICIZED And by yesterday afternoon, the NCAA had pulled the plug on the March Madness tournament. Major League Baseball had canceled spring training and delayed Opening Day by at least two weeks. The NHL had also frozen the hockey season. This may well be the new normal, as everyone in America struggles to cope with a pandemic that has altered our lives in ways large and small. The media, which have also been deeply affected, is scrambling just to keep pace with the breakneck pace of developments. It’s really no longer a question of whether journalists are hyping the virus, it’s a business trying to shovel out information that is changing hour by hour. The sports cancellations may be a blow to fans, but the mushrooming wave of colleges sending students packing (in favor of online classes) is disrupting the lives of countless families. Some public school systems are taking, or weighing, similar steps. And Broadway is shutting down, at least until the middle of April. Who thought we’d be living in a world where states like New York and California are banning gatherings of more than 250 or 500 people? Or where the Capitol and White House would announce yesterday that they’re essentially closed to the public? For all the personal hardships and inconveniences, a news flash like Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson announcing they have the virus—from Australia, where he’s filming an Elvis Presley movie—is more than a gossip item. Hanks is a beloved figure who played Mr. Rogers without being out of character. But more than that, as the first celebrity to contract the disease, he is now the face of the virus crisis. And it was easier for the couple to get tested in Sydney than it would have been in the States. SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES This has gotten personal, as well, for the people who cover the story. The Washington Post and New York Times are encouraging staffers to work at home. CBS has shut down its New York headquarters after two confirmed cases. The network morning shows, late-night shows, and other programs like “The View” have dropped their studio audiences. So when Trump delivered his White House speech, he was confronting a threat that goes well beyond political warfare. It is now a cultural calamity. The president’s sober tone was good, a significant departure from many earlier comments in which he minimized the impact of the virus and blamed public concern on the media and the Democrats. But the steps he announced were limited, and he didn’t really address the lack of widespread testing that people across the spectrum agree has been the most significant failure in this mess. What really undercut the Trump speech were the hasty corrections afterwards, such as that the 30-day ban on travel from Europe doesn’t apply to American citizens or residents, or to trade between the countries. How does what was arguably the most important address of his presidency not get vetted more carefully than that? Maybe no presidential speech could have totally calmed the country. Perhaps no words from Washington could stop a Wall Street slide that reflects global economic damage. But there is a deep sense of unease in the country that transcends politics, one that isn’t likely to fade any time soon.

"                          President Trump and members of the coronavirus task force hold news conference from the White House, detailing additional steps the federal government is taking to stop the spread of coronavirus. President Trump on Friday declared a national emergency over the coronavirus outbreak amid extensive disruptions to the economy and American life, announcing partnerships with major U.S. companies to expand testing capabilities while saying he believes the crisis ""will pass.” The president also announced that he would likely be tested for coronavirus “fairly soon,” after having been in contact with several individuals who have self-quarantined, or tested positive, for the virus. Speaking to reporters, the president also said his administration is working to ""dramatically increase the availability of tests,"" amid concerns over the availability of tests for coronavirus, or COVID-19, across the country. WHAT AN EMERGENCY DECLARATION MEANS “We are announcing a new partnership with the private sector to vastly increase and accelerate our capacity to test for the coronavirus,” Trump said during the Rose Garden press conference. “We want people to take a test quickly if they need. But we don’t want people to take the test if we feel they shouldn’t be doing it.” The president’s declaration of a national emergency means that he will enact the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, which allows the White House to mobilize the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and direct federal aid to states hit by disasters and health crises. President Trump addresses the media during coronavirus news conference from the White House. ""I am officially declaring a national emergency -- two very big words,"" Trump continued. ""The action I am taking will open up access to up to $50 billion...and a large amount of money for states, territories and localities."" He added: ""We&apos;ve been working very hard on this. We will overcome the threat of the virus."" According to the latest FEMA report to Congress, which was transmitted Feb. 29, 2020, there is $42.6 billion in the Disaster Relief Fund, which can be tapped under a Stafford Act declaration. In addition to declaring an emergency under the Stafford Act, the president also declared an emergency under the National Emergencies Act, which allows the Department of Health and Human Services to waive certain guidelines related to Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP to address the coronavirus. TRUMP SAYS HE WILL ‘MOST LIKELY’ BE TESTED FOR CORONAVIRUS ‘FAIRLY SOON’ During his speech, Trump was joined by the official coronavirus task force, led by Vice President Pence and leaders of major corporations and businesses, including Target, Walgreens, Quest Diagnostics and CVS Health. Trump said that with federal emergency authorities, the Food and Drug Administration approved a new test of the virus, which would provide “half a million additional tests” that will be available “early next week.” ""Our overriding goal is to stop the spread of this virus and help Americans impacted by this,” he said. “Again, we don’t want everyone to take the test.” He added: “This will pass…It’s going to pass through…and we’ll be all the stronger for it.” The declaration of a national emergency also cuts through red tape with Medicare, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program; chief White House correspondent John Roberts reports. Meanwhile, the president said he would ask hospitals across the nation to activate their ""emergency preparedness plans,"" and said his designation of a national emergency would allow HHS Secretary Alexander Azar to waive ""provisions of applicable laws and regulations"" to give medical professionals and hospitals the ""flexibility"" to care for all patients. The president said that Azar will have the ability to enable ""telehealth"" for remote doctor visits and hospital check-ins, and the ability to waive hospital stay limits, as well as obtain additional office and hospital space. ""They can now do as they want and do what they have to do, they know what they have to do now, they don&apos;t have any problem getting it done,"" Trump said. The Trump administration has also partnered with pharmacies and retailers to make drive-through tests available in “critical locations” identified by public health professionals, he said. “The goal is for individuals to be able to drive up and be swabbed without having to leave your car,” Trump said, while thanking Google for creating a website to help implement the drive-through test taking technology. Trump said Google was going to “very quickly” get the website “done, unlike websites in the past,” he said in a veiled and apparent swipe at the Obama administration’s roll-out of healthcare.gov. “Google has 1,700 engineers working on this right now,” Trump said. But that wasn&apos;t his only swipe at the Obama administration Friday. Trump was asked about the H1N1 pandemic--which former President Barack Obama declared a national emergency over in 2009. Read: Trump letter declaring coronavirus national emergency under Stafford Act by Fox News on Scribd ""It was nothing like this and they actually lost approximately 14,000 people,"" Trump said, slamming the Obama administration for thinking about testing ""far too late."" ""We’ve done it very early and we’ve also kept a lot of people out,"" Trump said. In response to a question, reminding Trump that the past administration had tested ""1 million people,"" he replied: ""They had a very big failure with swine flu. Very big failure."" In recent days, major sporting and other events were called off or postponed, businesses across the country instituted telework policies, government buildings and schools shuttered and other disruptions rock the nation, amid efforts to curb the transmission of the virus. ""We have to make short term sacrifices which will produce long term gains,"" Trump said, while praising the cancellation of national sporting leagues as having done ""a great service."" ""We&apos;re with you every step of the way. No nation is more prepared or more equipped to face this, as you know,"" Trump said. ""With faith and heart and hope, we will succeeed and we will prevail. We will be very, very successful and learn for the future."" The president also said that he would waive interest on federally held student loans and moved to prop up energy markets, by directing the Department of Energy to buy oil to fill the strategic petroleum reserve ""right up to the top."" Every U.S. president since 1976 has declared at least one national emergency. Former President Obama declared an emergency in 2009 over the H1N1 influenza pandemic and former President George W. Bush declared two national emergencies in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. Trump&apos;s announcement Friday also comes amid conflicting reports over whether another person who came in contact with Trump in recent days—Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro—tested positive. The president, decisively, told reporters that he does not have any symptoms of coronavirus. ""I don&apos;t have any of the symptoms...White House doctors, and there are a lot of them, say you don&apos;t have any symptoms whatsoever,"" Trump said. ""And we don&apos;t want people without symptoms to go out and do the test."" He added: ""The test is not insignificant."" The announcement of the national emergency also comes after the World Health Organization designated COVID-19 a global pandemic. Following that designation, the president announced a temporary halt on air travel to the United States from Europe, excluding flights from the United Kingdom and those carrying cargo, in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. ""As you know, Europe was just designated as the hot spot right now and we closed it,"" Trump said Friday, questioning whether it was a matter of ""talent or through luck"" to act early. ""Call it whatever you want,"" Trump said, noting any families returning from Europe ""will be subject to extra screening or a period of isolation for 14 days.""

In a 363-40 vote early Saturday, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a coronavirus response package negotiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. All House Democrats supported the plan while 40 Republicans opposed it. Rep. Justin Amash, an independent from Michigan who is a former Republican, voted ""present."" Prior to the vote, which occurred shortly before 1 a.m. ET Saturday, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., spoke to reporters about the deal that had been worked out, saying ""some things needed to be cleaned up."" President Trump said Friday night that he supported the package -- in an apparent effort to get skeptical House Republicans on board with the legislation. ""I fully support H.R. 6201: Families First CoronaVirus Response Act, which will be voted on in the House this evening,"" Trump tweeted. ""This Bill will follow my direction for free CoronaVirus tests, and paid sick leave for our impacted American workers ..."" ""I encourage all Republicans and Democrats to come together and VOTE YES!"" Trump later added. ""I will always put the health and well-being of Americans FIRST. Look forward to signing the final bill, ASAP!"" Pelosi intially informed colleagues of a deal with the Trump administration at around 6 p.m. ET Friday. “We are proud to have reached an agreement with the administration to resolve outstanding challenges, and now will soon pass the Families First Coronavirus Response Act,” the California Democrat said in a letter. However, Fox News later learned that Mnuchin had not yet signed off on the pact. TRUMP DECLARES NATIONAL EMERGENCY OVER CORONAVIRUS, ENLISTS PRIVATE SECTOR Shortly before 8 p.m. ET, Mnuchin told Fox Business Network&apos;s ""Lou Dobbs Tonight"": ""We have an agreement that reflects what the president talked about in his speech the other [Wednesday] night. He&apos;s very focused on making sure that we can deal with the coronavirus, that people who have to be home quarantined -- that hard-working Americans don&apos;t lose their compensation because they have to be home quarantined. ""Obviously we expect the bigger corporations to pick up these costs,"" Mnuchin added, ""and we also want to make sure that people can get free testing. The president wants lots of testing. One of the things the market responded very positively to was [that] the president has made just enormous progress with all these big companies coming in and saying that there&apos;s testing."" The apparent problems caught Democrats by surprise: House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said “we thought we had an agreement,” adding: “I want to vote tonight.” Fox News is told the major objection to the bill from House Republicans was extraneous matters House Democrats kept trying to include in the coronavirus package. Shortly before 10 p.m., Pelosi informed her Democratic caucus that the ""process has taken some time,"" adding that “language incorporating the last details into the text is currently being written and should be completed soon.” Sources told Fox that if the measure passed the House with an overwhelming majority, the Senate would take it up next week. Earlier Friday, President Trump declared a national emergency over the coronavirus outbreak and announced partnerships with major U.S. companies to expand testing capabilities. “This legislation is about testing, testing, testing,” Pelosi said. “To stop the spread of the virus, we have secured free coronavirus testing for everyone who needs a test, including the uninsured. We cannot fight coronavirus effectively unless everyone in our country who needs to be tested can get their test free of charge.” CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE According to Pelosi, the bill includes paid emergency leave with two weeks of paid sick leave and up to three months of paid family and medical leave. “We have also secured enhanced unemployment insurance, a step that will extend protections to furloughed workers,” she said. Pelosi also said the bill will include nutrition security initiatives “including SNAP, student meals, seniors’ nutrition and food banks.” The Democrat said “22 million children rely on free or reduced-price school meals for their food security; we must ensure that they have food to eat.” She also said the bill will include increased federal funds for Medicaid to support local, state, tribal and territorial governments and health systems “so that they have the resources necessary to combat this crisis.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The revisions to the Democratic bill happened after the GOP flagged “major” concerns about the sick leave legislation on Thursday. McCarthy criticized the initial legislation for creating a paid sick leave program through the Social Security Administration that he said would take six months to set up and hamper the agency’s normal functioning of disbursing checks to senior citizens. He also objected to forcing permanent paid sick leave ""for all businesses without exemptions and no sunsets,"" McCarthy said. Late Friday, McCarthy told reporters the bill ""had some things which needed to be cleaned up."" ""This is a really good sign that shows bipartisanship, that we can overcome this virus,"" he said. "" ... It was very important to get this done before anybody departed."" Trump had pressed for a payroll tax holiday to give some economic relief to Americans, but Pelosi has not included that in this bill, though she&apos;s signaled more legislation could be needed as the scope and hurt of the pandemic is fully realized.

"                          Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders addresses the changes being made to his campaign during the outbreak. Sen. Bernie Sanders says the coronavirus outbreak “has radically changed our campaign.” Speaking with reporters Friday from his hometown of Burlington, Vt., the populist senator -- who’s making his second straight bid for the Democratic presidential nomination -- acknowledged that “we are in the process of thinking this through but this coronavirus has obviously impacted our ability to communicate with people in the tradition that we do and that’s hurting.” THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN  Welcome to a presidential race without a traditional campaign trail -- where virtual campaigning is fast becoming the new normal. While Sanders is hunkered down in his hometown, Biden’s doing the same as he remains in Wilmington, Del. Both candidates will travel to the nation’s capital for Sunday’s Democratic presidential nomination debate. The faceoff between the two remaining major Democratic contenders was moved to a TV studio in Washington, D.C., after a live audience in Arizona was abruptly canceled this week due to concerns over the grown coronavirus pandemic. With traditional rallies and town halls a thing of the past, following warnings against large gatherings coming from public and health officials on Friday, Biden held his first virtual town hall with Illinois voters ahead of their Tuesday presidential primary. “We’ll continue to assess and adjust how we conduct our campaign as we move forward and find new ways to share our message with the public while putting the health and safety of the American people first,” Biden said on Thursday. His campaign also announced that fundraisers with top-dollar donors -- which the former vice president had almost always done in person -- were also going the virtual route. On Friday, Sanders highlighted that he’ll showcase what he said was an already-robust online campaign. “What I think we have going for us which we’ve always had going for us but what we’re going to utilize even more is our internet capabilities. We have many, many millions of people follow us on Twitter, follow us on other platforms. We livestream everything that we do,” the senator said. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK  Both campaigns are asking their staff at their national headquarters and at field offices across the country to work from home. “Our staff is now by and large working at home,” Sanders noted. And top Biden officials also said that starting on Saturday that “all Biden for president employees both in our Philadelphia headquarters and in field offices across the country will work from home.” Bayou State postponement  Louisiana moved to postpone its April 4 presidential primary due to concerns over the coronavirus outbreak, state election officials announced Friday. The primary -- which includes mayoral races and local propositions, as well as the presidential ballot -- will instead be held June 20, Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin announced at a news conference in Baton Rouge. Christina Stephens, a spokeswoman for Louisiana Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards, told Fox News the governor was expected to sign an executive order later on Friday officially moving the election to June. Louisiana is the first state that’s holding an upcoming primary or caucus to move to delay their contest. Louisiana is one of only five states that gives governors the power to move elections due to an emergency. Sanders, when asked about the postponement of Louisiana&apos;s primary, told reporters that ""elections are the bedrock of our democracy and we don’t want to be delaying elections on a willy nilly basis."" But he stressed that ""there is obviously a growing concern about bringing people together and spreading the virus... I don’t think there’s anybody out there -- no matter what your political view may be -- that wants to see people become infected because they are voting."" Last-minute polling place changes  Four states hold primaries on Tuesday – Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio. Election officials in the four states are making last-minute moves -- such as moving polling places away from locations with heavy concentrations of high-risk people, such as nursing homes. Meanwhile, Arizona&apos;s Secretary of State&apos;s office told Fox News it couldn&apos;t move the date of their primary because it would require legislative action. The secretary of states of Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio put out a joint statement emphasizing that “we are working closely with our state health officials to ensure that our poll workers and voters can be confident that voting is safe.” “Unlike concerts, sporting events or other mass gatherings where large groups of people travel long distances to congregate in a confined space for an extended period of time, polling locations see people from a nearby community coming into and out of the building for a short duration,” they noted. And the secretary of states highlighted that “guidance from voting machine manufacturers on how best to sanitize machines, guidance from CDC on best practices for hand washing, and guidance from our respective state health officials is being provided to every polling location.” &apos;Get tested&apos; Sanders is one of the latest in a growing list of people to urge that President Trump get tested for coronavirus, which is officially known as COVID-19. CLICK HERE FOR FOX NEWS&apos; COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE  Asked on Friday by Fox News if the president should take a test, Sanders answered: “I would. You know, I was asked early on, to the best of my knowledge, I have not been in proximity to somebody who had the virus. If I knew that I was, I would get tested, and I think that holds true for the president.” The president has recently been in contact with a number of people who have tested positive for the virus. On Friday afternoon -- after declaring a national emergency in response to the pandemic -- Trump said he will “most likely” be tested for coronavirus “fairly soon.” But the president shook hands with some of those who joined him for the major announcement. That violated a major rule his public health officials have stressed, to avoid shaking hands. Fox News&apos; Lee Ross and Andrew Craft contributed to this report.

"                          Why the global number of coronavirus cases are likely much higher; Dr. Marty Makary gives his take. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio doubled down Friday on his decision not to shut down public schools, despite increasing pressure to do so from teacher unions and other Democratic politicians. “We shut down the school system, we might not see it for the rest of the school year. We might not see the beginning of the new school year. And that weighs heavily on me,” the mayor said, according to The New York Times. CORONAVIRUS HAS NEW YORKERS WAKING UP IN A CITY THAT NEVER SLEEPS TO BIG CHANGES  Public schools in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Atlanta and other cities have closed down due to the coronavirus outbreak. There have been statewide closures in some states, including Virginia, Ohio and Washington state. New York is temporarily closing schools where students or teachers test positive for the virus, but the state has so far held off on broader closures. In the Big Apple, shutting down schools would be one of the most consequential shutdowns in the country, and some have expressed concerns about possible ripple effects.  Workers in crucial areas such as transportion and medical care, for instance, may have to take time off to care for children. Many low-income families also rely on schools for meals, medical help and even laundry services. But teacher unions have increased pressure on de Blasio, a Democrat, to shutter schools, saying it is an important move to stop the spread of a deadly virus that has turned into a pandemic. CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE “We must find ways to keep our children safe and to see that they are fed. We must do all we can to help ensure that our students can continue to learn,” United Federation of Teachers President Michael Mulgrew said in a statement. “But we have reached the point where continuing to keep our classrooms open poses a greater lasting threat than the disruption that will result from school closings.” NYC Council Speaker Corey Johnson, who supports the closures, tweeted: “Teaching and learning cannot take place under these circumstances."" “The City must immediately come up with a plan that includes childcare relief for families who need it so that our essential workers, especially healthcare workers, can continue with their duties,” he said. But de Blasio still has the support of other leaders, including Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has the power to shut down schools statewide but has so far not chosen to do so. According to the Times, Cuomo has said that evidence from other hard-hit countries is unclear on whether children were carriers of the virus. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW De Blasio brushed off the criticism from those calling for closures, saying: “This isn’t a popularity contest -- this is war.” His decision to keep schools open has drawn support from other unions, such as those representing health care workers. “While calls to close New York City’s public schools are being received, we urge Mayor de Blasio to recognize the plight of the healthcare workers, transit workers, and other essential workers who are unable to take time off,” George Gresham, the president of 1199SEIU, said in a statement. “These hardworking women and men rely on our public schools to not only educate their children, but to provide a safe environment for them while their parents work.” CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP “Closing New York City’s public schools with no care plan for these children would place a dire strain on our social infrastructure by reducing the healthcare workforce, and possibly halting the gains being made to help curb the spread of COVID-19. This would undoubtedly pose an even greater danger to New York’s families,” he said. The debate within New York City comes as the country as a whole is taking increased steps to combat the virus. President Trump on Friday declared a national emergency in order to free up nearly $50 billion in funding for states. The House passed a coronavirus response package late Friday, sending it to the Senate for consideration.

""We are a Country that, throughout our history, has looked to God for protection and strength in times like these....,"" Trump tweeted. ""No matter where you may be, I encourage you to turn towards prayer in an act of faith. Together, we will easily PREVAIL!"" The annual National Day of Prayer is scheduled for May 7. Trump&apos;s announcement came after he declared a national emergency over the coronavirus pandemic, in addition to partnerships with several large companies to expand testing for the illness. Trump has large support from white evangelical Christians and Catholic voters. As president, he&apos;s championed religious liberty and called for greater religious freedoms, such as strengthening prayer in public schools. In addition to the updated guidance on prayer in schools, the Trump administration also took action across nine federal agencies, releasing proposed rules to ensure religious organizations are not discriminated against by the federal government.

By a 26-point spread, voters have a more positive than negative view of capitalism (56 favorable - 30 unfavorable). The opposite holds true for socialism, where sentiment is net negative by 30 points (28 favorable - 58 unfavorable). CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS That’s almost exactly where things stood a year ago, despite the popularity of Sen. Bernie Sanders&apos;, I-Vt., presidential campaign. The Democratic presidential frontrunner says “billionaires should not exist,” yet 76 percent of voters overall and 67 percent of Democrats think it’s a good thing people can become billionaires in the United States. For many though, there are limits.  Voters agree by a 56-35 percent margin the government “should increase taxes on the wealthiest individuals so that nobody gets to be too rich.”  A decade ago, it was the reverse: 40 percent favored increased taxes and 55 percent disagreed. Billionaires, generically, garner somewhat negative ratings in the poll (35 favorable - 44 unfavorable).  Mere millionaires are a bit more popular (41 favorable - 39 unfavorable).  One in five voters is unable to give an opinion of either millionaires or billionaires. Views among groups Twice as many Democrats (40 percent) as Republicans (15 percent) feel positively about socialism. Republicans (67 percent) are more likely than Democrats (50 percent) to have a favorable view of capitalism. Men are 26 points more likely than women to have a favorable view of capitalism (70 vs. 44 percent).  That gender gap disappears on socialism, as roughly equal numbers of men (29 percent) and women (27 percent) feel positively. Voters ages 65 and over are far more likely than those under age 35 to like capitalism (72 vs. 44 percent), and young voters are more than twice as likely as seniors to have a favorable view of socialism (35 vs. 16 percent).

"                          Lawyers for the House Judiciary Committee say they're not ruling out impeaching President Trump again; Mark Meredith reports from Washington. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia is set to rehear the lawsuit launched by House Democrats to enforce a subpoena against former White House Counsel Don McGahn. The appeals court granted the Democrat-led House Judiciary Committee&apos;s request to rehear the lawsuit en banc. Oral arguments are scheduled for April 28. A three-judge panel ruled against the committee&apos;s efforts to force McGahn to testify, dealing a blow to House Democrats in litigation they have been pursuing since shortly after former Special Counsel Robert Mueller&apos;s report on Russian election interference was released. The committee hopes a hearing before all 11 judges on the circuit court will give it a more favorable result. APPEALS COURT DISMISSES DEM EFFORT TO FORCE EX-WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL DON MCGAHN TO TESTIFY ""The Committee’s petition argues that the panel’s ruling misread binding precedent and – if allowed to stand – would severely undermine the House’s ability to perform its constitutional functions as a check on the Executive Branch,"" Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said in a statement Friday. He added: ""In fact, none other than President Trump’s own lawyers told the American people over and over again during the impeachment trial that the House should have gone to court to enforce its subpoenas. In addition, two of the three judges on the panel strongly suggested that they would reject President Trump’s claim of &apos;absolute immunity&apos; if they were able to reach the merits of the case."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In the Mueller report released last April, McGahn was supposedly a central witness to alleged attempts by President Trump to obstruct justice in the investigation — including one incident where McGahn supposedly stymied an attempt by Trump to fire Mueller himself by threatening to resign if Trump went through with it. McGahn played a key role in the White House&apos;s legal operations, including the nominations and confirmations of Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. The Judiciary Committee subpoenaed McGahn about a month after the report&apos;s release, but the Trump administration claimed that McGahn had absolute immunity from being forced to testify to congressional investigators.

"                          Reaction and analysis from former deputy assistant attorney general John Yoo. In a sign of these volatile times, President Trump’s Oval Office speech wasn’t even the most noteworthy thing that happened that hour. In rapid succession, starting at 9 p.m. eastern Wednesday, Tom Hanks revealed that he and his wife have the coronavirus, and the NBA suspended its season after one player tested positive. By the next morning, the stock market continued to crater, forcing a second automatic trading halt, as the Dow plunged another 2,300 points—capping a collapse that wiped out more than 80 percent of its gains during the Trump years. JOURNALISTS FEAR CONTRACTING VIRUS AS COVERAGE INCREASINGLY CRITICIZED And by yesterday afternoon, the NCAA had pulled the plug on the March Madness tournament. Major League Baseball had canceled spring training and delayed Opening Day by at least two weeks. The NHL had also frozen the hockey season. This may well be the new normal, as everyone in America struggles to cope with a pandemic that has altered our lives in ways large and small. The media, which have also been deeply affected, is scrambling just to keep pace with the breakneck pace of developments. It’s really no longer a question of whether journalists are hyping the virus, it’s a business trying to shovel out information that is changing hour by hour. The sports cancellations may be a blow to fans, but the mushrooming wave of colleges sending students packing (in favor of online classes) is disrupting the lives of countless families. Some public school systems are taking, or weighing, similar steps. And Broadway is shutting down, at least until the middle of April. Who thought we’d be living in a world where states like New York and California are banning gatherings of more than 250 or 500 people? Or where the Capitol and White House would announce yesterday that they’re essentially closed to the public? For all the personal hardships and inconveniences, a news flash like Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson announcing they have the virus—from Australia, where he’s filming an Elvis Presley movie—is more than a gossip item. Hanks is a beloved figure who played Mr. Rogers without being out of character. But more than that, as the first celebrity to contract the disease, he is now the face of the virus crisis. And it was easier for the couple to get tested in Sydney than it would have been in the States. SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE&apos;S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY&apos;S HOTTEST STORIES This has gotten personal, as well, for the people who cover the story. The Washington Post and New York Times are encouraging staffers to work at home. CBS has shut down its New York headquarters after two confirmed cases. The network morning shows, late-night shows, and other programs like “The View” have dropped their studio audiences. So when Trump delivered his White House speech, he was confronting a threat that goes well beyond political warfare. It is now a cultural calamity. The president’s sober tone was good, a significant departure from many earlier comments in which he minimized the impact of the virus and blamed public concern on the media and the Democrats. But the steps he announced were limited, and he didn’t really address the lack of widespread testing that people across the spectrum agree has been the most significant failure in this mess. What really undercut the Trump speech were the hasty corrections afterwards, such as that the 30-day ban on travel from Europe doesn’t apply to American citizens or residents, or to trade between the countries. How does what was arguably the most important address of his presidency not get vetted more carefully than that? Maybe no presidential speech could have totally calmed the country. Perhaps no words from Washington could stop a Wall Street slide that reflects global economic damage. But there is a deep sense of unease in the country that transcends politics, one that isn’t likely to fade any time soon.

"                          Former Vice President Joe Biden swept to victory in Michigan's pivotal primary contest Tuesday, capturing four more states; Biden deputy campaign manager and communications director Kate Bedingfield discusses Biden's biggest challenge as campaign rolls on. I’ll be brief. In the spirit of Joe Biden now giving seven-minute speeches—the better to limit possible gaffes—I will be as terse as possible in assessing the Democratic race. I won’t say it’s over. The reason is that too many people in my profession declared Biden a dead man walking in what now looks like a spectacular failure of judgment. And the entire media and political establishment said there was no flippin’ way that Donald Trump was going to beat Hillary Clinton. But do I see much daylight for a possible Bernie comeback? As hard as I might squint, it’s very difficult. JOURNALISTS FEAR CONTRACTING VIRUS AS COVERAGE INCREASINGLY CRITICIZED When Biden routed Sanders in Michigan, where the democratic socialist had made a last stand of sorts, it was clear he was headed for another big night of Super Tuesday proportions. He clobbered Sanders in Missouri and Mississippi. He even won Idaho. And while Biden lost North Dakota, the fact that he’s trailing by a fraction of a percent in Washington state is a remarkable comeback by itself. And Biden replicated his stunning coalition of blacks, working-class whites, women, suburbanites and older voters, losing only younger people excited by Bernie’s sweeping and costly agenda. So when Sanders called in the media yesterday afternoon, there was understandable speculation that he might be dropping out. He admitted that he is losing the delegate race as well as the electability argument, but said he’d fight on, starting with Sunday’s CNN debate. And he took no questions. The problem for Bernie is that he’s fighting on unfavorable turf—he’ll most likely get pounded next week in Florida and Georgia—which makes it even more difficult to close the gap in delegates. The Washington Post headline on Dan Balz’s analysis: “Biden Appears to be on an unstoppable march to the nomination.” The always measured Balz writes that “barring something unforeseen, Democrats now know that former vice president Joe Biden will be the party’s nominee to challenge President Trump in November…there is little to give Sanders any confidence that he can reverse the trends enough to overtake the surging Biden.” SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE&apos;S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY&apos;S HOTTEST STORIES Politico is even more definitive: “In every way other than mathematically, his presidential campaign is done.” The piece says that for the first time the Sanders camp has no excuse, since Elizabeth Warren dropped out and he got the two-man contest he’s long wanted. The New York Times says this of Biden’s “dominant position”: “So thorough is Mr. Biden’s hold on the party now that any collapse would probably require a political U-turn as sharp as the one that precipitated his rise.” And the Atlantic headline on Ron Brownstein’s piece simply says, “It’s Over.” I did get the impression from Bernie’s tone yesterday that he’s playing out the string. As a veteran politician, he must know he faces Mission Impossible and is trying to extend his time in the spotlight to argue for his ideas. And Biden faces his own set of pressures, to win over Bernie supporters for the fall campaign. One last point—I know, I’m almost done—comes from Times conservative columnist Ross Douthat. He says the coronavirus boosted Joe, that with this burgeoning crisis there is “a flight to safety, the surrender of grand plans and big ambitions in favor of a desire to just survive. Michigan voted for Biden overwhelmingly for the same reason that both Biden and Sanders canceled rallies just before the vote — because this is now the coronavirus election, against whose stark existential stakes all normal political battles must give way.” I think there’s something to that. A crisis like what the WHO now calls a pandemic leads people to want to play it safe, and whether the criticism of President Trump is warranted or not, they find a former vice president more reassuring than a maverick preaching revolution. Okay, I’m done. Thank you all for coming.

"                          The coronavirus is causing major adjustments to the Democratic presidential contest for former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy reports. WASHINGTON — As the two remaining Democratic presidential candidates return to the debate stage, their party, the stakes, and the world look much different than in their last meeting less than three weeks ago. The fast-moving coronavirus was something of an afterthought in that debate; now the escalating crisis is likely to dominate Sunday’s contest. Rising infections in the United States and around the world have prompted a dramatic slowdown of global travel, upended financial markets, and raised questions about President Donald Trump’s ability to lead the nation through a prolonged period of uncertainty. Just two Democrats — former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders — remain to make the case that they are best-positioned to challenge Trump in November. Five other candidates who joined them on stage in the Feb. 25 debate in South Carolina have dropped out, with many rallying behind Biden’s surging candidacy.

They’ll aim to draw a contrast with Trump, but also with each other, arguing that they have the right experience, temperament and policy prescriptions to lead the nation through a crisis. “Moments like these don’t come around often in campaigns and this is a perfect opportunity to show millions that you have what it takes,” said Robert Gibbs, former White House press secretary and campaign adviser to President Barack Obama. “They must show voters they are the answer to what is missing right now by being calm, honest, ready to lead and empathetic.” ""This is a perfect opportunity to show millions that you have what it takes."" The coronavirus crisis rapidly upended plans for Sunday’s debate. First, the Democratic National Committee announced that it would hold the contest without a live audience. Then the debate was moved from a large venue in Arizona, one of the states holding a primary Tuesday, to a television studio in Washington because of concerns about cross-country travel. One of the moderators had to withdraw because of potential exposure to a person who tested positive for coronavirus. It is Biden who will step on stage as the front-runner, a distinction that seemed unlikely just a few weeks ago. After disappointing showings in the early contests, Biden roared back with a commanding victory in South Carolina and has continued to rack up wins across the country, winning broad and diverse coalitions of voters. Moderate Democratic leaders, including former rivals Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, have rallied behind his candidacy and voters have done the same. Advisers say Biden will aim in Sunday's debate to show voters who backed Sanders or other liberal candidates that they have a home in his campaign. In one overture to liberals, Biden announced his support for a bankruptcy plan championed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who ended her campaign earlier this month and has yet to endorse. In a virtual town hall on Friday, Biden said his support for Warren's proposal, which aims to simplify the bankruptcy process, is ""one of the things that I think Bernie and I will agree on."" Biden holds a solid lead over Sanders in the all-important delegate race, and a strong showing in Tuesday’s primary contests could effectively guarantee his nomination. Four big states will be up for grabs: Illinois, Ohio, Arizona and Florida, a perennial general election battleground where Biden appears to have an edge over Sanders. After a strong start, the race has moved rapidly away from Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist with a loyal following among young voters and liberals. But he’s failed to expand his appeal, particularly among black voters, and his calls for a sweeping political and economic revolution have also fallen flat with suburban voters. Sanders is facing some pressure from within the Democratic Party to step aside and allow Biden take Trump on one-on-one. Several Democratic groups that were waiting to endorse until after the primary have consolidated around Biden, including super PAC Priorities USA. Sanders’ advisers say he is a realist about his current standing and the difficulty of the path ahead. Yet the senator is pledging to grill Biden in Sunday’s debate on his plans for tackling college debt, for his past support of the Iraq war and for his backing of multilateral trade agreements. “I’m going to ask Joe Biden, I mean Joe is part of the establishment for a very long time, ‘Joe, what role have you played in trying to make sure that we end this massive level of income and wealth inequality where three people own more wealth than the bottom half of America?"" Sanders said Saturday during an online “fireside chat” with supporters. Yet it’s unclear if the issues Sanders is aiming to highlight will resonate with voters at a time when much of the nation’s focus has shifted to the growing toll of the coronavirus and put a spotlight on the need for presidential leadership. Schools and businesses across the country are closed, and many hospitals and clinics are struggling to obtain tests for the coronavirus. For Biden, the outbreak of a global pandemic has been a moment to bolster the central argument of his candidacy: that his eight years as vice president give him the experience, as well as the relationships in Washington and around the world, that are needed in the Oval Office during turbulent times. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE With campaign rallies halted because of warnings against large gatherings, Biden delivered a speech in front of reporters and advisers on his proposal for combating coronavirus, including guaranteeing free testing. Sanders’ later announced his own speech, which focused largely on advocating for his call to overhaul the nation’s health insurance system and replace it with a Medicare for All program. After Sunday’s debate, it’s unclear where the candidates and the campaign go from here. Neither Biden or Sanders has announced any public rallies for next week or given any indication of when they may be able to appear in person for voters again.

""This statement is in response to several false claims circulating online,"" a city press release read on Friday. ""To be clear, there is currently no firearm ban and no intent to seize property or close businesses. Additionally, there are no restrictions on the sale of alcohol or gas or the ability to enter or leave Champaign.""

""The ordinance in Champaign serves as a warning bell to law-abiding gun owners nationwide.  We must be on high alert for any attempts to destroy the Second Amendment in jurisdictions throughout the country,"" the alert read. The city said in its press release that municipal code has authorized a variety of powers since 2006. ""The Mayor has the authority to exercise other emergency powers under the Champaign Municipal Code Section 12-39, which have been in existence since 2006; however, and under the known circumstances, no further measures are anticipated,"" the city said.

"                           Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, has officially started serving as Ranking Member on the House Judiciary Committee, placing one of the president's most vocal defenders on a key committee before the 2020 elections. The Judiciary Committee announced on Friday that Jordan had taken over the position from Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., who was required, according to GOP conference rules, to step down as he pursues a Senate bid. At the beginning of February, the House GOP Steering Committee approved Jordan's new position in a ""totally unified decision all around,"" House GOP Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., reportedly said. Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., another vocal Trump supporter, is slated to take over Jordan's previous position as Ranking Member on the House Oversight Committee. Jordan entered Congress in 2007 and made a name for himself for, among other things, his fiery confrontations during hearings and his efforts investigating the 2011 attack on the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi, Libya. TRUMP ALLIES JORDAN, MEADOWS SELECTED FOR TOP HOUSE GOP COMMITTEE ROLES The Judiciary Committee was an integral part of Congress' attempts to investigate President Trump on several issues, including his July 25 phone call with the president of Ukraine. That incident led to an impeachment inquiry and ultimately, an acquittal in the U.S. Senate. Democrats have already indicated that they'll continue the Russia investigation in Congress as well as revisit impeachment, despite the Senate's acquittal. Both Jordan and Meadows served on the president's legal team during impeachment proceedings. As ranking member, Jordan will be in a key position to combat Democratic efforts to continue pursuing the president on issues like the Russia investigation. HOUSE PASSES BIPARTISAN FISA REFORMS TO PREVENT FUTURE 'SPYING' ABUSES Jordan has been a proponent of FISA reforms, claiming that the Justice Department illegally surveilled the president's adviser, Carter Page, during the 2016 election cycle.

"                          President Donald Trump and coronavirus task force team give updates on the disease in a White House briefing. The Trump administration will extend its European travel ban to include the U.K. and Ireland as part of continuing efforts to combat the coronavirus pandemic, President Trump said Saturday, before saying he was also looking at the possibility of domestic travel restrictions as well. “We are looking at it very seriously, yeah, because they’ve had a little bit of activity unfortunately,” he said when asked in the White House briefing room about reports that the European travel ban would be extended. “So we’re going to be looking at that -- we actually already have looked at it and that is going to be announced.” Asked if he was considering any domestic travel restrictions, Trump said: ""Yes, specifically from certain areas, yes we are."" ""We're working with the states and we're considering other restrictions, yes,"" he said. Vice President Mike Pence confirmed later in the briefing that the travel from U.K. and Ireland would be suspended as of midnight Monday night EDT. He said it was after the unanimous recommendation from health experts at the White House. EUROPEAN UNION LASHES OUT AT TRUMP OVER TRAVEL BAN AMID CORONAVIRUS CHAOS Pence emphasized that Americans currently abroad will be allowed to return home, but will be tested for the virus on their return through certain, limited airports. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said that it specifically applies to foreign nationals who have been in the U.K. or Ireland in the last 14 days and that it does not apply to U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents and foreign diplomats. It also does not apply to cargo. Wolf also said that major cruise lines have agreed to suspend outbound trips for 30 days, that smaller lines had followed suit, and that in some limited cases the government had given orders to ""a small handful"" to not sail. Those restrictions began late Friday, he said. As for whether the administration is considering travel restrictions within the U.S., Pence referred back to Trump's remarks and said ""we're considering a broad range of measures, but no decisions have been made yet."" Trump announced late Wednesday that travel from Europe would be restricted for 30 days -- but he initially exempted the U.K. and Ireland. The Department of Homeland Security went on to clarify that the ban affects most foreign nationals who were in Europe’s passport-free “Schengen Area” within 14 days prior to traveling to the U.S. On Saturday, officials did not explicitly say whether the U.K. and Ireland ban would be subjected to the same 30-day timeframe as the broader ban. The area in question consists of 26 countries, including France, Italy, German, Greece, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Norway, and Sweden. The Trump administration had slapped a travel ban on foreign nationals who had visited China and Iran last month. “The U.K. basically has got the border, strong borders and they're doing a very good job, they don't have much infection and hopefully they'll keep it that way,” he said when asked why the U.K. had been exempt. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is a close ally of Trump, who has in turn supported Johson's push to take Britain out of the European Union. Critics had questioned whether Britain’s exemption was politically motivated. The move also provoked anger from European leaders, who said they weren’t consulted and that the global pandemic requires “cooperation rather than unilateral action.” “The European Union disapproves of the fact that the U.S. decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation,” EU Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement. “The European Union is taking strong action to limit the spread of the virus.” In a sign of the increasing measures being taken across the country to protect the public from the coronavirus, all members of the media had their temperatures taken before the briefing -- and one journalist was turned away. Trump said he had his temperature taken as well, and also said he had been tested for the virus.

NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS DEMOCRATIC CAUCUSES: HERE ARE THE DELEGATES AT STAKE  An island chain in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, the Northern Mariana Islands is one of several U.S. territories that the Republican and Democratic parties give a say in choosing the presidential nominees, even though its citizens can't vote in presidential elections. Sanders emerged as the frontrunner in the early primary contests, but Biden soon overtook him as the primary field narrowed and the race moved to more diverse states. The former VP racked up major wins in Super Tuesday and Super Tuesday 2.0 this week. Nola Hix, chair of the U.S. territory's Democratic Party, said 134 people caucused Saturday on the Pacific island chain of about 53,000 people.

"                          Rep. Mark Green and Rep. Buddy Carter react to the White House's coronavirus response. In the past few days, we may have seen the real shape of the November general election. If this is accurate, the Democrats have a much deeper reason to be nervous than they currently imagine. There have been two vivid images of an incumbent president confronting a national crisis and a Democratic challenger issuing a dishonest commercial – which even The Washington Post denounced – while giving a widely panned speech on the coronavirus. To be fair to former Vice President Joe Biden, there was no way a speech at the Hotel du Pont was going to visually compete with an Oval Office address and a White House Rose Garden press conference. JAMES CARAFANO: TRUMP’S CORONAVIRUS NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION ALLOWS US TO ESCALATE WAR ON VIRUS There was also no way that a candidate standing by himself could compete with a president of the United States surrounded by the heads of major corporations like Walmart, CVS, Target, and others as they all pledged to work with the president to help solve a national emergency. In terms of sheer impact, nothing Biden could do could lead to the 1,900-point jump in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Callista and I were watching the press conference, and Fox News had a small box with the Dow Jones numbers going up, and up and up. It was every president’s dream of real-time validation that made a joke out of the Biden attack speech. However, Biden had two additional problems. First, the Biden campaign released an ad that so distorted President Trump’s record that The Washington Post gave it four Pinocchios. As Meg Kelly wrote in the newspaper’s Fact Checker column: “Ultimately, the seriousness of the coronavirus outbreak, the fact that Trump had clarified his comments on the matter before the ad was released, and the blatant way the Biden camp isolated his remarks about the American Dream pushed us to Four Pinocchios. Campaigns must be willing to make their case without resorting to video manipulation.” BRIT HUME WARNS BIDEN'S GAFFES SUGGEST FORMER VP 'IS LOSING HIS MEMORY AND IS GETTING SENILE' Biden’s speech got almost as negative a review as the campaign ad. As Collin Anderson wrote in the Washington Free Beacon: “Biden deployed an already-debunked Democratic talking point in Thursday remarks aimed at showcasing his own ability to lead the country through the crisis. The former vice president falsely stated that the Trump administration has cut investments in global health, a claim the Washington Post’s fact-checker rated ‘Three Pinocchios’ just days ago.” Biden said that the Trump administration slashed investment in the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-led package aimed at strengthening health initiatives abroad. This is a lie – and a sloppy one. The program is fully funded in President Trump’s proposed 2021 budget. In fact, the budget increases the program budget from $125 million to $175 million. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER So the contrast is clear. On the one hand, there is a commander in chief leading the American people in a dual-front campaign to defeat a virus and relaunch a remarkably successful economy. On the other hand, there is a tired, inaccurate, and at times dishonest candidate attacking the president on behalf of a campaign while the president is fighting on behalf of the country. The steady shrinking of former Vice President Biden will continue. Consider Marc Thiessen’s Washington Post column: “It’s fair to speculate whether Biden is mentally fit to be president."" Thiessen is not alone. On Tuesday, Fox News senior analyst, Brit Hume, said on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" that Biden could be “losing his memory and is getting senile."" Biden has a long history of putting his foot in his mouth, but Hume said Biden’s recent hiccups and mistakes on the campaign trail were beyond his normal quaint goofiness. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “‘More recently, however, he's begun to forget things,’ Hume added. ‘He didn't know what state he's in, he couldn't remember where he was when he met the Parkland [Florida] students, when he said he was in the White House. … I think that over time, the danger for him [Biden] and for his party is that he may say something that’s so outlandish and so suggestive that his cognitive faculties have failed him, that Democratic voters are going to say, ‘Oh, my Lord, what have we got here?’"" At this rate, President Trump will not be running against Joe Biden. President Trump is running against a virus and an economic slowdown. If he wins, he will grow into an even more historic figure of great accomplishment for most Americans. Meanwhile, Biden will shrink to irrelevancy and the election will be a landslide for President Trump. To read, hear, and watch more of Newt Gingrich’s commentary, visit Gingrich360.com.

Joe Biden&apos;s first ""virtual town hall"" was marred with technical gaffes and confusion, and ended after only five minutes. The former vice president had to cancel his Friday rally in Chicago over coronavirus concerns, and his campaign sought to connect with Illinois voters online instead. The event was broadcast live on Facebook and conducted with Zoom, a business videoconferencing app. It got off to a confusing start with the presidential hopeful starting his remarks before the camera started recording. As he prepared to take a phone question from ""Maureen"" the line went dead. ""You there?"" Biden asked. PRESIDENT TRUMP REVEALS HE TOOK CORONAVIRUS TEST At another point, Biden answered a question on endangered species by turning away from the camera and walking off the screen. Less than five minutes in, the town hall abruptly ended, and Biden and his aide apologized for the problems. ""I&apos;m sorry this has been such a disjointed effort here because of the connections. ... There&apos;s a lot more to say, but I&apos;ve already probably said too much to you,"" Biden said, holding a smartphone in his hand. The botched event got some tough reviews. ""Joe, you need a new technical team. They&apos;re making you look bad...,"" commented one Facebook user, Amanda Turbyfill Martin, on Biden&apos;s page. ""No level of technical team can stop someone from wandering confused out of the camera frame cause they forgot it was a live feed,"" added another user, Jake Perkins. Biden and rival Sen. Bernie Sanders have suspended large gatherings over concerns about spreading the virus as the primary race continues with a debate Sunday night and more voting Tuesday. Sanders, I-Vt., acknowledged Friday that fears about the spread of coronavirus have damaged his ability to leverage large rallies into support at the polls, and suggested that future Democratic presidential primary voting should be delayed if health officials recommend doing so. “We do more rallies than anybody else, and (they&apos;re) often very well-attended. I love to do them,"" the senator told reporters at a hotel in his home state of Vermont. “This coronavirus has obviously impacted our ability to communicate with people in the traditional way that we do. That&apos;s hurting.” Thousands of people gathering to hear him speak has defined Sanders since he first sought the White House in 2016. But the practice has been curtailed as health officials attempt to slow the virus&apos; spread. Instead, Sanders has convened the media for three straight days to blast the Trump administration over its handling of the pandemic, warning of dire impacts on the economy and human health. Despite trailing Biden in the delegate race, Sanders has given no indication he&apos;ll drop out.

"                          The coronavirus is causing major adjustments to the Democratic presidential contest for former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy reports. WASHINGTON — As the two remaining Democratic presidential candidates return to the debate stage, their party, the stakes, and the world look much different than in their last meeting less than three weeks ago. The fast-moving coronavirus was something of an afterthought in that debate; now the escalating crisis is likely to dominate Sunday’s contest. Rising infections in the United States and around the world have prompted a dramatic slowdown of global travel, upended financial markets, and raised questions about President Donald Trump’s ability to lead the nation through a prolonged period of uncertainty. Just two Democrats — former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders — remain to make the case that they are best-positioned to challenge Trump in November. Five other candidates who joined them on stage in the Feb. 25 debate in South Carolina have dropped out, with many rallying behind Biden’s surging candidacy. GEORGIA POSTPONES PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARIES OVER CORONAVIRUS FEARS For both Biden and Sanders, the debate is a moment to display their leadership skills in front of what could be one of the largest audiences of the primary. They’ll aim to draw a contrast with Trump, but also with each other, arguing that they have the right experience, temperament and policy prescriptions to lead the nation through a crisis. “Moments like these don’t come around often in campaigns and this is a perfect opportunity to show millions that you have what it takes,” said Robert Gibbs, former White House press secretary and campaign adviser to President Barack Obama. “They must show voters they are the answer to what is missing right now by being calm, honest, ready to lead and empathetic.” ""This is a perfect opportunity to show millions that you have what it takes."" The coronavirus crisis rapidly upended plans for Sunday’s debate. First, the Democratic National Committee announced that it would hold the contest without a live audience. Then the debate was moved from a large venue in Arizona, one of the states holding a primary Tuesday, to a television studio in Washington because of concerns about cross-country travel. One of the moderators had to withdraw because of potential exposure to a person who tested positive for coronavirus. It is Biden who will step on stage as the front-runner, a distinction that seemed unlikely just a few weeks ago. After disappointing showings in the early contests, Biden roared back with a commanding victory in South Carolina and has continued to rack up wins across the country, winning broad and diverse coalitions of voters. Moderate Democratic leaders, including former rivals Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, have rallied behind his candidacy and voters have done the same. Advisers say Biden will aim in Sunday&apos;s debate to show voters who backed Sanders or other liberal candidates that they have a home in his campaign. In one overture to liberals, Biden announced his support for a bankruptcy plan championed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who ended her campaign earlier this month and has yet to endorse. In a virtual town hall on Friday, Biden said his support for Warren&apos;s proposal, which aims to simplify the bankruptcy process, is ""one of the things that I think Bernie and I will agree on."" Biden holds a solid lead over Sanders in the all-important delegate race, and a strong showing in Tuesday’s primary contests could effectively guarantee his nomination. Four big states will be up for grabs: Illinois, Ohio, Arizona and Florida, a perennial general election battleground where Biden appears to have an edge over Sanders. After a strong start, the race has moved rapidly away from Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist with a loyal following among young voters and liberals. But he’s failed to expand his appeal, particularly among black voters, and his calls for a sweeping political and economic revolution have also fallen flat with suburban voters. Sanders is facing some pressure from within the Democratic Party to step aside and allow Biden take Trump on one-on-one. Several Democratic groups that were waiting to endorse until after the primary have consolidated around Biden, including super PAC Priorities USA. Sanders’ advisers say he is a realist about his current standing and the difficulty of the path ahead. Yet the senator is pledging to grill Biden in Sunday’s debate on his plans for tackling college debt, for his past support of the Iraq war and for his backing of multilateral trade agreements. “I’m going to ask Joe Biden, I mean Joe is part of the establishment for a very long time, ‘Joe, what role have you played in trying to make sure that we end this massive level of income and wealth inequality where three people own more wealth than the bottom half of America?"" Sanders said Saturday during an online “fireside chat” with supporters. Yet it’s unclear if the issues Sanders is aiming to highlight will resonate with voters at a time when much of the nation’s focus has shifted to the growing toll of the coronavirus and put a spotlight on the need for presidential leadership. Schools and businesses across the country are closed, and many hospitals and clinics are struggling to obtain tests for the coronavirus. For Biden, the outbreak of a global pandemic has been a moment to bolster the central argument of his candidacy: that his eight years as vice president give him the experience, as well as the relationships in Washington and around the world, that are needed in the Oval Office during turbulent times. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE With campaign rallies halted because of warnings against large gatherings, Biden delivered a speech in front of reporters and advisers on his proposal for combating coronavirus, including guaranteeing free testing. Sanders’ later announced his own speech, which focused largely on advocating for his call to overhaul the nation’s health insurance system and replace it with a Medicare for All program. After Sunday’s debate, it’s unclear where the candidates and the campaign go from here. Neither Biden or Sanders has announced any public rallies for next week or given any indication of when they may be able to appear in person for voters again.

The Judiciary Committee announced on Friday that Jordan had taken over the position from Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., who was required, according to GOP conference rules, to step down as he pursues a Senate bid. At the beginning of February, the House GOP Steering Committee approved Jordan&apos;s new position in a ""totally unified decision all around,"" House GOP Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., reportedly said. Rep.

TRUMP ALLIES JORDAN, MEADOWS SELECTED FOR TOP HOUSE GOP COMMITTEE ROLES The Judiciary Committee was an integral part of Congress&apos; attempts to investigate President Trump on several issues, including his July 25 phone call with the president of Ukraine. That incident led to an impeachment inquiry and ultimately, an acquittal in the U.S. Senate. Democrats have already indicated that they&apos;ll continue the Russia investigation in Congress as well as revisit impeachment, despite the Senate&apos;s acquittal.

"                          President Donald Trump and coronavirus task force team give updates on the disease in a White House briefing. The Trump administration will extend its European travel ban to include the U.K. and Ireland as part of continuing efforts to combat the coronavirus pandemic, President Trump said Saturday, before saying he was also looking at the possibility of domestic travel restrictions as well. “We are looking at it very seriously, yeah, because they’ve had a little bit of activity unfortunately,” he said when asked in the White House briefing room about reports that the European travel ban would be extended. “So we’re going to be looking at that -- we actually already have looked at it and that is going to be announced.” Asked if he was considering any domestic travel restrictions, Trump said: ""Yes, specifically from certain areas, yes we are."" ""We&apos;re working with the states and we&apos;re considering other restrictions, yes,"" he said. Vice President Mike Pence confirmed later in the briefing that the travel from U.K. and Ireland would be suspended as of midnight Monday night EDT. He said it was after the unanimous recommendation from health experts at the White House. EUROPEAN UNION LASHES OUT AT TRUMP OVER TRAVEL BAN AMID CORONAVIRUS CHAOS Pence emphasized that Americans currently abroad will be allowed to return home, but will be tested for the virus on their return through certain, limited airports. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said that it specifically applies to foreign nationals who have been in the U.K. or Ireland in the last 14 days and that it does not apply to U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents and foreign diplomats. It also does not apply to cargo. Wolf also said that major cruise lines have agreed to suspend outbound trips for 30 days, that smaller lines had followed suit, and that in some limited cases the government had given orders to ""a small handful"" to not sail. Those restrictions began late Friday, he said. As for whether the administration is considering travel restrictions within the U.S., Pence referred back to Trump&apos;s remarks and said ""we&apos;re considering a broad range of measures, but no decisions have been made yet."" Trump announced late Wednesday that travel from Europe would be restricted for 30 days -- but he initially exempted the U.K. and Ireland. The Department of Homeland Security went on to clarify that the ban affects most foreign nationals who were in Europe’s passport-free “Schengen Area” within 14 days prior to traveling to the U.S. On Saturday, officials did not explicitly say whether the U.K. and Ireland ban would be subjected to the same 30-day timeframe as the broader ban. The area in question consists of 26 countries, including France, Italy, German, Greece, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Norway, and Sweden. The Trump administration had slapped a travel ban on foreign nationals who had visited China and Iran last month. “The U.K. basically has got the border, strong borders and they&apos;re doing a very good job, they don&apos;t have much infection and hopefully they&apos;ll keep it that way,” he said when asked why the U.K. had been exempt. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is a close ally of Trump, who has in turn supported Johson&apos;s push to take Britain out of the European Union. Critics had questioned whether Britain’s exemption was politically motivated. The move also provoked anger from European leaders, who said they weren’t consulted and that the global pandemic requires “cooperation rather than unilateral action.” “The European Union disapproves of the fact that the U.S. decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation,” EU Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement. “The European Union is taking strong action to limit the spread of the virus.” In a sign of the increasing measures being taken across the country to protect the public from the coronavirus, all members of the media had their temperatures taken before the briefing -- and one journalist was turned away. Trump said he had his temperature taken as well, and also said he had been tested for the virus.

On the entertainment side of the business, TMZ reports that “Jeopardy!” and “Wheel of Fortune” have decided to tape their shows without a live studio audience. One reported concern is the weakened immune system of “Jeopardy!” host Alex Trebek, who is battling Stage 4 cancer. It’s hard to be in journalism without personal contact with people–whether it’s covering rallies or debates, flying on Air Force One, or getting out and interviewing people--but we all need to rethink our daily routines. And what about the party conventions in July and August? Will they come off as planned if the virus is spreading at anything like the rate it is today? Will many of the 15,000 journalists who generally attend decide to pass up Milwaukee and Charlotte? There are more subtle effects as well. It’s one thing to be reporting and writing about coronavirus in China, Italy, or the Seattle suburbs. It’s another thing when people you actually know are contracting the virus, and adds to the sense that the disease is dangerously spreading. And this comes at a time when the news business is under fire—by critics ranging from Trump to Dr. Drew—for unnecessarily scaring people about the magnitude of the threat. (The press, in turn, regularly lambastes Trump for underplaying the situation.) Some bomb-throwers like CNBC commentator Rick Santelli aren’t helping. He called for everyone in America to be infected with the virus to get it over with. “It was just a stupid thing to say,” he later admitted on “Squawk Box.” “The idea of something so absurd — I just apologize, and I apologize to everyone on this segment and all my peers at CNBC. We will get through this. We are resilient. But even if one life is affected, I do apologize for my insensitivity.”  SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE&apos;S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY&apos;S HOTTEST STORIES White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham is demanding that Vanity Fair retract a report that Trump has told aides he’s afraid that journalists will try to contract the coronavirus and give it to him on Air Force One. “False and sensational writing on this topic is irresponsible,” she said. The broader dilemma, in my view, is not so much the tone of the coverage as the relentless volume of it. There are so many angles to this global story, including the stock market plunge that culminated Monday with the largest drop since the 2008 financial crisis. Harvard kicks students out of the dorms and moves to online classes. Boston cancels its St. Patrick’s Day parade. South by Southwest is canceled. Pearl Jam cancels its concerts. Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders camce; rallies in Cleveland. New York and Florida declare states of emergency. Andrew Cuomo deploys the National Guard to a “containment zone” in a New York City suburb. There is talk of the NCAA tournament, and even the NBA, playing without fans (which LeBron James says he would boycott). And every new case, or handful of cases, gets breaking-news treatment. These and many other stories are significant and have to be covered. What’s more, there is clearly a huge public appetite for news about the virus (not to mention a thriving market of disinformation on social media, as the NYT reports). That’s why the subject is dominating cable news and the top of home pages of major newspapers. In that sense, news executives can be described as giving the public what it wants. But with America on edge, with emotions so raw, with the crisis so politicized, journalists need to think long and hard about whether their they are even inadvertently sowing the seeds of panic.

"                          Rep. Mark Green and Rep. Buddy Carter react to the White House's coronavirus response. In the past few days, we may have seen the real shape of the November general election. If this is accurate, the Democrats have a much deeper reason to be nervous than they currently imagine. There have been two vivid images of an incumbent president confronting a national crisis and a Democratic challenger issuing a dishonest commercial – which even The Washington Post denounced – while giving a widely panned speech on the coronavirus. To be fair to former Vice President Joe Biden, there was no way a speech at the Hotel du Pont was going to visually compete with an Oval Office address and a White House Rose Garden press conference. JAMES CARAFANO: TRUMP’S CORONAVIRUS NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION ALLOWS US TO ESCALATE WAR ON VIRUS There was also no way that a candidate standing by himself could compete with a president of the United States surrounded by the heads of major corporations like Walmart, CVS, Target, and others as they all pledged to work with the president to help solve a national emergency. In terms of sheer impact, nothing Biden could do could lead to the 1,900-point jump in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Callista and I were watching the press conference, and Fox News had a small box with the Dow Jones numbers going up, and up and up. It was every president’s dream of real-time validation that made a joke out of the Biden attack speech. However, Biden had two additional problems. First, the Biden campaign released an ad that so distorted President Trump’s record that The Washington Post gave it four Pinocchios. As Meg Kelly wrote in the newspaper’s Fact Checker column: “Ultimately, the seriousness of the coronavirus outbreak, the fact that Trump had clarified his comments on the matter before the ad was released, and the blatant way the Biden camp isolated his remarks about the American Dream pushed us to Four Pinocchios. Campaigns must be willing to make their case without resorting to video manipulation.” BRIT HUME WARNS BIDEN&apos;S GAFFES SUGGEST FORMER VP &apos;IS LOSING HIS MEMORY AND IS GETTING SENILE&apos; Biden’s speech got almost as negative a review as the campaign ad. As Collin Anderson wrote in the Washington Free Beacon: “Biden deployed an already-debunked Democratic talking point in Thursday remarks aimed at showcasing his own ability to lead the country through the crisis. The former vice president falsely stated that the Trump administration has cut investments in global health, a claim the Washington Post’s fact-checker rated ‘Three Pinocchios’ just days ago.” Biden said that the Trump administration slashed investment in the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-led package aimed at strengthening health initiatives abroad. This is a lie – and a sloppy one. The program is fully funded in President Trump’s proposed 2021 budget. In fact, the budget increases the program budget from $125 million to $175 million. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER So the contrast is clear. On the one hand, there is a commander in chief leading the American people in a dual-front campaign to defeat a virus and relaunch a remarkably successful economy. On the other hand, there is a tired, inaccurate, and at times dishonest candidate attacking the president on behalf of a campaign while the president is fighting on behalf of the country. The steady shrinking of former Vice President Biden will continue. Consider Marc Thiessen’s Washington Post column: “It’s fair to speculate whether Biden is mentally fit to be president."" Thiessen is not alone. On Tuesday, Fox News senior analyst, Brit Hume, said on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" that Biden could be “losing his memory and is getting senile."" Biden has a long history of putting his foot in his mouth, but Hume said Biden’s recent hiccups and mistakes on the campaign trail were beyond his normal quaint goofiness. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “‘More recently, however, he&apos;s begun to forget things,’ Hume added. ‘He didn&apos;t know what state he&apos;s in, he couldn&apos;t remember where he was when he met the Parkland [Florida] students, when he said he was in the White House. … I think that over time, the danger for him [Biden] and for his party is that he may say something that’s so outlandish and so suggestive that his cognitive faculties have failed him, that Democratic voters are going to say, ‘Oh, my Lord, what have we got here?’"" At this rate, President Trump will not be running against Joe Biden. President Trump is running against a virus and an economic slowdown. If he wins, he will grow into an even more historic figure of great accomplishment for most Americans. Meanwhile, Biden will shrink to irrelevancy and the election will be a landslide for President Trump. To read, hear, and watch more of Newt Gingrich’s commentary, visit Gingrich360.com.

"                          Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Louisiana is moving to postpone its April 4 presidential primary due to concerns over the coronavirus outbreak, state election officials announced Friday. The primary – which includes mayoral races and local propositions as well as the presidential ballot – would instead be held June 20, Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin announced at a news conference in Baton Rouge. Christina Stephens, a spokeswoman for Louisiana Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards, told Fox News the governor will sign an executive order Friday moving the election to the later date. The governor is also planning to hold a press conference in New Orleans on Friday. TRUMP TO ANNOUNCE NATIONAL EMERGENCY ON CORONAVIRUS: HERE'S WHAT THAT MEANS “The governor and the secretary of state began this discussion of delaying the primary several days ago out of concern for the aging population of poll workers and a desire to prevent the spread of illness,” Stephens said. “We are experiencing community spread of coronavirus in Louisiana and the governor is taking decisive action to slow its progress.” Louisiana is the first state that’s holding an upcoming primary or caucus to move to delay their contest.       Christina Stephens, a spokeswoman for Louisiana Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards (pictured), told Fox News the governor will sign an executive order Friday moving the election to the later date. The governor is also planning to hold a press conference in New Orleans on Friday. (AP Photo/Melinda Deslatte, File)       ""Today I have certified that a state of emergency exists and requested that the governor issue an executive order postponing the elections this spring. We have requested postponing the April 4 primary election until June 20 and postponing the May 9 general election until July 25,"" Ardoin, the secretary of state, said. ""While hurricanes, floods and tornadoes are at the forefront of all Louisianan's minds, the threat we face from the COV-19 virus is an unprecedented threat and unlike any we have faced,"" the secretary of state added. ""Safe and secure elections also mean safety to the people of Louisiana,"" he emphasized. Four states hold primaries on Tuesday – Arizona, Florida, Illinois, and Ohio. Meanwhile, Arizona's Secretary of State's office told Fox News it couldn't move the date of their primary because it would require legislative action. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP That comes as election officials in the four states are making last-minute moves -- such as moving polling places away from locations with heavy concentrations of high-risk people, like nursing homes. The secretary of states of Arizona, Florida, Illinois, and Ohio put out a joint statement emphasizing that “we are working closely with our state health officials to ensure that our poll workers and voters can be confident that voting is safe.” “Unlike concerts, sporting events or other mass gatherings where large groups of people travel long distances to congregate in a confined space for an extended period of time, polling locations see people from a nearby community coming into and out of the building for a short duration,” they noted.  And the secretary of states highlighted that “guidance from voting machine manufacturers on how best to sanitize machines, guidance from CDC on best practices for hand washing, and guidance from our respective state health officials is being provided to every polling location.” Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders - asked about the postponement of Louisiana's primary - told reporters at a press conference in his hometown of Burlington, Vermont that ""elections are the bedrock of our democracy and we don’t want to be delaying elections on a willy nilly basis."" But he stressed that ""there is obviously a growing concern about bringing people together and spreading the virus…. I don’t think there’s anybody out there – no matter what your political view may be – that wants to see people become infected because they are voting.""  Former Vice President Joe Biden’s campaign put out a statement following the move by Louisiana. “Voting is at the very heart of who we are as a democracy. As election officials working with public health officials are demonstrating throughout the country, our elections can be conducted safely in consultation with public health officials,” deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said. “If voters are feeling healthy, not exhibiting symptoms, and don’t believe they've been exposed to COVID-19, please vote on Tuesday,"" Bedingfield said of the upcoming contests. ""If voters are members of an at-risk population, exhibiting symptoms, or have been exposed to a diagnosed case of COVID-19, we encourage them to explore absentee ballots and vote by mail options.”    ",         Louisiana moves to postpone primary amid coronavirus pandemic,         2020-03-13T130433-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/louisiana-postpones-primary-amid-coronavirus-pandemic,Fox
"                          Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin joins Chris Wallace on 'Fox News Sunday.' Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Sunday that the Trump administration is not asking Congress for bailouts when it pushes for money to help protect certain American businesses disproportionately affected by the coronavirus pandemic as he sought to calm fears surrounding the volatile stock market and the effect of the coronavirus on the economy. Speaking on ""Fox News Sunday"" with Chris Wallace, Mnuchin said that he and President Trump are hoping for ""a big stimulus program because we need to help American workers now."" He specifically mentioned businesses like airlines and cruise lines within the travel industry as possible targets for stimulus funds, but told Wallace the administration does not want a bailout.

GOP SENATOR PUSHING LEGISLATION TO REDUCE PHARMACEUTICAL DEPENDENCY ON CHINA: 'WE ARE DEPENDENT ON THEM' Mnuchin said the administration's efforts will focus more on individuals than corporations. ""To the extent that we need to support different businesses that are impacted, again our focus is going to be on stimulus for the workers and getting money to the workers that are impacted,"" he said. Early Saturday morning the House of Representatives passed a coronavirus relief bill, which Mnuchin was heavily involved in negotiating and received the backing of President Trump. According to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the bill includes paid emergency leave with two weeks of paid sick leave and up to three months of paid family and medical leave. “We have also secured enhanced unemployment insurance, a step that will extend protections to furloughed workers,” she said. Pelosi also said the bill included food security measures and increased federal funds for Medicaid. Mnuchin said the Trump administration is working with the Senate to shepherd the bill through for the president's signature. ""I'm speaking to senators, I don't wanna predict, I think there's a lot of bipartisan support, I hope they pass this bill,"" Mnuchin said. If the bill cannot make it through the Senate, he said he will work to come up with a compromise bill between the GOP-controlled Senate and the Democrat-controlled House. ""Whatever we need, we are gonna get from Congress,"" he said. Also in his interview with Wallace on Sunday, Mnuchin went out of his way to ease investors' fears after a week that saw trading stopped on two separate occasions because of sharp sell-offs and the worst day for the market since 1987. Mnuchin said the drop in the market was related to the coronavirus fears. He said he was optimistic about the U.S. government's ability to stop the spread of the disease, which would eventually lead to the market getting back on track.

""People who brought stocks after the crash in [1987], people who bought stocks after the financial crisis [in 2008] did really well.

"                          Coronavirus task force member Dr. Anthony Fauci, director National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, joins Chris Wallace on 'Fox News Sunday.' Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, expressed dismay over recent scenes of Americans fleeing Europe en masse, creating significant crowds at airports during a time when people are encouraged to engage in social separation to avoid spreading coronavirus. Fauci made clear that the recent travel ban from Europe does not apply to Americans, and that people do not need to rush back to the U.S. all at once. CORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN “What people need to understand, if you’re an American citizen if you are a family member, that you can get back,"" he told ""Fox News Sunday,"" making clear that people do not need to return to the U.S. immediately. ""But it’s understandable when people see a travel ban they immediately want to hunker and get home. Hopefully we won’t see more of that but I think we probably unfortunately will see that.” During an appearance Sunday on CNN, Fauci did not rule out his support for a temporary national lockdown of restaurants and bars. He said said he'd ""like to see a dramatic diminution of the personal interaction that we see"" in social gathering spots. ""Whatever it takes to do that, that's what I'd like to see,"" Fauci told Brianna Keilar on ""State of the Union."" Fauci told Wallace that he did not think a national lockdown, similar to Italy's, would be necessary for the United States, and also discussed three reasons why coronavirus is different from other ailments like the flu. “One, it’s brand new so we don’t have any prior experience about what it’s gonna do, what it’s dynamic’s gonna be,” he said. “Number 2, it spreads very easily, there’s no doubt about that. It isn’t like some of the other outbreaks that we had that just didn’t adapt itself to spread among humans. And Number 3, it’s very serious in the sense of morbidity and mortality, particularly among – and very heavily weighted -- towards individuals who are more susceptible – the elderly and those with underlying conditions.” When asked if its contagiousness and lethality are worse than the flu, Fauci emphatically said, “Well yes, I mean it just is, and we’ve gotta face that fact.” Fauci also repeated his prediction that things “will get worse before they get better.” He remained optimistic that the impact can be mitigated, but only if people take precautions. “To think that right now everything is going to be okay if we don’t do anything, that’s absolutely incorrect,” he said. Fauci also said that a national lockdown like what has taken place in Italy will likely not be necessary in the U.S. ""We feel that with rather stringent mitigation and containment without necessarily complete lockdown we’d be able to prevent ourselves from getting to where, unfortunately, Italy is now,"" he said. Fauci also noted that domestic travel bans have “not been seriously considered.” CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP One issue that Americans have faced is the difficulty in getting tested. Fauci did not pull any punches during a House Oversight Committee hearing Thursday, in which he acknowledged the government’s “failing” when it comes to being equipped for large-scale testing, but Friday told Fox News there will be a “major escalation” now that the private sector is getting involved. He reiterated that optimism on Sunday, saying that with the involvement of private companies, in the next week it appears that even if some Americans are still not able to get tested, “the totality of the picture is going to be infinitely better than it was a few weeks ago.”    ",         Dr. Fauci explains why coronavirus is worse than flu,         2020-03-15T102231-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/fauci-explains-why-coronavirus-is-worse-than-flu-warns-against-americans-fleeing-europe-immediately,Fox
"                          Former federal inmate turned life coach Enrique Fiallo weighs in on what awaits former Trump attorney Michael Cohen in the big house. President Trump’s former personal attorney Michael Cohen has shared a petition calling for the president to have the Federal Bureau of Prisons allow prisoners like him to be released and placed under home detention during the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. The petition specifically calls for federal non-violent offenders – like Cohen -- to be sent home to free up prison resources. GOP REPS MAKE CASE FOR NEW CHARGES AGAINST EX-TRUMP LAWYER MICHAEL COHEN “The Federal Prison Camps are without adequate medical staff and are without proper medical equipment, sterilization techniques, gloves, sanitizers, masks, and other necessary items,” the petition says. It claims that placing non-violent offenders under home confinement “would give the prison facilities additional (and much needed) medical triage and logistic space for those who will become infected with the COVID-19 Virus, the spread of which is discussed as a mathematical certitude.” The greater availability of prison resources is necessary, the petition claims, because of the burdens already faced by hospitals and complications involved in transporting sick prisoners. Cohen is currently serving a three-year sentence following a 2018 guilty plea to charges including bank and tax fraud, as well as campaign finance violations related to Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. He began serving his sentence at federal facility in Otisville, N.Y., in May 2019. Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee, said in January that he wants  Cohen to face the possibility of more criminal charges for allegedly lying to Congress.

"                          A look at what's in&nbsp;Bernie Sanders' coronavirus plan Sen. Bernie Sanders seemed to suggest Sunday that this week’s Democratic presidential primaries should be postponed for safety reasons amid the rapidly spreading coronavirus outbreak. In a post-debate interview on CNN, Sanders, I-Vt., pointed to new guidelines released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention limiting gatherings to no more than 50 people over the next eight weeks as the country grapples with the highly contagious COVID-19. LOUISIANA POSTPONES PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY AMID COVID-19 PANDEMIC “I would hope that governors listen to the public health experts and what they are saying is … we don’t want gatherings of more than 50 people,” Sanders said late Sunday when asked about Tuesday's contests. “I’m thinking about some of the elderly people sitting behind the desks, registering people and doing all that stuff. Does that make sense? I’m not sure it does.” The next round of contests is scheduled Tuesday in Arizona, Illinois, Florida and Ohio. While some states are either considering postponing primaries or have already decided to do so, officials responsible for this week's contests have shown little inclination to delay -- instead stressing safety precautions in place. ""[W]e are working closely with our state health officials to ensure that our poll workers and voters can be confident that voting is safe,"" secretaries of state for those elections said in a recent statement. Based on the latest polling data, Sanders could be in for a tough night of primaries should the vote go forward as planned. According to the RealClearPolitics average for the Florida primary, Sanders is trailing former Vice President Joe Biden badly — with 22.6 percent of Floridians supporting the self-described democratic socialist to Biden’s 65.4 percent. The RealClearPolitics average shows Biden also leading with 49 percent of the vote in Arizona, to Sanders’ 27.3 percent. Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield, during a call with reporters Sunday night after the CNN/Univision-hosted debate, was asked about Sanders’ comments but wouldn’t weigh in on whether Tuesday’s contests should be postponed.

The back-and-forth over whether Tuesday’s contests will take place comes after Louisiana moved to postpone their primary, originally scheduled for April 4. That contest has been postponed to June 20, amid concerns of the spread of COVID-19. Georgia followed suit, over the weekend announcing that the state’s March 24 primary would be postponed to May 19. COVID-19 was designated by the World Health Organization as a global pandemic last week. President Trump announced a national emergency on Friday. The president also announced a temporary halt on air travel to the United States from Europe, now including flights from the United Kingdom, but excluding those carrying cargo. The announcement came as major sporting and other events were called off or postponed, businesses across the country instituted telework policies, government buildings and schools shuttered and other disruptions rocked the nation, amid efforts to curb the transmission of the virus. The Federal Reserve also slashed interest rates to near zero and said it would buy $700 billion in Treasury securities in an aggressive step to insulate the U.S. economy from the pandemic. The outbreak is believed to have originated at an animal and seafood market in the city of Wuhan, China. As of Monday morning, there were more than 3,700 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States, in 49 states, including Washington, D.C. The U.S., so far, has seen 68 coronavirus-related deaths. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to WHO, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.

"                          NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio addresses coronavirus response, gives updates. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is arguing that the best way to tackle the coronavirus outbreak is for the federal government to take over critical private companies in the medical field and have them running 24 hours a day. The mayor, who made multiple media appearances over the weekend, said that the current situation calls for drastic measures which include nationalizing certain industries. CORONAVIRUS HAS NEW YORKERS WAKING UP IN A CITY THAT NEVER SLEEPS TO BIG CHANGES  “This is a case for a nationalization, literally a nationalization, of crucial factories and industries that could produce the medical supplies to prepare this country for what we need,” de Blasio told MSNBC’s Joy Reid on Saturday, calling for “24/7 shifts” during what he called a “war-like situation.” The following day, de Blasio reiterated this message, telling CNN that “the federal government needs to take over the supply chain right now.” He specified the need for companies that make ventilators, surgical masks, and hand sanitizers to be taken over and made to work around the clock. CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE New York state already has started producing hand sanitizer in response to shortages and price gouging. The city itself has also taken drastic steps to deal with the crisis, forcing restaurants to limit themselves to takeout and delivery service, and closing many establishments to prevent the spread of the virus through crowds. The mayor predicted that coronavirus will continue to be a problem “for at least six months.” CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Sunday evening, it was announced that New York City schools will be shutting down until at least April 20, a measure de Blasio previously had resisted, despite facing pressure to do so.

"                          Sidney Powell, attorney for Gen. Michael Flynn, speaks out on 'Hannity.' The attorney for former national security adviser Michael Flynn on Monday welcomed President Trump’s apparent consideration of a pardon for her client, calling the case against him a “blight” on the justice system. The president on Sunday said he was “strongly considering” a ""full pardon"" for Flynn – whose case stemmed from the Russia probe – complaining the FBI “lost” records related to Flynn’s initial interview with federal investigators. TRUMP 'STRONGLY CONSIDERING' PARDON FOR MICHAEL FLYNN In an email to Fox News on Monday, attorney Sidney Powell expressed her team's gratitude over the president’s consideration. “General Flynn is honored by the President’s concern and awareness of this egregious injustice against him, his family, and the American people,” Powell wrote to Fox News. “Mueller-Weissman team and evil actors in the FBI and [the Department of Justice, DOJ] had to concoct case against Flynn to keep their obstruction hoax alive against the president. That’s what it was really about.” Robert Mueller served as special counsel leading the Russia probe, and Andrew Weissmann was a top member of the team. Flynn had pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI as part of that probe, and his sentencing remains in limbo. Powell went on to say that “Flynn was the tip of the spear to destroy Trump.” “This persecution is an outrage and a blight on the entire justice system,” she continued. “No one can have any trust in the FBI or DOJ until this is corrected. The first step in restoring public confidence and trust in the FBI and DOJ is giving us the truth and dismissing the prosecution of Flynn for outrageous government misconduct.” Powell has been aggressively fighting the DOJ in the case, filing a motion on Flynn’s behalf in January alleging problems that have come to light since Flynn pleaded guilty. The motion stated that there is no precise record of Flynn’s statements to agents, and that the original handwritten ""302"" witness report from the interview is “missing,” with subsequent versions later “edited.” “So now it is reported that, after destroying his life & the life of his wonderful family (and many others also), the FBI, working in conjunction with the Justice Department, has ‘lost’ the record of General Michael Flynn,” Trump tweeted Sunday. “How convenient. I am strongly considering a Full Pardon!” Flynn’s case stemmed from a January 2017 FBI interview, in which he was asked about his conversations with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements regarding those communications during his interview, as part of Mueller’s investigation, but has since reversed course. In January, Flynn and Powell moved to withdraw his guilty plea for making false statements “because of the government’s bad faith, vindictiveness and breach of the plea agreement.” DOJ TAPS OUTSIDE PROSECUTOR TO REVIEW HANDLING OF MICHAEL FLYNN CASE “The prosecution has shown abject bad faith in pure retaliation against Mr. Flynn since he retained new counsel,” Powell wrote in January. “This can only be because, with new, unconflicted counsel, Mr. Flynn refused to lie for the prosecution.” ""Michael T. Flynn is innocent. Mr. Flynn has cooperated with the government in good faith for two years. He gave the prosecution his full cooperation,"" the attorneys added. At the time, the DOJ had accused Flynn of failing to cooperate and of failing to take responsibility. “The defendant’s conduct was more than just a series of lies; it was an abuse of trust,” the DOJ wrote. But after Flynn attempted to withdraw his plea, the Justice Department offered a more lenient sentence recommendation. Federal prosecutors still seek a sentence of up to six months, but unlike before, prosecutors explicitly state that probation would be a “reasonable” punishment and that they would not oppose it. Last month, U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan ordered Flynn's sentencing hearing canceled ""until further order of the court,"" giving Flynn and federal prosecutors more time to submit filings on Flynn's request to withdraw his guilty plea, including claims he did not get sufficient legal assistance from his former legal team. Also last month, Attorney General Bill Barr tapped Jeff Jensen, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri, to review Flynn’s case. Jensen is working hand-in-hand with the lead prosecutor of Flynn’s case, an official said. The case against Flynn, a former U.S. Army lieutenant general, has gone through years of twists and turns, with sentencing postponed repeatedly over the last two years. Flynn’s supporters have insisted he is innocent.

The Supreme Court announced Monday that it will postpone oral arguments for the March session due to concerns over the coronavirus outbreak -- marking the first health crisis-related delay for such proceedings since the Spanish flu a century ago. Those arguments include cases scheduled to before the court on March 23-25 and March 30-April 1. A press release says the justices will hold their regular conference on Friday and issue their Order List on Monday, though the release says ""Some Justices may participate remotely by telephone."" The Supreme Court building was already closed to the public last week, and it will remain open for business even as the oral arguments -- which see the justices, several of whom are senior citizens, packed in the courtroom with hundreds of lawyers, activists, members of parties and journalists -- are postponed. Filing deadlines will also not be extended, according to the Supreme Court's news release. According to the court's news release, the last time the Supreme Court postponed oral arguments due to a health crisis was 1918 as the Spanish flu, which sickened U.S. President Woodrow Wilson at the time, afflicted the United States.

"                          'This is where America shines,' says Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine and professor at Baylor College of Medicine. How concerned are you about the coronavirus outbreak? The answer may depend on whether you’re a Democrat or Republican, a new national poll suggests. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey released Sunday found that just over half of Americans are worried that a family member may catch the virus that causes COVID-19, and that six in 10 say the worst is yet to come regarding the pandemic. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW But the poll – which was conducted almost entirely before President Trump declared a national emergency on Friday – points to a wide partisan divide on attitudes regarding the outbreak. Sixty-eight percent of Democrats said they were concerned that a family member could contract the virus. But that number dropped to 40 percent among Republicans. Nearly eight in 10 Democrats felt the worst was yet to come in coping with the pandemic. That number dropped in half to 40 percent among Republicans.  Six in 10 Democrats said they’ve stopped or plan to stop going to any large gatherings. That percentage dropped in half for Republicans. And 47 percent of Democrats but just 23 percent of Republicans said they were canceling or rescheduling travel plans. Spotlighting the gravity of the situation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Sunday recommended against holding gatherings of 50 people or more for the next eight weeks. The president, at a Sunday news conference, told Americans to “relax” and said “we’re doing great, it will all pass” as he urged shoppers not to hoard supplies and food at stories. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE CORONVIRUS OUTBREAK According to the poll, 45 percent of Americans gave the president a thumbs up for how he’s handling the coronavirus outbreak. But there’s a gigantic partisan divide. Eighty-one percent of Republicans but just 13 percent of Democrats approved of the job he’s doing battling the virus, with independents at 43 percent. The NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll was conducted March 11-13 (Wednesday-Friday), with 900 registered voters nationwide questioned by live telephone operators.

"                          Reaction from liberal analyst Cathy Areu and Republican strategist Ash Wright. Former Vice President Joe Biden for months has touted his more moderate positions over the more radical platform of rival Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. — but he's taken a noticeable left turn on a number of issues as he courts Sanders' progressive base and tries to lock down the nomination. Biden has even gone so far as to state he was adopting parts of plans offered by Sanders himself, as well as former presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Here's a look at the front-running Democratic primary candidate's evolving platform: MARY ANNE MARSH: IN BIDEN-SANDERS DEBATE, SOLUTIONS WIN AND REVOLUTION LOSES Free College A key feature of Sanders’ platform has been his desire to offer free college for everyone. Biden now says he’s a fan, but placed a limit on his proposal that Sanders opposes. “Bernie has put forward a plan that would make public colleges and universities free for families whose income is below $125,000. It's a good idea, and after consideration, I am proud to add it to my platform,” Biden tweeted Sunday. Sanders’ campaign noted in response that the democratic socialist’s plan does not have any income-based restrictions and calls for tuition-free college for all. “It's great that Joe Biden is now supporting a position that was in the Democratic platform four years ago,"" Sanders' team said in a statement. ""Now, we have to go much further. We need to make all public universities, colleges and trade schools tuition-free for everyone like our high schools are."" Bankruptcy In the same Twitter thread, Biden announced that he is also supporting Warren’s bankruptcy plan, which aims to simplify the bankruptcy process. “Few people in the country understand how bankruptcy hurts working families more than Elizabeth Warren,"" Biden said. ""Today, I am fully endorsing and adopting her bankruptcy plan, which she called 'Fixing Our Bankruptcy System to Give People a Second Chance.'"" Warren, in a Medium post earlier this year, said her plan would ""make it easier for people being crushed by debt to obtain relief through bankruptcy,"" ""expand people’s rights to take care of themselves and their children while they are in the bankruptcy process,"" end the ""absurd rules that make it nearly impossible to discharge student loan debt in bankruptcy,"" and ""let more people protect their homes and cars in bankruptcy so they can start from a firm foundation when they start to pick up the pieces and rebuild their financial lives."" Fracking During Sunday's debate, after Sanders discussed putting an end to all fracking, Biden responded by saying, ""No new fracking."" It was unclear at first if this was a call for a total ban on the practice going forward, but Biden's campaign later said that it was a reiteration of his previously stated position against new oil and gas drilling on federal lands. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Immigration Biden has taken a more liberal stance on illegal immigration in recent weeks, saying that if he becomes president he will impose a 100-day freeze on deportation. He also said that people who enter the U.S. illegally will not be deported unless they commit a felony on American soil, even if they have a criminal record in another country. This goes further than the policy advertised on Biden’s campaign website, which simply calls for ending “prolonged detention” as people await court hearings.

"                          Reaction from liberal analyst Cathy Areu and Republican strategist Ash Wright. Joe Biden holds a commanding lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders in Arizona, according to a new poll released on the eve of that state’s presidential primary. A Monmouth University survey released on Monday shows the former vice president with 51 percent support among likely Democratic presidential primary voters. Sanders – the populist lawmaker from Vermont who’s making his second straight White House run – stands at 31 percent.  That's 20 percentage points behind Biden. SANDERS HINTS TUESDAY'S PRIMARIES SHOULD BE POSTPONED Arizona joins Florida, Illinois and Ohio in holding Democratic nominating contests on Tuesday. As of now, officials in all four states plan to proceed with their primaries despite much of the country closing down as the coronavirus outbreak spreads. Polls in all four states indicate Biden holding double-digit leads. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii – the only other remaining candidate left in the battle for the Democratic nomination – is backed by just 1 percent. In the Biden-Sanders face-off, the poll indicates Sanders with at 48-41 percent edge among Latino voters and a large 56-28 percent lead among voters under age 50. But Biden holds a large 29-point lead among white voters and an overwhelming 48-point lead among voters age 50 and older. “Biden has a strong advantage going into the primary. This is because much of his support has already been banked in the early vote. The closure of many polling places due to COVID-19 means it is uncertain how many voters who planned to vote on Tuesday will actually show up,” Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray said in a statement. The poll suggests that just over half of likely primary voters have already cast ballots, with Biden holding a nearly two-to-one margin over Sanders among those voters. SANDERS ATTACKS BIDEN'S RECORD AS SUNDAY NIGHT'S DEBATE GETS TESTY Looking ahead to the November general election, the survey shows Biden with a slight 46-43 percent advantage over President Trump – while the Republican incumbent has a slight 44-43 percent edge over Sanders. Trump topped 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by 4 points in Arizona four years ago – and the state’s considered to be one of a handful of battleground states in the 2020 election. The Monmouth University poll was conducted March 11-14, with 847 registered voters – including 373 likely to vote in the Democratic presidential primary – questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s overall sampling error is 3.4 percentage points, with a margin of error of 5.1 percentage points for Democratic primary questions.

"                          A handful of House Democrats want U.S. attorney John Durham to step aside; reaction from Arizona Congressman Andy Biggs, Republican member of the House Judiciary Committee. U.S. Attorney John Durham is expected to wrap up his investigation into the origins of the Russia probe by the end of the summer, sources confirmed to Fox News. One source suggested the investigation could end as soon as July, while another said it could be closer to September, based on Durham's progress, which could be hindered by the coronavirus pandemic rocking the nation and the globe. TOP GOP REP SUGGESTS DURHAM PROBE WILL LEAD TO CHARGES Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, relayed the same timeline during a House Rules Committee meeting focused on reform of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act last week. “His investigation is due to be completed sometime this summer,” Jordan said. His comments were first reported by The Washington Examiner. Durham, the U.S. attorney for Connecticut, was appointed last year by Attorney General Bill Barr to review the events leading up to the 2016 presidential election and through President Trump’s January 20, 2017 inauguration. But, as Fox News first reported, Durham has since expanded his investigation to cover a post-election timeline spanning the spring of 2017—when Robert Mueller was appointed as special counsel. Last month, Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., who served as the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee but left the role after announcing a Senate campaign, told Fox News that Durham’s probe will likely lead to criminal charges. DOJ INVESTIGATES THE INVESTIGATORS: 5 INTERNAL PROBES UNDERWAY ON RUSSIA AND MORE “This is not going to be a Mueller report; there won’t be a report,” Collins told Fox News, noting that Durham and his team have kept very “quiet” about their work. “When he’s ready to charge people, he’ll charge people,” Collins told Fox News. “And that’s when we’ll know.” Collins explained that Barr had expanded Durham’s reach into the intelligence community, and added that he has “grand juries” and “everything else” at his disposal. Durham has investigated CIA officials and other officials throughout the intelligence community. Former CIA Director John Brennan has said that Durham plans to interview him and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. Those interviews have yet to take place, a source familiar with the investigation told Fox News last month.

As the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread in the United States, members of Congress and their staffs are taking precautions to ensure they do not contract the disease or spread it to others — including social distancing, testing and self-quarantine. Most recently, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., tested negative for coronavirus on Sunday after self-quarantining following a trip to President Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort — where a member of the Brazilian president's delegation spent time before later testing positive for the novel coronavirus. The veteran senator tweeted that his test was negative. ""I was just informed by [Dr. Monahan], the head of the House Physicians Office, that my coronavirus test was NEGATIVE. I am very grateful and like everyone else will follow the best practices to stay negative,"" Graham tweeted.

Two of those positive tests came Sunday night. The other was a member of Washington Sen. Maria Cantwell's staff last week. Delaware Sen. Tom Carper's office said in a press release Sunday that one member of his state staff -- meaning the person did not spend time in Washington, D.C. -- tested positive for the coronavirus and was self-quarantining. ""On the advice of Delaware public health experts at the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS), other members of Senator Carper’s staff who came in contact with the individual while the individual was exhibiting symptoms will be self-isolating at home for the next 14 days and monitoring their symptoms closely,"" the press release said. ""If any of those staff members start showing symptoms of COVID-19, they will be tested as well."" HOUSE'S CORONAVIRUS BILL MAY BE IN TROUBLE IN THE SENATE The release from Carper's office said all of his staff would begin teleworking on Monday. Arizona GOP Rep. David Schweikert announced Sunday that a member of his Capitol Hill staff tested positive. ""They are resting comfortably at home and following guidance from local health officials,"" Schweikart said in a statement Sunday. ""Given that I have interacted with the employee who tested positive, I will be working from home until otherwise told by doctors."" Schweikart is also closing both his Capitol Hill office and his office in Scottsdale, Ariz.

"                          Testing is emerging as one of the biggest issues of the coronavirus response so far. “Do not underestimate the challenge the Senate could face passing this bill.” Those were the words of a senior Republican source about how tough the path may be for the Senate to align with the House of Representatives and approve a massive coronavirus measure. There is one school of thought that the Senate could simply take up the House bill and pass it on the spot. But frankly, the course is much, much harder than that.  US SHOULD REEVALUATE RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA AFTER CORONAVIRUS, REP SAYS In fact, there are some technical problems in the drafting of the coronavirus legislation that requires the House to pass the bill again – perhaps with a skeleton staff – later this week. More on that in a moment. The House overwhelmingly okayed the emergency coronavirus package in the wee hours of Saturday morning after more than 20 phone calls between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. “What made it hard is that we could never get everyone in the same room,” said one source. In other words, social distancing contributed to a problem in the drafting of the legislation and trading of offers. Usually, the sides would lock themselves into a room and go around the table. But not in the age of coronavirus.  That prompted dozens upon dozens of phone calls between Pelosi, Mnuchin, other officials at Treasury, the White House, Republican Congressional leaders, House Committees, legislative counsel, et al. You get the idea. Don’t forget that President Woodrow Wilson fell ill with the Spanish Flu in 1919. Wilson’s bout with the flu nearly sidetracked the Treaty of Versailles to end World War I. In other words, there’s precedent for pandemics shaping the curve of negotiating some of the most important things in politics. So, the road to passage in the Senate? Unclear – even though 140 House GOPers voted for the plan in a witching hour vote Saturday morning and President Trump tweeted his support for it – just hours after dismissing the legislation. Perhaps Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) was prescient about the possible problems facing the Senate with this bill. McConnell bolted from the Capitol mid-afternoon Thursday as Pelosi and Mnuchin continued to talk. There was no clear route to pass any coronavirus bill on Thursday afternoon. There was no final bill. And, it took the House an additional 34 hours to assemble the coronavirus package. But Pelosi and Mnuchin wouldn’t have continued to bargain into the night on Thursday and all day Friday had there not been a deal to be had. So, when the Senate finally adjourned Thursday, it locked in a procedural vote at 5:30 p.m. et Monday – related to FISA. That’s the controversial surveillance program which expired over the weekend. Yep. Nothing pertaining to (at that point) any possible coronavirus bill. In fact, the Monday vote tied to FISA in the Senate is two parliamentary steps removed from actually reauthorizing FISA. In Senate language, this is a motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the FISA bill. In layman’s terms, that means the Senate must break a filibuster (with 60 yeas) just to start debate on FISA. If 60 senators vote yes, and there’s no other agreement, and they do it by the book, then the Senate wouldn’t formally start debate until late Tuesday night on FISA. Another procedural vote would be required later in the week just to wrap up all debate. Only then would the Senate be able to vote on FISA and move to the House coronavirus bill. That’s if they do it by the book. And Fox is told there are plenty of senators who want to alter the House coronavirus bill. Let’s start with the status of the FISA package. Attorney General Bill Barr came to Capitol Hill last Monday night to negotiate a final version with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) and members of the conservative Freedom Caucus. The sides forged a bipartisan pact with Pelosi and other Democrats. The House approved the FISA renewal. And then President Trump tweeted that “Many Republican Senators want me to Veto the FISA bill until we find out what led to, and happened with, the illegal attempted ‘coup’ of the duly elected President of the United States and others!” But McCarthy signaled Friday night he expected Mr. Trump to sign FISA once it got through the Senate. In other words, if the Senate can wrap up FISA quickly, only then can the senators advance to the coronavirus bill. But if FISA is stalled, who knows. A top aide to McConnell e-mailed the Capitol Hill press corps after the House finished voting in the wee hours of Saturday morning. The staffer observed it would take the cooperation of 100 senators to start work on the coronavirus bill – regardless of FISA. But, since the House must still resolve problems with its own bill, McConnell suggested Sunday night that it would wait for the House to re-approve that measure.  A senior House Democratic aide expected the House to pass the fixed version of the bill via unanimous consent this week – that’s so long as no one objects. An objection from any lawmaker would stall the bill in the House and require all House members to return to Washington to vote.  You might recall an episode last spring where the House tried to move a $19.1 billion disaster measure to help areas ravaged by hurricanes and flooding. The House hoped to okay the plan via unanimous consent since communities needed the funding. Yet on three different occasions, Reps. Chip Roy (R-TX), Thomas Massie (R-KY) and John Rose (R-TN) all objected. That delayed the bill – forcing the House to vote on the package about a week later. So…. One may ask who would want to get in the way of getting the actual coronavirus bill over to the Senate. Well, there is precedent for lawmakers blocking swift approval of the disaster bill. Many of the 40 House Republicans who opposed the measure Saturday morning complained they only had a few minutes to read the coronavirus bill text. And, to this point, no one truly knows the cost of the measure. It’s anywhere from tens of billions of dollars to the hundreds of billions of dollars.  “We don’t know the price tag because we don’t know the coronavirus model yet,” said one source.  The world has never witnessed a modern pandemic like coronavirus. So any attempt to assign a dollar figure at this stage is potentially a fool’s errand. Keep in mind that this coronavirus bill was supposed to be the easy bill. One can anticipate just how complicated and onerous other bills could be. Industry bailouts. Increases in wages. Back pay. Amplified social programs. A recalibration of health care. Oh, and don’t forget the looming issues with re-insurance. Say what? Here we have a major event which upends the economy and forces the cancellation of practically everything. As we saw after 9/11, it may be tough for some current insurers to remain solvent because of major payouts. Therefore, insurance firms cede the risk to another insurer. That helps mitigate some of the risk. Complicated? You bet.  It’s truly unclear what path the Senate may take with the coronavirus measure this week. Or, maybe it bleeds into next week.  And that’s the issue. Some will argue Congress needs to act – and fast. Others will protest that the bill(s) are too big. Too massive. Congress should slow down. “This all needs to be sorted out at the usual Tuesday lunches,” said one source, referring to the typical policy lunches on Capitol Hill. Each Tuesday, all of the Republicans huddle in the Mike Mansfield Room at the Capitol for lunch. The Democrats crowd into the Lyndon B. Johnson Room.  Yes. Business as usual, apparently. Senators bunching up together in the same room – over lunch, no less.  “We really just need to get these guys out of the building, before everyone gets sick,” said one aide.

"                          Reaction from liberal analyst Cathy Areu and Republican strategist Ash Wright. When the leadership of the Democratic Party and CNN and Uninavision chose March 15 as the date for their eleventh and hopefully last debate, they certainly could not envision the political environment or the crisis that the nation and the world faced. Unfortunately for the country, other than a general attack on PresidentTrump and the usual “Go look at my web page to find my solutions,” this could have been any of the earlier debates with all the other candidates thrown in. The earlier ones were much more entertaining than Sunday night's snoozer. Former Vice President Joe.Biden did better than usual. He probably did enough to continue on his path to the nomination. He didn’t stumble, which we all wait for with great anticipation every time he speaks in public. MARY ANNE MARSH: IN BIDEN-SANDERS DEBATE, SOLUTIONS WIN AND REVOLUTION LOSES Biden did his usual, pandering. A program for everybody. A woman vice president, a black woman on the Supreme Court. Nothing wrong with that, but it might be better if he named who they would be and their qualifications. He also laid out many policy issues that Trump and his supporters will hammer him on in a general election campaign. Wide-open borders, for a start. He also continued on his path to take credit for everything President Barack Obama did except choosing him as vice president. Bernie Sanders is an agent of change who certainly is more knowledgeable about his record and probably Biden's too. Young people who want a revolution have their candidate. It came down to a two-person show between the two oldest candidates running for the nomination. They sound like old men living in the past. And I say that as an old white man who liked much in the past. Ironically, the man they hope to face off against is now the nation's oldest president. Of course, all anyone cares about right now is the most complicated crisis ever to face the United States and the world. This is not a world war or even a civil war, both of which we survived, but it is unlike anything any of us have faced in the last half-century. Biden, if elected, will restore the Democrat agenda. Take care of the lobbyists and refill the swamp. You get the Obama agenda “lite” without the Obama charm. Our nation's health and economy are at serious risk. Our nation is frightened and the question of presidential leadership is what Sunday's debate was about and it is what the November election will be about. It's not going to be decided about policy. It's about leadership. Trump is trailing both of these candidates. But the ball is in his court. He has an excellent medical team around him and if he listens to them and gets us through this most difficult challenge, he wins. If he gets distracted, as he often does, it will be a very close race. I am a Republican supporter of Trump and wouldn’t vote for Biden or Sanders under any circumstance. So my opinion is irrelevant. Biden, if elected, will restore the Democrat agenda. Take care of the lobbyists and refill the swamp. You get the Obama agenda “lite” without the Obama charm.

"                          Supreme Court postpones March oral arguments over coronavirus concerns. This is the first health crisis-related delay for such proceedings since the Spanish flu a century ago. The Supreme Court announced Monday that it will postpone oral arguments for its March session due to concerns over the coronavirus outbreak -- marking the first health crisis-related delay for such proceedings since the Spanish flu a century ago. Those arguments include cases scheduled to come before the court on March 23-25 and March 30-April 1. A press release from the high court said the justices will hold their regular conference on Friday and issue their order list on Monday, though the release said ""some Justices may participate remotely by telephone."" CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW       The Supreme Court is putting off the oral arguments scheduled for its March session, but will still be open for business. This is the first time the court has postponed its oral arguments since the 1918 Spanish flu outbreak. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)       WHO ARE THE 9 JUSTICES ON THE SUPREME COURT The Supreme Court building was already closed to the public last week, and it will remain open for business even as the oral arguments -- which see the justices, several of whom are senior citizens, packed in the courtroom with hundreds of lawyers, activists, members of parties and journalists -- are postponed. Filing deadlines will not be extended, according to the Supreme Court's news release. With the peak of coronavirus spread in the United States not yet in sight, it is unclear when the delayed cases will be heard or if more could be postponed down the road. The cases affected by the postponement will include three cases involving access to President Trump's financial documents for the House Ways and Means Committee and the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, which were scheduled for argument on March 31. Also on hold are a case regarding military prosecution of rape, a trademark case, a high-profile copyright case between tech giants Google and Oracle, a lawsuit by three Muslims who were put on the ""No Fly List"" after refusing to inform to the FBI, a case on the composition of Delaware's state courts, a case on international funding to fight HIV, a Fourth Amendment case, a deportation case and a case on religiously-based discrimination. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP According to the court, the last time the Supreme Court postponed oral arguments due to a health crisis was 1918 as the Spanish flu, which sickened U.S. President Woodrow Wilson at the time, afflicted the United States. The court also reduced its oral arguments in 1793 and 1798 due to yellow fever fears.

"                          'This is where America shines,' says Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine and professor at Baylor College of Medicine. How concerned are you about the coronavirus outbreak? The answer may depend on whether you’re a Democrat or Republican, a new national poll suggests. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey released Sunday found that just over half of Americans are worried that a family member may catch the virus that causes COVID-19, and that six in 10 say the worst is yet to come regarding the pandemic. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW But the poll, which was conducted almost entirely before President Trump declared a national emergency on Friday, points to a wide partisan divide on attitudes regarding the outbreak. Sixty-eight percent of Democrats said they were concerned that a family member could contract the virus. But that number dropped to 40 percent among Republicans. Nearly eight in 10 Democrats felt the worst was yet to come in coping with the pandemic. That number dropped in half to 40 percent among Republicans.  Six in 10 Democrats said they’ve stopped or plan to stop going to any large gatherings. That percentage dropped in half for Republicans. And 47 percent of Democrats, but just 23 percent of Republicans, said they were canceling or rescheduling travel plans. Spotlighting the gravity of the situation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Sunday recommended against holding gatherings of 50 people or more for the next eight weeks. The president, at a Sunday news conference, told Americans to “relax” and said “we’re doing great, it will all pass” as he urged shoppers not to hoard supplies and food at stories. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE CORONVIRUS OUTBREAK According to the poll, 45 percent of Americans gave the president a thumbs up for how he’s handling the coronavirus outbreak. But there’s a gigantic partisan divide. Eighty-one percent of Republicans, but just 13 percent of Democrats, approved of the job he’s doing battling the virus, with independents at 43 percent. The NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll was conducted March 11-13 (Wednesday-Friday), with 900 registered voters nationwide questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s overall sampling error is 3.3 percentage points.

"                          With COVID-19 being declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), it is now more important than ever to prepare yourself for a potential quarantine. Here’s what you should stock up in the midst of this outbreak. Entrepreneur and former presidential candidate Andrew Yang is not being shy about his belief that the impact of the coronavirus outbreak makes the case for his trademark proposal of giving Americans cash so they can have an economic boost. Yang is now calling on lawmakers to do just that to help people navigate their way through the pandemic that has resulted in governments ordering schools and many businesses to close. CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK SPURS NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY, CONNECTICUT TO SHUT BARS, RESTAURANTS AND MOVIE THEATERS ""What exactly is the political downside of putting money into people’s hands? Get your sh-- together Congress and do the right thing,"" Yang tweeted Monday morning. Yang then retweeted a video of Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., on Fox News, where the Republican said legislation from the House did not go far enough. ""We’re going to do everything we can to get cash into the hands of affected workers and families as quickly as possible so we can all get through this pandemic together,"" Cotton said.

Mitt Romney, R-Utah, had a similar but more limited idea, issuing a statement Monday that called for all American adults to receive checks for $1,000 ""to help ensure families and workers can meet their short-term obligations and increase spending in the economy.""

"                          Ellison Barber reports from Columbus, Ohio with a recap of what the Democrat candidates said about coronavirus. After Sunday night’s debate, expect Joe Biden to be all for social distancing as a candidate. He will be perfectly fine staying at home and keeping to himself. It’s the best prevention from voters catching that the Joe Biden we thought we knew is gone. The question is, how long can he get away with it? Traditionally, there are two mistakes that doom candidates. From all appearances, the guy who wants to be known as “Uncle Joe” is going two for two. Mistake One: You cannot play to negative stereotype. If you are the oldest white guy that voters have to choose from in November, it is probably not a good thing to have “Creepy Joe” be one of your search engine results. MARY ANNE MARSH: IN BIDEN-SANDERS DEBATE, SOLUTIONS WIN AND REVOLUTION LOSES Biden’s history of what is widely viewed as improper behavior toward women is well documented. Remember when Biden took the hand of a 24-year-old activist in New Hampshire, called her “kiddo” and told her to “look at my eyes” as he promised to “end fossil fuel.” Further, his sniffing women’s hair and acting inappropriately is unhelpful to demonstrating he gets the #MeToo world. Day after day, the negative stereotype of Biden being out of touch gets reinforced. Any attempts by advisers to hide him to avoid further exposure of these characteristics will never succeed in keeping reality from the voters. In some ways, Biden apparent clinching of the nomination so quickly could backfire on him. The more Americans witness him first-hand, the more the evidence will mount that he is coming pretty close to defining the negative stereotype he needs to avoid. Mistake Two: Do nothing to undermine the positive aspects of yourself that you're “selling.” In business, this is called avoiding compromising the brand. The former vice president’s candidacy has been centered on him being Uncle Joe — reasonable, positive, steady and friendly. In terms of policy and persona, Biden is failing miserably in living up to that brand. Biden was supposedly the “centrist-moderate” candidate. Yet, during the campaign, he has fallen over himself to prove to the most “progressive” members of the party that they can depend on him. Biden was supposedly the “centrist-moderate” among the Democratic presidential contenders. Yet, during the campaign, he has fallen over himself to prove to the most “progressive” members of the party that they can depend on him. Can centrist-moderate Americans really feel good about Biden wanting to automatically enroll them in a government-run “public option” and push out private insurance plans? This would put Washington, D.C., more in charge of health care, with costs going up and access going down. As for reasonable, how comfortable can centrist-moderate Americans be with Biden’s embrace of the Green New Deal? It puts him shoulder to shoulder with Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Let’s face it, their alleged concern for the environment is mere cover for what the impact of the Green New Deal will truly be for Americans. It would cause the largest shift of decision-making away from Americans and to government overlords in our country’s history. Quality of life for all would decline with the amount of taxes needed to pay for their alleged environmental protections. One example: economists say gas taxes would need to rise by $10 to $15 per gallon as a result of the deal. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER When it comes to Biden being steady and ready to sit in the Oval Office, his silly statements, stumbling on key facts and forgetting what he is saying in mid-sentence sends the exact opposite message. For example, at a speech in Houston, Texas, Biden seemingly forgot the words to the Declaration of Independence.  He said: “We hold these truths to be self-evident. All men and women created … by the — you know — you know the thing.” As to being positive and upbeat, Biden now regularly berates potential voters with profanity if they disagree with him. Whether telling a retired Iowa farmer that “You’re a damn liar, man” or yelling “Don’t be such a horse’s ass” and “You’re full of s---” to a Detroit union worker, Biden is showing himself to be intolerant and unfriendly. He leaves little doubt that he would rather shout down those with whom he disagrees rather than have a respectful, open conversation. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Maybe Biden and his advisers believe all of this helps show he is up to the task of “taking Trump head-on.”  Maybe, but it is compromising the basic brand. All in all, it is indeed remarkable that Joe Biden is on the verge of completely clinching the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination.  Still, one has to ask, how long can Biden get away with what he is doing?

"                          Coronavirus task force urge drastic measures to slow spread; reaction and analysis from the 'Special Report' All-Stars. President Trump announced on Monday a set of guidelines that he said Americans should follow to prevent the further spread of the coronavirus -- despite admitting that the pandemic could stretch into July or August. Speaking during a briefing of the coronavirus task force, Trump outlined a plan to slow the spread of COVID-19 in 15 days. “With several weeks of focused action, we can turn the corner and turn it quickly,” Trump said. “Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes.” CLICK FOR THE CORONAVIRUS GUIDELINES RELEASED BY THE WHITE HOUSE At another point during the news conference, asked if the U.S. was headed into a recession, Trump replied: “Well, it may be.” But then, he said, “We're not thinking in terms of recession, we're thinking in terms of the virus.” The guidelines advised that older people and those with underlying health conditions “stay home and away from other people.” Officials recommended that large swaths of the population isolate themselves and everyone avoid social gatherings or groups of more than 10 people. They also said Americans should work from home if possible; avoid eating or drinking in bars and restaurants; and “avoid discretionary travel, shopping trips, and social visits.” When asked when the pandemic would subside, Trump said that “if we do a really good job,” the crisis could pass by July or August, a far less optimistic take than in his earlier predictions that it could be over within weeks. “We will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus,” he added. Trump's comments came as Ohio's governor announced his recommendation to delay the state's primary election until June amid the outbreak. The president said that while the state's whose presidential primary elections are being very careful, he thinks postponing elections are ""unnecessary."" ""Postponing is not a very good thing,"" he said. ""I think postponing is unnecessary.” The coronavirus pandemic has infected over 169,000 people and killed over 6,500. The COVID-19 illness has caused mild or moderate symptoms for most patients, but severe symptoms have been more likely in the elderly or people with existing health problems. More than 77,000 people have recovered from it so far, mostly in China. The U.S. surgeon general said Monday that the United States was about where Italy was two weeks ago in the coronavirus struggle, a sign that infections were expected to rise. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW “We are at a critical inflection point in this country, people,” Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams told Fox News. “When you look at the projections, there's every chance that we could be Italy.” Still, he said the U.S. had opportunities to mitigate the pandemic. On Fox News, Adams claimed the U.S. had “turned the tide” on testing, a critical part of tracking and containing pandemics, but whether that was true remained to be seen. The U.S. effort has been hobbled by a series of missteps, including flaws with the testing kits first distributed by the federal government and bureaucratic hurdles that held up testing by private laboratories. But, Trump, who has been sharply criticized for underplaying the severity of the crisis, stuck to his optimistic tone about the nation's response. “Everybody is so well unified and working so hard,” he tweeted. “It is a beautiful thing to see.” The Associated Press contributed to this report.

"                          Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Gov. Mike DeWine on Monday night announced his state's health director will order Ohio's polls to be closed Tuesday ""as a health emergency"" over the spread of the coronavirus, a dramatic move just hours before the state's scheduled primaries. DeWine had recommended that the primaries be postponed, but a county judge had denied the request Monday evening. ""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus. As such, Health Director Dr. Amy Acton will order the polls closed as a health emergency. While the polls will be closed tomorrow, Secretary of State Frank LaRose will seek a remedy through the courts to extend voting options so that every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity,"" DeWine said in a statement. “The only thing more important than a free and fair election is the health and safety of Ohioans. The Ohio Department of Health and the CDC have advised against anyone gathering in groups larger than 50 people, which will occur if the election goes forward. Additionally, Ohioans over 65 and those with certain health conditions have been advised to limit their nonessential contact with others, affecting their ability to vote or serve as poll workers,” DeWine and LaRose said earlier, after the judge's ruling. “Logistically, under these extraordinary circumstances, it simply isn’t possible to hold an election tomorrow that will be considered legitimate by Ohioans. They mustn’t be forced to choose between their health and exercising their constitutional rights.” MARCH 17 PRIMARIES: HERE ARE THE STATES VOTING AND THE DELEGATES AT STAKE President Trump -- speaking at a coronavirus briefing at the White House Monday afternoon -- said he'd leave such decisions on postponing a primary up to the states but emphasized, ""I think postponing is unnecessary."" Ohio is the only one of the four states scheduled to hold presidential primaries on Tuesday to move to postpone its contest. Officials in the other states - Arizona, Florida and Illinois - said their primaries would still take place. The governor's office had filed the lawsuit in Franklin County with the hopes that it would quickly receive court approval. The governor’s move came a day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Sunday recommended against holding gatherings of 50 people or more for the next eight weeks. STATES THAT HAVE POSTPONED PRIMARIES DUE TO CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK The governor also said: ""It is clear that tomorrow’s in-person voting does not conform with the CDC guidelines. We cannot conduct this election tomorrow, the in-person voting for 13 hours tomorrow – and conform to these guidelines.” The governor also emphasized that “ultimately it is not fair to make people pick between their health and constitutional rights. Voters can vote by mail, and this will help us achieve the goal that people maintain their constitutional rights safely.” DeWine also recommended that “between now and then absentee ballot voting be permitted.” A LOOK AT FLORIDA’S PRIMARY WINNERS IN PAST PRESIDENTIAL CONTESTS Soon after the move by DeWine to postpone primary day in Ohio, officials in Florida and Illinois announced that their primaries were still on for Tuesday. “I wanted to let you know that Illinois is proceeding with plans for tomorrow’s primary as scheduled,” Illinois State Board of Elections public information officer Matt Dietrich wrote in an email to reporters. Dietrich highlighted that as of Monday, 504,000 early votes had already been cast and that 294,000 mail ballots had been sent to voters. Both figures were significantly higher than in the 2016 primary. “With early voting continuing today, we likely will see a substantial increase when early voting sites close. We along with the state’s 108 local election authorities had been encouraging early voting for several weeks and in the past two weeks had increased our efforts so voters could vote early and avoid lines and crowds on election day out of concern for coronavirus,” he emphasized. In justifying the decision to go forward with the primary, Dietrich noted that “much of the voting for this election already has been done. Also, at this point there is no date in the foreseeable future when we can expect greater safety with any certainty.” And pointing to Illinois Gov. Jay Pritzker’s order to close restaurants and bars except for carryout service, he said “we want to point out that in-person voting is a comparable transaction to picking up a takeout restaurant order or shopping at a grocery store. There is no need for close contact when requesting a ballot from an election judge and Illinois does not require voters to show ID; a voter’s signature compared to the signature on record is proof of identity. Primary voting typically is a swift transaction that can be done at a safe distance from other voters.” Florida’s Department of State told Fox News “we are moving forward” with their primary. Earlier Monday, Secretary of State Laurel M Lee tweeted “we are aware of voters’ concerns over #COVID19. FL Dept of Health has assured healthy Floridians it’s safe to work the polls for & vote in Tuesday’s election. Supervisors of Elections are ensuring polls are prepared for voters.” Arizona Gov. Steve Ducey announced a couple of hours later that their primary would also be held on Tuesday. ""We’ve made sure that election officials have the equipment and the support they need for the polling places to function tomorrow. Our elected leaders have been working overtime to ensure that voting is safe,"" the governor said. Secretary of State Katie Hobbs explained ""this decision was not made lightly and what it all comes down to is that we have no guarantee that there will be a safer time to hold this election in the near future."" ""There are thousands of workers across the state that must continue the job of counting the ballots in the days following the election. The longer we wait, the more difficult and dangerous this becomes,"" she emphasized. Earlier in the day, she tweeted instructions and suggestions for voters to stay safe avoid contracting the coronavirus while casting their ballot. Over a couple of days, Georgia, Louisana and Puerto Rico -- which have upcoming contests -- have delayed their primaries until later in the spring. Biden's election eve lead Joe Biden holds a commanding lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders in Arizona, according to two new polls released on the eve of that state’s presidential primary. A Monmouth University survey released on Monday shows the former vice president with 51 percent support among likely Democratic presidential primary voters. Sanders – the populist lawmaker from Vermont who’s making his second straight White House run – stands at 31 percent.  That's 20 percentage points behind Biden. And Biden leads Sanders by 17 points – 53-36 percent – in an NBC News/Marist poll that also released on Monday. Sixty-seven pledged delegates are up for grabs in Arizona. Biden tops Sanders 58-35 percent in an NBC News/Marist poll in Ohio, where 136 pledged delegates are at stake if the contest is held. The most recent polls in Florida and Illinois also indicated Biden enjoying large double-digit leads over Sanders. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal national survey released on Sunday showed Biden with a nearly two-to-one advantage over Sanders in the race for the Democratic nomination. In the last two and a half weeks, Sanders has watched Biden zoom past him in the race for the presidential nomination. Following a landslide win in South Carolina’s primary and sweeping victories in the coast-to-coast Super Tuesday states as well as last week’s mini Super Tuesday, the former vice president cemented his position as the unrivaled front-runner and has taken a commanding lead in the all-important race for convention delegates.

"                          Will Joe Biden fail in a general election without Sen. Bernie Sanders' diehard supporters? It's clear – Joe Biden has his work cut out for him as he tries to unite the Democratic Party. The day after delivering a more aggressive than expected debate performance against the former vice president and current presidential primary front-runner, Sen. Bernie Sanders vowed that “this primary is far from over.” In an email to supporters, the progressive firebrand from Vermont took aim at his rival as he spotlighted that Biden “has argued that we have to cut Social Security, voted for the war in Iraq, supported the Hyde Amendment that restricts poor women’s access to abortion, has threatened to veto legislation that will guarantee health care as a right, led the fight for the disastrous bankruptcy bill.”  BIDEN UP 20 POINTS OVER SANDERS IN ARIZONA ON EVE OF PRIMARY: POLL Sanders also targeted Biden on Twitter, writing “you need to take on Wall Street, the drug companies, the insurance companies, and the fossil fuel industry. You don’t take campaign contributions from them.” The night before, during the debate, the self-declared democratic socialist repeatedly jabbed at Biden over his long record in Washington, his fundraising from corporations and his support from outside super PACs. Sanders also turned down a symbolic policy olive branch from Biden, who in the lead-up to the debate embraced progressive policies pushed by Sanders on free college tuition and bankruptcy reform. A frustrated Biden said during the prime-time showdown that Sanders is “making it hard for me” to bridge the gap between them. The deep policy divisions on display during and following the debate are, in turn, renewing fears that Democrats could experience a repeat of 2016 – when many Sanders supporters wouldn't vote for eventual nominee Hillary Clinton after a long and divisive primary battle. Democrats, desperate to defeat President Donald Trump in November’s general election, are trying to prevent heading into the general election with the progressive base of the party once again fractured. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN Since Biden’s sweeping victories in last Tuesday’s primaries, when he took a large lead over Sanders in the crucial race for convention delegates and cemented his front-runner status, #NeverBiden has started to trend on Twitter. And Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York – a top Sanders surrogate and progressive rock star – took to Twitter Sunday night to repeatedly bash Biden over what she seemed to frame as policy flip-flops. The tweet indicated lingering resistance on the left to embracing Biden's appeals to progressives. “Don’t say you support a fracking ban when you don’t. Don’t say you didn’t write the bankruptcy bill when you were one of it’s biggest champions. Don’t say you supported ending Hyde a long time ago when you were just pressured into it last year,” the congresswoman tweeted. “This is basic. The truth matters.” As he tries to keep the peace, a comment immediately after the debate from a Biden senior adviser may not have helped. “It’s safe to say Vice President Biden showed up to a debate tonight and for two hours graciously [dealt] with a kind of protester who often shows up at campaign events, on live television,” Anita Dunn told reporters on a conference call. Others on the call worried about a drawn-out and contentious primary harming the party's general election goals. The latest clashes have a leading Sanders supporter in New Hampshire worried. “Yes. It will be work and I intend to work as hard as I can to unite the ticket, as I did in 2016,” former state Sen. Burt Cohen told Fox News. “It’s not going to be easy. I hope it’s not as hard as it was in 2016.” And Cohen is not sure Biden’s up to the task of bringing the Sanders wing of the party into the fold. “I worry about Joe Biden frankly,” Cohen said. “When I see him, he doesn’t have any charisma. He doesn’t get people excited.” Adam Green, co-founder of the pro-Warren Progressive Change Campaign Committee, last week urged Sanders to stay in the race to debate Biden.  “He was more aggressive than I thought he was going to be but he was less effective at securing concrete commitments on progressive issues from Biden than I thought he would be given how aggressive he was,” noted Green, who along with the PCCC were major supporters of progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s White House bid. Asked if he’s concerned about a repeat of the 2016 Democratic divisions, Green told Fox News “not yet.” “Especially in this new coronavirus crisis world, Democrats need to see how our nominee will campaign and sturdy they are and last night’s debate – even if it was a bit messy – was productive for both candidates to seem more presidential and more correct on policy than Trump. More of that so we have a tested candidate is good.” Democratic strategist Chris Moyer disagreed with those predicting another chasm. “It does not seem like Senator Sanders is taking the same approach as he did four years ago,” argued Moyer, a veteran of the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign as well as Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey’s 2020 White House bid. “While many thought he might handle the debate differently, right now there are not broad concerns about a long, drawn-out primary that hurts our eventual nominee, which is quite clearly going to be Vice President Biden.”    ",         Democrats face 2016 déjà vu as left resists peace with primary front-runner,         2020-03-16T141337-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/democrats-face-2016-deja-vu-as-left-resists-peace-with-primary-front-runner,Fox
"                          Insight from Fox News contributor Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, emergency medicine physician. The California Legislature approved up to $1 billion in new spending on Monday to combat the coronavirus outbreak, then suspended their work for the next month to try and contain the illness. It is believed to be the first unexpected work stoppage in the California Legislature in 158 years, according to Alex Vassar, an unofficial legislative historian at the California State Library. And it came on the heels of extraordinary bipartisanship, as Republicans and Democrats alike voted overwhelmingly to give Gov. Gavin Newsom broad authority to spend during the crisis without their oversight. “It is a request to step away from our desks much earlier than we would like. The demands of public health require it,” Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon said. The California Legislature has rarely closed. The Legislature did not miss meetings during either of the world wars or in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. In 2001, when a semi-truck crashed into the Senate side of the Capitol, the Senate convened right on schedule about 12 hours later in the Assembly chambers. And last year, when a woman threw her own blood onto the floor of the state Senate in an act of protest on the session’s final day, lawmakers reconvened hours later in a committee room to finish their work. The only time lawmakers did unexpectedly suspend their meetings was in 1862, when a flood consumed most of Sacramento and, legend has it, forced newly elected Gov. Leland Stanford to use a boat to attend his inauguration. Lawamkers missed a few days before reconvening in San Francisco to continue their work, according Vassar. In 1919, during a flu pandemic, at least five lawmakers had symptoms and had to be quarantined. Leaders discussed whether lawmakers should stop meeting, but eventually decided to “disinfect the Capitol daily and to keep meeting,” Vassar said. “It is an extremely rare occurrence for the Legislature to stop meeting during the regular session,” Vassar said. Lawmakers agreed Monday to stay away until April 13. But legislative leaders in either chamber can decide to reconvene. And they can extend the recess if necessary. “We will be prepared on a moment’s notice to return ton address any urgent action that we must take,” Senate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins said. The legislation approved Monday gives Gov. Gavin Newsom $500 million to spend “for any item for any purpose” related to his March 4 declaration of emergency. In the future, Newsom could increase that spending by increments of $50 million — but only if he tells lawmakers about it three days in advance. The spending is capped at $1 billion. “By taking this action we are placing an extraordinary degree of trust in Gov. Gavin Newsom. However, these are extraordinary times,” said Republican Assemblyman Jay Obernolte. A separate bill would make sure public schools that closed because of the outbreak don’t lose funding. It would also allocate $100 million to schools for “personal protective equipment” or to pay for “supplies and labor related to cleaning.” State law bans lawmakers from voting on bills unless they have been available for public review for at least three days. But lawmakers can waive that law if the governor asks them to. Newsom did that on Monday. “Today I write to you to state the obvious: we must rise to the challenge facing our state with every tool at our disposal and without a second of delay,” Newsom wrote in a letter to the Legislature. “We cannot hesitate to meet this moment.” Lawmakers overwhelmingly voted to approve his request. Lawmakers were in action on Monday while most other entities in California were closed. Sunday, Newsom urged everyone 65 and older to stay home. Presumably, that order included the 25 lawmakers in the state Legislature who are older than 65. Assemblyman Jose Medina, 66, said he was already on a plane headed to Sacramento on Sunday when Newsom asked people 65 and older to stay home. He attended Monday’s Assembly session, saying he thought his constituents would “appreciate that we are still doing the work of the state of California.” “It’s nothing that I would take lightly, and I think that most folks my age and older are taking it seriously,” said Medina, a Democrat who represents Riverside. But 73-year-old Assemblyman Bill Quirk stayed home. He lives in a retirement community in the San Francisco Bay Area with his wife. While the two of them are healthy, many of their neighbors are not. GET THE FOX NEWS APP “If I were to bring home the coronavirus, 20 people could die, or maybe even 40,” Quirk said. “Some people think they are really important and they should always be working. And I can tell you I’m not so important that we can even risk one life here, period.”    ",         California legislature suspends meeting for first time in 158 years,         2020-03-17T010920-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/california-legislature-suspends-meeting-for-first-time-in-158-years,Fox
"                          The Trump campaign files a libel lawsuit against New York Times for the paper's March 27, 2019 op-ed titled ‘The Real Trump-Russia Quid Pro Quo;’ reaction and analysis from ‘Media Buzz’ host Howard Kurtz. In a striking and unexpected abandonment of a once-heralded prosecution initiated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, the Justice Department moved Monday to drop charges against two Russian companies that were accused of funding a social media meme campaign to further their “strategic goal to sow discord in the U.S. political system, including the 2016 presidential election.” Late Monday, with jury selection in the case set to begin in just two weeks, a federal judge granted the DOJ's motion to kill the prosecution. The government acknowledged the Russian companies were never likely to actually face punishment anyway and cited possible national security risks with going forward to trial. Concord Management and Consulting LLC and Concord Catering were among three companies and 13 individuals charged in February 2018 by Mueller. Their alleged criminal effort included social media postings and campaigns aimed at dividing American public opinion and sowing discord in the electorate, officials said, although no actual impact on voters was ever proven. Of the 13 Russians and three Russian companies charged by Mueller in the social media disinformation effort, Concord was the sole defendant to enter an appearance in Washington’s federal court and contest and the allegations. Mueller's 37-page indictment said the actions detailed by prosecutors dated back to 2014. (Mueller later brought separate charges against other entities related to a hack of Democrats' emails in the summer of 2018.) READ THE DOJ'S MOTION TO DROP CHARGES President Trump noted that no Russian collusion with his campaign was ever proven, and Republicans and even left-of-center commenators argued that Russian disinformation was mostly irrelevant, given that social media and other platforms are already rife with inaccuracies. ""Before a pandemic, there was a time when we were relentlessly told to fear Russian social media accounts,"" mused journalist Aaron Mate on Monday. ""Their juvenile memes not only elected Trump, but also 'sowed chaos.' When Mueller indicted 13 Russians over it, he was hailed as a hero. Well, DOJ just dropped the case."" Various media outlets had hyped the indictment, with NPR calling the Russians' activities an ""attack"" on democracy.  ""For me, personally, hearing these charges and hearing what they were charging these Russians for -- it was the first time that I felt like finally, finally, for the first time since we realized all this was happened, finally, it feels like someone is defending us,"" MSNBC host Rachel Maddow said at the time, seemingly holding back tears. Concord is controlled by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a wealthy businessman known as “Putin’s chef” for his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. He has been hit with U.S. sanctions over Russian interference in the 2016 election and is charged alongside his company in the indictment brought by Mueller.

The Justice Department is moving to drop charges against some Russian companies that were accused of funding a social media campaign to sway American public opinion during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. (Sergei Ilnitsky/Pool Photo via AP, File)       The company, with the help of a high-powered law firm, filed a series of motions over the last two years, including to dismiss charges and to exclude certain evidence from the case. In January 2019, prosecutors said confidential material from the Russia investigation, which had been handed over to defense attorneys for Concord, was altered and released online as part of a disinformation campaign to discredit the special counsel's Russia investigation. READ MUELLER'S INITIAL INDICTMENT The files surfaced online in a link posted by a pro-Russia Twitter account. But the Justice Department stopped short of accusing Concord of leaking the material. Still, they argued that the company’s request to have sensitive new evidence sent to Russia “unreasonably risks the national security interests of the United States.”       Special Counsel Robert Mueller announced the prosecution of Russian trolls in 2018; that prosecution is now dropped. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File)       Some of the court appearances in the case have been unusually contentious, with the federal judge overseeing it chastising a lawyer for the company, Eric Dubelier, for references in court filings to Looney Tunes and the 1978 raunchy comedy “Animal House” to criticize the Mueller investigation. “I’ll say it plain and simply: Knock it off,” U.S District Judge Dabney Friedrich told Dubelier at a January 2019 court appearance. Dubelier, who has referred to the case as involving a “made up” crime, has made allegations of prosecutorial misconduct and even once accused the judge of bias. JUDGE SLAMS DNC OVER LAWSUIT AGAINST TRUMP CAMP, SAYS NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION ""The real Department of Justice"" never would have brought the case,"" Dubelier said at one 2018 hearing. At one point, he curtly rejected a DOJ summons, saying prosecutors ""are already behaving in a manner that is inconsistent with the practices of the DOJ."" He also accused the DOJ of having ""indicted the proverbial ham sandwich."" And, the Twitter user Techno Fog observed that Dubelier also flatly accused one of Mueller's prosecutors of being a liar. But with the case approaching trial, prosecutors beat a hasty retreat, and said they had to weigh the risk of potentially exposing sensitive national security information against the benefits of continuing with the case against a company that likely wouldn’t face any significant punishment in the United States. In the court filing on Monday, prosecutors said Concord had been “eager and aggressive in using the judicial system to gather information about how the United States detects and prevents foreign election interference.” “In short, Concord has demonstrated its intent to reap the benefits of the Court’s jurisdiction while positioning itself to evade any real obligations or responsibility,” prosecutors wrote in Monday’s filing. “It is no longer in the best interests of justice or the country’s national security to continue this prosecution."" At the same time, Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers and U.S. Attorney for Washington Timothy Shea defended the initial indictment. ""There is a substantial federal interest in defending American democratic institutions, exposing those who endeavor to criminally interfere with them, and holding them accountable, which is why this prosecution was properly commenced in the first place,"" the prosecutors said. They added: ""In light of the defendant’s conduct, however, its ephemeral presence and immunity to just punishment, the risk of exposure of law enforcement’s tools and techniques, and the post-indictment change in the proof available at trial, the balance of equities has shifted."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Concord Catering did not have attorneys appear in court, but prosecutors said they would seek to drop charges against that company as well because it too was controlled by Prigozhin and “based on the likelihood that its approach to litigation would be the same as Concord.” Prosecutors vowed to continue to pursue their case against the 13 Russians who were named in Mueller's indictment, along with the troll farm that Concord was alleged to have funded, the Internet Research Agency.

House lawmakers approved a revamped multibillion-dollar coronavirus relief package Monday that was initially passed over the early morning hours of the weekend after negotiations between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Trump administration. Lawmakers OK'd the measure containing technical corrections via unanimous consent. The Senate is expected to take up the legislation Tuesday. Senators will have to approve both plans to avoid sending the fixed bill back to the House. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, expressed reservations about the legislation and initially threatened to block it over what he said were harmful impacts to small businesses. In the end, he didn't object. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin will meet with Senate Republicans for lunch Tuesday afternoon to discuss the next steps. The bill initially passed 363-40 in the early hours on Saturday. It includes paid emergency leave with two weeks of paid sick leave and up to three months of paid family and medical leave. The legislation came after Republicans raised concerns over its impact on small businesses, increased spending on Medicaid and language not included that prevents federal funds from being used for abortions. In an effort to get skeptical House GOP members on board, President Trump threw his support toward the package after some language was changed. Trump is also calling for a payroll tax holiday to give economic relief to Americans. That provision was not included in the bill. Hours before the first version of the bill passed, Trump declared a national emergency over the pandemic and announced partnerships with several companies to expand coronavirus testing.

"                          New rule would make it easier to deny green cards for immigrants getting government assistance; USCIS acting director Ken Cuccinelli weighs in. Immigrants who get tested or treated for the coronavirus will not be penalized when applying for citizenship under a public charge rule that restricts green cards for those who use taxpayer-funded services. In a statement, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said that it is encouraging anyone with symptoms of the COVID-19 to seek medical treatment. ""Such treatment or preventive services will not negatively affect any alien as part of a future Public Charge analysis,"" the agency said. ""To address the possibility that some aliens impacted by COVID-19 may be hesitant to seek necessary medical treatment or preventive services, USCIS will neither consider testing, treatment, nor preventative care (including vaccines, if a vaccine becomes available) related to COVID-19 as part of a public charge inadmissibility determination,"" the agency continued. CANADA CLOSES BORDER TO NONCITIZENS AMID CORONAVIRUS; AMERICANS EXEMPT, TRUDEAU SAYS The public charge rule went into effect last week after the Supreme Court in January allowed the Trump administration to enforce it. The rule essentially restricts immigrants entering the United States if the government believes they will rely on public assistance such as welfare or health care and housing benefits. Lower federal courts had blocked the rule from being enforced before the high court ruling.

"                          Former Vice President Joe Biden's lead in the race for Democratic presidential nomination is becoming political insurmountable, says Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume. Joe Biden has been declared the winner of the Democratic presidential primary in Washington state, giving him victories in five out of six states that voted March 10. After nearly a week of counting votes, the former vice president on Monday held onto a small lead over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders that turned out to be insurmountable. Washington was a state that Sanders had been hoping to win. In 2016, he won more than two-thirds of the delegates from the Washington caucuses over Hillary Clinton. Of the state's 89 pledged delegates, only 31 are allocated based on the statewide result. The remaining 58 are determined based on the results of the state's 10 congressional districts, and those results might not be calculated until the election is certified by the secretary of state's office, which could be as late as March 27. Biden won four other states last Tuesday: Missouri, Mississippi, Michigan and Idaho. Sanders won North Dakota.

"                          Former acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker joins David Asman on 'CAVUTO Live.' The Senate on Monday approved a 77-day extension of the several major surveillance powers under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) that had expired Sunday night -- a temporary compromise reached as some Republicans and Democrats say they will soon push to amend the law to curb the government's monitoring capabilities. The legislation now goes back to the House to sync up, which affords lawmakers more time to pass a bill to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. President Trump, whose former campaign advisor Carter Page was extensively monitored under FISA based on information that has since been proven legally inadequate and in some cases fraudulent, has floated the possibility of vetoing a FISA reauthorization should it come to his desk. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee, on Monday urged an amendment that would prohibit the warrantless collection of web browsing and Internet search history, as well as an amendment establishing independent oversight of the FISA process. “Under this agreement the Senate will have an opportunity to debate whether the government can conduct digital tracking of Americans without a warrant,"" Wyden said. ""Everyone who was concerned about the government collecting their library records, or seeing who you called, should be terrified that the government can grab your Internet browsing history without a warrant. That’s wrong, and my amendment prohibits that practice. And I strongly support my colleagues’ amendment to add independent oversight of FISA, which has had bipartisan support for many years and will finally be considered.” Prior to Monday's voice vote, Reps. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, and Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., urged the Senate to reject the bill in its current form. “If cloture is invoked tonight, it will be the final success of a campaign to prevent any member of Congress from casting any vote for serious FISA reform,"" the represenatives wrote in a letter Monday. They noted that the bill “has not been marked by or passed out of any committee of jurisdiction. ... In other words, there was not an opportunity to amend or cure defects in this bill."" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., supports the legislation and had hoped to pass it last Thursday, but he was forced to delay consideration past the expiration date after Mike Lee, R-Utah, and two other senators — Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Wyden — said they would object. The House legislation, negotiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, would renew several provisions the FBI sees as vital to fighting terrorism but also aim to ensure stricter oversight of how the bureau conducts surveillance. PAUL: MY FISA AMENDMENT WILL KEEP AMERICA SAFE Lee had proposed a deal on the Senate floor Thursday — extension of the current authorities if the Senate would consider several amendments to the House bill that would further limit them. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, speaking on the floor for McConnell, objected to that deal, saying the Senate should instead pass the House bill.       Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has pushed for FISA reforms. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)       “We’re not a rubberstamp for the House of Representatives,"" Lee said. ""We’re certainly not a rubber stamp for the Deep State."" On Monday, McConnell killed a procedural vote on the House FISA bill and teed up debate on a package of amendments from Lee and Paul, among others. ""We shouldn’t have to wait until the moment when we’re on the eve of the expiration of some important legislation and where we have to wait for the president of the United States to weigh in and lean in,” Lee said. “From time to time, laws require revision and review and reform. That always necessarily requires amendments.” Added Paul: ""They can do it the easy way or the hard way. The easy way is that they allow debate."" FISA COURT ORDERS REFORMS -- BUT LEAVES OUT KEY MYSTERY PLAYER The House legislation updates the three expiring surveillance provisions, including one that permits the FBI to obtain court orders to collect business records on subjects in national security investigations. Another, known as the “roving wiretap” provision, permits surveillance on subjects even after they’ve changed phones. The third allows agents to monitor subjects who don’t have ties to international terrorism organizations. ""We’re certainly not a rubber stamp for the Deep State."" The House legislation, passed Wednesday, is a compromise that reflects angst in both parties about the way the surveillance powers have been used, but also a reluctance to strip those powers from the government's arsenal. Republicans and Democrats in the House broadly agreed that they did not want civil liberties sacrificed in efforts to thwart terrorism and other crimes. In addition, Republicans had been aggressively seeking changes to the law since the Justice Department's investigation into Trump's campaign and Russia, while many Democrats already had concerns about government surveillance. FISC SLAMS FBI, SAYS 'FREQUENCY' OF ERRORS AND INACCURACIES CALLS INTO QUESTION PREVIOUS FISA WARRANT APPLICATIONS At the behest of those Republicans, the House compromise takes aim at some of the missteps the Justice Department has acknowledged making during the Russia investigation. Applications under FISA to eavesdrop on a former Trump campaign aide were riddled with omissions and missteps, according to a scathing inspector general report. The measure would require that officers responsible for FISA applications certify that the department has been advised of any information that could undercut or contradict the premise of the surveillance.       Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, successfully secured a deal for debate on FISA amendments.      (AP) In the Russia investigation, some of the information the FBI omitted from its applications cut against the idea that former Trump adviser Carter Page was a Russian agent, the watchdog found. In one case, an FBI lawyer falsified an email from the CIA that was later submitted to the FISA court, making Page's contacts with Russians seem unreported and nefarious. Page has denied that and was never charged with wrongdoing. The bill also would institute criminal penalties and other sanctions for making false statements to the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which issues warrants to the FBI to eavesdrop on people it has probable cause to believe are agents of a foreign power. It would require the attorney general to approve in writing of an investigation if the target of the surveillance is a federal candidate or official. FORMER FBI LAWYER LISA PAGE SUES FBI AND DOJ, SAYS SHE NEEDS 'COST OF THERAPY' REIMBURSED AFTER TRUMP MOCKED HER BIAS Attorney General William Barr was involved in the negotiations with the White House and Congress, and he said Wednesday that he supports the bill. “It is of the utmost important that the Department’s attorneys and investigators always work in a manner consistent with the highest professional standards, and this overall package will help ensure the integrity of the FISA process and protect against future abuses going forward,"" Barr said. But Barr's support does not guarantee that Trump is on board. The president kept Congress guessing with a Thursday tweet that did not indicate how he would act. “Many Republican Senators want me to Veto the FISA Bill until we find out what led to, and happened with, the illegal attempted “coup” of the duly elected President of the United States, and others!,” Trump tweeted, referring to the FBI's Russia investigation.

"                          The Trump Administration's response to coronavirus has been criticized by both Democratic Presidential candidates. Here is how former VP Joe Biden would fight the disease officially known as COVID-19. ""No more, no new fracking."" Those five words spoken by former Vice President Joe Biden during Sunday night's Democratic presidential debate brought on renewed attacks against him from the left -- namely Bernie Sanders endorser Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. -- as well as from the right. And the pushback on the primary front-runner's fracking statement was particularly stiff in his natural gas–reliant home state of Pennsylvania. ""The calls for a moratorium on fracking by presidential candidates are misguided and show no understanding of where energy and important consumer and medical products come from, and how important they are to our lives,"" Pennsylvania Independent Oil & Gas Association President Daniel J. Weaver said in a statement to Fox News.       This Jan. 17, 2013 file photo shows a fracking site in New Milford, Pa.      (AP) SANDERS ATTACKS BIDEN AS ONE-ON-ONE DEBATE TURNS PERSONAL: 'DON'T LAUGH, JOE' From the left, Ocasio-Cortez criticized Biden on Twitter overnight for not calling for an outright ban on fracking, but seemingly trying to make it sound like he is. ""Don't say you support a fracking ban when you don't,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""This is basic. The truth matters."" The fracking issue is just a snapshot of the political balancing act facing Biden as he tries to unite the Democratic Party -- including ardent Sanders supporters -- while also appealing to moderates and winning in Rust Belt states like Pennsylvania that went for Trump in 2016. While Biden does not call for an outright ban on fracking like Sanders does, he does advocate, on his campaign website, ""banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters."" Fox News reached out to the Biden campaign for comment and to clarify that his Sunday statement did not signify a policy shift but did not immediately receive a response. The Washington Examiner, however, reported that the campaign asserted that Biden was simply stating what has been his policy all along. ED ROLLINS: DEMOCRATIC DEBATE A SNOOZER FULL OF PANDERING AT A TIME WHEN NATION NEEDS THIS While the RealClearPolitics average of polls shows Biden beating Trump head-to-head in Pennsylvania in the general election, any restrictions on fracking are unlikely to be popular in states like Pennsylvania, which Biden, if he secures the Democratic presidential nomination, would consider critical in November. ""There is nothing ‘moderate’ about Vice President Biden’s plan to curb and eventually eliminate fracking. It’s just a ban by another name,"" Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said in a statement to Fox News on Monday. BIDEN UP 20 POINTS OVER SANDERS IN ARIZONA ON EVE OF PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY: POLL He added: ""The end result of the plans offered by Vice President Biden and Senator Sanders is the same: devastation for Pennsylvania’s economy, tens of thousands of workers losing their jobs, higher home heating costs for Pennsylvania families, higher CO2 emissions, and our trading partners switching to coal for electricity production or depending on hostile authoritarian regimes, like Russia’s, for natural gas."" Rep. Fred Keller, R-Pa., also addressed Biden's moratorium on fracking and Sanders' proposal for an outright ban on fracking. ""Vice President Biden and Senator Sanders’ continued absurd and dangerous attack on fracking shows they are not only out of touch with reality, but out of touch with hardworking Americans who have benefited from our robust energy economy,"" Keller said Monday. ""Proposals like this would eliminate hundreds of thousands of good-paying blue collar jobs and guarantee that Donald Trump wins states like Pennsylvania and ultimately the presidency."" BIDEN'S CONCESSIONS: HOW EX-VP HAS SHIFTED COURSE IN BID TO WOO LEFT Biden, for his part, has touted his climate record as a member of the Obama administration in pleas for Democrats to back a candidate with a proven record of getting environmental reforms done as he makes his pitch to be the sensible, effective choice in the primary. ""$90 billion in clean energy funding. A huge reduction in the cost of solar so that we'll never build another coal plant again,"" Biden tweeted Sunday night. ""I did that. Bernie watched."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Several large states including Florida are expected to vote Tuesday as Biden looks to grow his lead in the primary race, which has only become larger since his romp on Super Tuesday that saw him take wins in 10 different states. Pennsylvania, along with five other states in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast, are scheduled to vote in the Democratic primary on April 28, but it is unclear whether they will be forced to move back their elections because of the coronavirus pandemic.

"                          Ellison Barber reports from Columbus, Ohio with a recap of what the Democrat candidates said about coronavirus. No candidates in sight – no campaigning – and no canvassing. Welcome to the first presidential primary during a pandemic in modern times. Voters in three states will briefly head to the polls with trepidation on Tuesday - with the country facing an unprecedented crisis as the coronavirus has forced most Americans to self-isolate in their homes in hopes of stemming the spread of the outbreak. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW On primary eve – Ohio’s governor used an emergency order to postpone his state’s contest after the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) urged against any gatherings nationwide of 50 people or more. “We cannot conduct this election tomorrow,” Gov. Mike DeWine stressed. While the polls will be closed in Ohio, contests in Arizona, Florida, and Illinois – will go forward on Tuesday.  And that could give Democratic presidential nomination front-runner Joe Biden a chance to deliver a potential knockout blow to Sen. Bernie Sanders – who’s fighting to avoid elimination from the White House race. “This primary is far from over,” Sanders stressed in an email to supporters on the eve of the March 17 contests. But in reality – the progressive senator from Vermont who’s making his second straight bid for the Democratic nomination is watching his window fast close. The self-described democratic-socialist was the front-runner in the race for much of February – thanks to a partial victory in Iowa’s caucuses, an outright win in New Hampshire’s primary, and a shellacking of the rest of the Democratic field of contenders in Nevada’s caucuses. But over the last two and a half weeks, Sanders has watched Joe Biden zoom past him in the race for the presidential nomination. Following a landslide win in South Carolina’s primary and sweeping victories in the coast-to-coast Super Tuesday states as well as last week’s mini Super Tuesday, the former vice president cemented his position as the unrivaled front-runner and has taken a commanding lead over Sanders in the all-important race for convention delegates. At the same time, Biden’s seen a tidal wave of support and endorsements from current and former members of Congress, governors and state lawmakers and party rainmakers – as centrists, moderates, and the party establishment have all coalesced around the former vice president in hopes that they’ve found the contender who can take out President Trump in Novembers general election. The public opinion polls in all four states voting Tuesday indicate Biden enjoying large double-digit leads. And Sanders lost all four of the states four years ago to eventual 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton. PRIMARY PRIMER: PAST FLORIDA WINNERS With 219 pledged delegates at stake, Florida’s the biggest prize. Illinois has 155 delegates up for grabs, followed by Ohio at 136 and Arizona with 67. While Sanders scored points at Sunday night’s Democratic presidential nomination debate – he didn’t deliver a knockout blow to Biden that was needed to change the primary narrative that the independent senator’s living on borrowed time. If Tuesday’s primaries deliver another round of decisive victories by Biden, the chorus of calls for Sanders to step aside will grow louder. But Biden will still be short of the 1,991 pledged delegates needed to clinch the nomination. And with the primary calendar grinding to a halt after Tuesday's contests due to the coronavirus pandemic - there’s the possibility that Sanders could stay alive in a race that will be frozen in time.

"                          With many measures being taken to protect our physical health during the COVID-19 outbreak, our mental health becomes just as important. Here are some ways of coping with the increase in social isolation in response to the outbreak. We are all being tested, our political leaders most of all. As people and their neighborhoods grapple with shuttered schools, restaurants, churches and theaters, as well as bedlam conditions in grocery stores with depleted shelves, they would like to know their elected officials are working on plans to minimize the danger and the damage. As Wall Street had to halt trading yesterday for the third time in two weeks during another massive selloff, people want to know that there are strenuous efforts to stabilize the markets and the economy. NEW NORMAL: TOM HANKS, NBA FREEZE, STOCK SLIDE AND CONFUSION In a time of such high anxiety, the actions of Donald Trump, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, in a campaign that’s essentially been swallowed by the coronavirus, are illuminating. The most telling moment in the Democratic debate, held in a CNN Washington studio with no audience, was at the start. Biden projected empathy: “First of all, my heart goes out to those who have already lost someone and those who are suffering from the virus.  And this is bigger than any one of us.” Bernie attacked Trump: ""The first thing we’ve got to do, whether or not I’m president is to shut this president up right now because he is undermining the doctors and scientists who are trying to help the American people.” Biden, in vice-presidential fashion, said he’d call a meeting in the Situation Room. Sanders, in democratic socialist fashion, kept turning questions into a pitch for ""Medicare-for-All"" and attacks on dysfunctional insurers and greedy drugmakers. It was as though he had simply updated his talking points for the last year to reflect the virus crisis. And both candidates made unrealistic promises on the economic front. Biden: “No one loses their home, no one loses their paycheck.” Sanders: “No one is going to suffer...If you lose your job, you’ll be made whole.” Depending on the magnitude of the virus, that may simply be impossible. How would government determine who lost a job because of the virus as opposed to an overall recession? And where would the replacement jobs come from? The most heated exchange -- it was so, well, senatorial -- came when the two white-haired warriors battled over the Simpson-Bowles commission of 2010. Bernie was using it to show that Joe once considered (but never actually voted for) cuts to Social Security, because any deficit-reduction effort has to rein in entitlement spending in some fashion. Guys, we’re in a severe crisis. Nobody cares about a forgotten fight from a decade ago. Biden “won” because he remained sharp for two hours and Bernie, knowing he’s trailing badly, didn’t try to bloody him. Now they’re back to a virtual campaign both defined and hamstrung by the virus. As for Trump, there’s little question he’s improved his performance by taking the crisis more seriously and unveiling daily briefings where he speaks at the outset and then turns things over to Mike Pence, followed by Anthony Fauci and assorted medical experts. There’s also little question that our country lost valuable time as Trump minimized the crisis and failed to resolve the crucial delays in testing. SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES What’s puzzling now, as the world’s attention is focused on one issue, is why the president is picking other fights. He went after Hillary Clinton, his opponent of more than three years ago, cheering on a “great job” by Judicial Watch, which is seeking to depose her on the private e-mail survey and Benghazi. “Potentially a treasure trove,” Trump tweeted. He went after Chuck Schumer, saying, “Can’t believe they are not going after Schumer for the threats he made to our cherished United States Supreme Court, and our two great Justices...Pathetic!” The senator’s threat that Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch would pay a price on abortion was dumb, but that story played out weeks ago. Trump went after “the fake and corrupt news” for saying he exaggerated the status of a Google project to develop a website to aid virus testing. He then tweeted the same company statement that journalists have been citing, which says the effort is in the “early stages of development” and for now aimed only at the San Francisco area. And Trump said again that Mike Flynn had been treated unfairly and might get a “full pardon”--despite the fact that his former aide pleaded guilty to lying. We all know that the president loves to punch and counterpunch his political detractors. But it would be better for the country if, for now at least, he only had one target.

"                          With growing fears of the coronavirus pandemic, states have begun to respond by postponing their primary elections. Here are the states that have begun to take these initial steps. The spreading coronavirus outbreak has shut down more and more of American life — including schools, sporting events, bars, and now even elections. Multiple states have either announced they are postponing their presidential primary elections due to concerns about the novel coronavirus or made clear they are considering it. This comes after top election officials in Arizona, Florida, Ohio and Illinois issued a statement Friday saying they would go on with their Tuesday, March 17 elections, writing, ""Americans have participated in elections during challenging times in the past ... we are confident that voters in our states can safely and securely cast their ballots in this election."" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine backtracked Monday, announcing that his state health director will close down polls ""as a health emergency."" And Sunday night, in an interview after the CNN presidential debate that was held in a closed-off studio rather than in a hall with a live audience, presidential candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders hinted that it could be worth moving primary elections to protect against the coronavirus. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW TRAVELING DURING THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK: WHAT TO PACK ""I would hope that governors listen to the public health experts and what they are saying is … we don’t want gatherings of more than 50 people,” Sanders said. “I’m thinking about some of the elderly people sitting behind the desks, registering people and doing all that stuff. Does that make sense? I’m not sure it does."" Here are the states that are putting off their presidential primary elections: Louisiana Louisiana became the first state to postpone a primary or caucus on Friday, with Gov. John Bel Edwards signing an executive order to move the April 4 election to late June. ""Today I have certified that a state of emergency exists and requested that the governor issue an executive order postponing the elections this spring. We have requested postponing the April 4 primary election until June 20 and postponing the May 9 general election until July 25,"" Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin said. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES UNDER SIEGE AMID CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE: REPORT Christina Stephens, a spokeswoman for Edwards, said the move was to prevent further person-to-person transmission of the virus in Louisiana. ""We are experiencing community spread of coronavirus in Louisiana and the governor is taking decisive action to slow its progress,"" she said. Georgia Georgia also moved its elections from March 24 to May 19 on Saturday after Gov. Brian Kemp declared a state of emergency. LINDSAY GRAHAM TESTS NEGATIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS AS CONGRESS WORKS TO KEEP MEMBERS, STAFF HEALTHY ""Events are moving rapidly and my highest priority is protecting the health of our poll workers, their families, and the community at large,"" said Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Ohio Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine asked a judge Monday to allow his state to postpone its election, originally scheduled for Tuesday, March 17, to June 2. ""We cannot conduct this election tomorrow,” he stressed in an announcement on Monday. After the judge ruled that the election would have to go forward, DeWine announced that he would prevent polls from opening anyway, with his state health director closing down polls ""as a health emergency."" DEMOCRACY 2020 DIGEST: OHIO TO ORDER POLLS CLOSED OVER CORONAVIRUS 'EMERGENCY,' GOVERNOR SAYS DeWine said that the state's in-person voting would not conform with CDC guidelines for preventing the spread of the coronavirus, and vowed to find a way to hold a ""free and fair"" election without putting voters' health at risk. ""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,"" DeWine said in a statement. ""As such, Health Director Dr. Amy Acton will order the polls closed as a health emergency. While the polls will be closed tomorrow, Secretary of State Frank LaRose will seek a remedy through the courts to extend voting options so that every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity."" Officials in the other three states slated to have elections Tuesday -- Arizona, Florida and Illinois -- confirmed Monday that they would still go through with their plans. Kentucky On recommendation from Kentucky Secretary of State Michael G. Adams, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear pushed back that state's primary from May 19 to June 23. ""I never would have imagined sitting here discussing this with you, but these are unprecedented times,"" Adams said in a video posted to Twitter. ""And we Kentuckians are having to change the way we do things on all fronts. Kentucky law allows the secretary of state and the governor to jointly act to change the time of an election due to a state of emergency."" He continued: ""Postponing the primary was not an easy decision, but the Republican secretary of state and Democratic governor agree, and so do county clerks of both parties, and they are our frontline election administrators. My hope is that this delay will allow us to have a normal election. Even if not, this delay will allow me, the state board of elections and our county clerks time to assess what changes we must make to ensure a successful primary election. There could be more changes, but this was a first step to buy is time and keep our citizens as safe as possible. We'll get through this."" Kentucky was originally slated to have one of the latest primaries of any state, with only five states and Washington, D.C., voting after it. This move by Kentucky throws into question almost the entire 2020 primary calendar, especially after President Trump's comments Monday that the coronavirus pandemic could last until July or August in the United States. Puerto Rico Though it is not a state, Puerto Rico holds primaries for both parties. The Puerto Rico Republican primary already took place on March 8, but the Puerto Rico Democratic Party last week requested that the state delay its Democratic primary, which was scheduled for March 29.

"                          President Trump gives coronavirus update from White House. With Congress, the Supreme Court, sports leagues, schools and many businesses and companies across America shutting down, only time will tell if we are being appropriately cautious or engaging in a hysterical overreaction to the coronavirus. But for those imaginative reporters who see a Russian lurking behind every tree and keep asking me if President Trump can use this pandemic as an excuse to delay the 2020 presidential election, the answer is “no.” Under our Constitution, the executive branch has no authority whatsoever to delay, reschedule or otherwise change the federal election in November, much less any of the remaining state primaries. On the other hand, Congress and the states do have that authority. Congress has no authority over state elections or party primaries other than the requirements under federal statutes like the Voting Rights Act and various constitutional amendments that prohibit states from discriminating or limiting access to the voting process. But when it comes to setting the dates for political party primaries or general elections for state officials, including presidential primaries, or how you are able to vote (in-person or by mail), the federal government has no power to dictate the time, place or manner of those state elections. DR. QANTA AHMED: BORDERS MATTER IN CORONAVIRUS FIGHT – TRAVEL BANS BOUGHT US PRECIOUS TIME State governments can certainly change the dates of their presidential primaries or whatever other state primaries they are holding.  In some states such as Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia, governors are provided with emergency authority to take such actions without the approval of their state legislatures. In Florida, for example, the governor has the power under state law to suspend or delay an election by issuing an executive order declaring a state of emergency, although a new election must then be held within 10 days or as soon as practicable thereafter. That actually happened in New York because of the 9/11 attacks. New York was holding a primary on Sept. 11, 2001. In fact, a political unknown named Michael Bloomberg was running in the GOP primary for mayor of New York City. Polls opened at 6 a.m. but voting was suspended statewide by Gov. George Pataki after the attacks. A new election was held two weeks later. State governments can certainly change the dates of their presidential primaries or whatever other state primaries they are holding.  But the federal government cannot change the date of such state primaries. Given that all 50 states and the District of Columbia allow voters to vote with absentee ballots, which can be easily obtained, completed and mailed without anyone ever leaving their house, there seems little reason to do so. The cancellation and delay in the New York primary because of the 9/11 attacks on Election Day itself was an extraordinary event necessitated by unique and tragic circumstances. That is not the current situation. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Congress does have the authority under Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution to step in and change state laws and rules when it wants to with regard to the “Times, Places and Manner” of congressional elections. Congress has set the date for election of all members of the House of Representatives on the “Tuesday next after the 1st Monday in November, in every even numbered year.” Federal law sets the same day for the election of U.S. senators whose terms are expiring. Similarly, under Article II, Section 1, Congress has the authority to set the “Time of chusing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes, which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.” Since it is the Electoral College that selects our president, Congress has the power to determine when our general federal election occurs where voters vote for slates of presidential electors in their respective states. Congress has set the date for that vote on the same day as congressional elections, the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Those electors chosen by voters then cast their votes for president on the “first Monday after the second Wednesday in December.” None of these federal statutes has any provision allowing the president or any other executive branch official or agency to change the date of the election even in an emergency, whether it is the threat of a disease like the coronavirus or a terrorist attack. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP On the other hand, Congress does have the authority to do so if both the House and the Senate pass an amendment to these laws and the president signs it into law. That amendment could either change the date of the election or delegate to the president the ability to change the date under certain emergency conditions, similar to the authority some governors are given under state laws. But without that happening – and it is highly unlikely given the fact that neither party controls both houses of Congress – we are having a federal election on Nov. 3 no matter what happens with the coronavirus.

"                          Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin explains what the emergency coronavirus bill includes and when we can expect the big economic recovery package White House officials and congressional lawmakers are signaling they will attempt to push through a third coronavirus spending package worth hundreds of billions of dollars even as the Senate works to move along the more modest second relief bill that focuses on leave for workers and expedited testing for the disease officially known as COVID-19. Fox News has learned that the White House specifically is pushing an $850 billion stimulus, largely in the form of tax relief measures. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW Roughly $500 billion of this would be tied to a payroll tax cut, while $250 billion would come in the form of Small Business Administration loans and another $58 billion would be directed to the airline industry, among other measures. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will attend the Senate GOP's weekly policy lunch Tuesday -- which will take place in a larger room that it usually does so the senators can practice social distancing -- to discuss the details of the comprehensive coronavirus proposal from the White House. ""I’m not going to comment on the numbers now. But it’s a big number,"" Mnuchin told reporters Monday night. The Washington Post first reported Tuesday morning that Mnuchin's proposal would come with the $850 billion price tag. The Post, citing anonymous sources, reported that Mnuchin's proposal would focus mainly on putting cash in the hands of individuals and businesses. CAN NEWBORN BABIES CONTRACT CORONAVIRUS AND PASS IT TO OTHERS? Meanwhile, Senate Democrats will hold their weekly lunch via conference call instead, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer likely going over the details of a huge $750 billion proposal he announced Monday ""to wage war against coronavirus and the economic crisis facing Americans."" ""As early as tomorrow, I will present a series of proposals to Congressional appropriators that Senate Democrats believe should be part of the next bill to address the coronavirus,"" Schumer said in floor remarks Monday. ""In consultation with the ranking members of the committees of jurisdiction, we are proposing an immediate and initial infusion of at least $750 billion to wage war against COVID-19 and the economic crisis it is now causing."" BRIT HUME: TRUMP'S CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE A 'MIXED BAG,' NOT AT 10 OUT OF 10 Following President Trump's signing of an initial coronavirus-related spending bill worth $8.3 billion last week, the House of Representatives okayed a second bill early Saturday morning that it adjusted Monday to correct technical errors. The Senate is expected to act on the House proposal Tuesday and will need to approve both the original bill and the correction to avoid sending the legislation back to the House, which has a significant portion of its members out of town on their previously scheduled district work period. Schumer said that his proposal will include expanded unemployment insurance and Medicaid funding, address strained capacity at hospitals, provide urgent assistance to small businesses, assist schools in transitioning to remote learning as more and more states close down their public schools for the foreseeable future, among other measures. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., backed Schumer's call for a $750 billion arsenal to battle the coronavirus and its economic effects in an op-ed for CNN Monday. MNUCHIN SAYS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION NOT PUSHING BAILOuTS AS HE SEEKS TO CALM ECONOMIC ANXIETIES ON FOX NEWS SUNDAY ""The US is heading toward a recession, and Speaker Pelosi has already announced plans for an additional emergency response package,"" she wrote. ""This is the right approach. We must act quickly to enact a major fiscal stimulus package that wards off economic disaster."" It is unclear what exactly will be in Mnuchin's proposal to Senate Republicans but there is a chance there could be significant overlap with Schumer's ideas -- Mnuchin has been the White House's point person in negotiating with congressional Democrats and spoke with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi more than 20 times on Friday as she and the Trump administration hashed out the chamber's initial version of the second coronavirus deal. In an interview with Chris Wallace on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Mnuchin pitched ""a big stimulus program because we need to help American workers now."" The Treasury secretary made clear, however, that he and the president are not asking for a bailout. ""If you're providing liquidity to good businesses that just need liquidity for 3 to 6 months,"" he said, ""that's not a bailout."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Mnuchin continued: ""Whatever we need, we are gonna get from Congress."" Other lawmakers have chimed in with ideas for how to combat the coronavirus and help Americans who are harmed by the virtual economic shutdown it is triggering. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, Monday proposed, among other things, providing every American with a $1,000 check to cover expenses they may incur due to layoffs, forced leave or other coronavirus-related expenses. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, came out with a similar proposal last week, introduced in a nonbinding House resolution, to provide each American with a monthly $1,000 payment until the coronavirus threat is over. She termed it a ""temporary universal basic payment."" Both her proposal and Romney's appear similar to former Democratic presidential contender Andrew Yang's universal basic income (UBI) idea, but are distinguished from it mainly because their ideas are temporary, stopgap measures.

Mike DeWine stressed. While the polls will be closed in Ohio, contests in Arizona, Florida, and Illinois – will go forward on Tuesday.  And that could give Democratic presidential nomination front-runner Joe Biden a chance to deliver a potential knockout blow to Sen. Bernie Sanders – who’s fighting to avoid elimination from the White House race. “This primary is far from over,” Sanders stressed in an email to supporters on the eve of the March 17 contests. But in reality – the progressive senator from Vermont who’s making his second straight bid for the Democratic nomination is watching his window fast close. The self-described democratic-socialist was the front-runner in the race for much of February – thanks to a partial victory in Iowa’s caucuses, an outright win in New Hampshire’s primary, and a shellacking of the rest of the Democratic field of contenders in Nevada’s caucuses. But over the last two and a half weeks, Sanders has watched Joe Biden zoom past him in the race for the presidential nomination. Following a landslide win in South Carolina’s primary and sweeping victories in the coast-to-coast Super Tuesday states as well as last week’s mini Super Tuesday, the former vice president cemented his position as the unrivaled front-runner and has taken a commanding lead over Sanders in the all-important race for convention delegates. At the same time, Biden’s seen a tidal wave of support and endorsements from current and former members of Congress, governors and state lawmakers and party rainmakers – as centrists, moderates, and the party establishment have all coalesced around the former vice president in hopes that they’ve found the contender who can take out President Trump in Novembers general election. The public opinion polls in all the states voting Tuesday indicate Biden enjoying large double-digit leads. And Sanders lost all four of them four years ago to eventual 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton. PRIMARY PRIMER: PAST FLORIDA WINNERS With 219 pledged delegates at stake, Florida’s the biggest prize. Illinois has 155 delegates up for grabs, and Arizona 67. Ohio, which is postponing it's primaray day voting, has 136 pledged delegates. While Sanders scored points at Sunday night’s Democratic presidential nomination debate – he didn’t deliver a knockout blow to Biden that was needed to change the primary narrative that the independent senator’s living on borrowed time. If Tuesday’s primaries deliver another round of decisive victories by Biden, the chorus of calls for Sanders to step aside will grow louder. But Biden will still be short of the 1,991 pledged delegates needed to clinch the nomination. And with the primary calendar grinding to a halt after Tuesday's contests due to the coronavirus pandemic - there’s the possibility that Sanders could stay alive in a race that will be frozen in time.

"                          The Trump campaign files a libel lawsuit against New York Times for the paper's March 27, 2019 op-ed titled ‘The Real Trump-Russia Quid Pro Quo;’ reaction and analysis from ‘Media Buzz’ host Howard Kurtz. In a striking and unexpected abandonment of a once-heralded prosecution initiated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, the Justice Department moved Monday to drop charges against two Russian companies that were accused of funding a social media meme campaign to further their “strategic goal to sow discord in the U.S. political system, including the 2016 presidential election.” Late Monday, with jury selection in the case set to begin in just two weeks, a federal judge granted the DOJ's motion to kill the prosecution for several counts of conspiring to defraud U.S. agencies tasked with combating election interference. The government acknowledged the Russian companies were never likely to actually face punishment anyway and cited possible national security risks with going forward to trial. Concord Management and Consulting LLC and Concord Catering were among three companies and 13 individuals charged in February 2018 by Mueller. Their alleged criminal effort included social media postings and campaigns aimed at dividing American public opinion and sowing discord in the electorate, officials said, although no impact on voters was ever demonstrated. Of the 13 Russians and three Russian companies charged by Mueller in the social media disinformation effort, Concord was the sole defendant to enter an appearance in Washington’s federal court and contest and the allegations. Mueller's 37-page indictment said the actions detailed by prosecutors dated back to 2014. (Mueller later brought separate charges in the summer of 2018 against other entities related to a hack of Democrats' emails.) READ THE DOJ'S MOTION TO DROP CHARGES President Trump noted that no Russian collusion with his campaign was ever proven, and Republicans and even left-of-center commenators argued that Russian disinformation was mostly irrelevant, given that social media and other platforms are already rife with inaccuracies. ""Before a pandemic, there was a time when we were relentlessly told to fear Russian social media accounts,"" mused journalist Aaron Mate on Monday. ""Their juvenile memes not only elected Trump, but also 'sowed chaos.' When Mueller indicted 13 Russians over it, he was hailed as a hero. Well, DOJ just dropped the case."" Various media outlets had hyped the indictment, with NPR calling the Russians' activities an ""attack"" on democracy.  ""For me, personally, hearing these charges and hearing what they were charging these Russians for -- it was the first time that I felt like finally, finally, for the first time since we realized all this was happened, finally, it feels like someone is defending us,"" MSNBC host Rachel Maddow said at the time, seemingly holding back tears. Concord is controlled by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a wealthy businessman known as “Putin’s chef” for his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. He has been hit with U.S. sanctions over Russian interference in the 2016 election and is charged alongside his company in the indictment brought by Mueller.

(Sergei Ilnitsky/Pool Photo via AP, File)       The company, with the help of a high-powered law firm, filed a series of motions over the last two years, including to dismiss charges and to exclude certain evidence from the case. In January 2019, prosecutors said confidential material from the Russia investigation, which had been handed over to defense attorneys for Concord, was altered and released online as part of a disinformation campaign to discredit the special counsel's Russia investigation. READ MUELLER'S INITIAL INDICTMENT The files surfaced online in a link posted by a pro-Russia Twitter account. But the Justice Department stopped short of accusing Concord of leaking the material. Still, they argued that the company’s request to have sensitive new evidence sent to Russia “unreasonably risks the national security interests of the United States.”       Special Counsel Robert Mueller announced the prosecution of Russian trolls in 2018; that prosecution is now dropped. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File)       Some of the court appearances in the case have been unusually contentious, with the federal judge overseeing it chastising a lawyer for the company, Eric Dubelier, for references in court filings to Looney Tunes and the 1978 raunchy comedy “Animal House” to criticize the Mueller investigation. “I’ll say it plain and simply: Knock it off,” U.S District Judge Dabney Friedrich told Dubelier at a January 2019 court appearance. Dubelier, who has referred to the case as involving a “made up” crime, has made allegations of prosecutorial misconduct and even once accused the judge of bias. JUDGE SLAMS DNC OVER LAWSUIT AGAINST TRUMP CAMP, SAYS NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION ""The real Department of Justice"" never would have brought the case,"" Dubelier said at one 2018 hearing. At another point, he curtly rejected a DOJ summons, saying prosecutors ""are already behaving in a manner that is inconsistent with the practices of the DOJ."" He also accused the DOJ of having ""indicted the proverbial ham sandwich."" And, the Twitter user Techno Fog observed that Dubelier also flatly accused one of Mueller's prosecutors of being a liar. But with the case approaching trial, prosecutors beat a hasty retreat, and said they had to weigh the risk of potentially exposing sensitive national security information against the benefits of continuing with the case against a company that likely wouldn’t face any significant punishment in the United States. In the court filing on Monday, prosecutors said Concord had been “eager and aggressive in using the judicial system to gather information about how the United States detects and prevents foreign election interference.” “In short, Concord has demonstrated its intent to reap the benefits of the Court’s jurisdiction while positioning itself to evade any real obligations or responsibility,” prosecutors wrote in Monday’s filing. “It is no longer in the best interests of justice or the country’s national security to continue this prosecution."" At the same time, Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers and U.S. Attorney for Washington Timothy Shea defended the initial indictment. ""There is a substantial federal interest in defending American democratic institutions, exposing those who endeavor to criminally interfere with them, and holding them accountable, which is why this prosecution was properly commenced in the first place,"" the prosecutors said. They added: ""In light of the defendant’s conduct, however, its ephemeral presence and immunity to just punishment, the risk of exposure of law enforcement’s tools and techniques, and the post-indictment change in the proof available at trial, the balance of equities has shifted."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Concord Catering did not have attorneys appear in court, but prosecutors said they would seek to drop charges against that company as well because it too was controlled by Prigozhin and “based on the likelihood that its approach to litigation would be the same as Concord.” Prosecutors vowed to continue to pursue their case against the 13 Russians who were named in Mueller's indictment, along with the troll farm that Concord was alleged to have funded, the Internet Research Agency.

"                          Dr. Marc Siegel answers questions from 'Fox &amp; Friends' viewers. The top lawyer for Democrats during the House impeachment inquiry has confirmed that he tested positive for the novel coronavirus — while simultaneously accusing the Trump administration of being “shockingly unprepared” for the pandemic. Daniel Goldman, who conducted much of the questioning for House Intelligence Committee Democrats during the impeachment inquiry last year, tweeted Sunday that he has COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. FOREIGN DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN ON FAKE NATIONAL QUARANTINE TRYING TO CAUSE PANIC, TRUMP ADMIN OFFICIALS SAY  “My #COVID19 test came back positive. I want to thank everyone for the outpouring of support. It means a lot to my family and me,” he tweeted. “I am almost back to 100%. I’m lucky enough not to fall in the vulnerable category and, for me, it was just like the flu.” Goldman went on to describe his “difficulty in getting a test despite the exact symptoms and a neg flu test” which he said “underscores how shockingly unprepared this administration is to deal with this pandemic.” “@realDonaldTrump can try to gaslight the American public by repeatedly saying that everyone who needs a test can get one, but that was not true one month ago (when it should have been the case) and it is not true today (when there is no excuse),” Goldman tweeted, noting that his wife, despite having symptoms, was unable to be tested in New York City hospitals unless she was admitted. “Given his stated desire to ‘keep numbers down’ for his political benefit, it is impossible to reach any conclusion other than the President is sacrificing the health of the American public for his own personal interests,” Goldman continued. Trump has been criticized for initially downplaying the outbreak, but on Monday the president struck a more somber and serious tone as he urged Americans to take a range of precautions to curb the spread of the virus. He also defended his administration's response, self-assigning a score of 10 out of 10. “I’d rate it a 10,” Trump said, pointing to an early China travel ban. “I think we’ve done a great job. ... We were very, very early with respect to China and we would have a whole different situation in this country if we didn’t do that.” Last week, Goldman began tweeting about his symptoms, and noting that “unless you have pneumonia and traveled to one of the 5 high-risk countries recently, you can NOT get a #COVID19 test in New York City.” Goldman went to Weill Cornell Hospital in New York City last week and tweeted about the “overflowing ER” while he awaited results for six hours of what he described as “another flu test” and chest x-ray, because he was not “eligible” for the COVID-19 test because his symptoms were “not bad enough to be admitted.” Goldman traveled to Stamford, Conn., a suburb outside of New York City, for a curbside coronavirus test last week, but was told that the results would not come back for four days. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., announced Sunday that a former staffer had tested positive, and that he and his office would follow recommendations of the House attending physician. ""Medical professionals believe that my former staff member likely contracted the virus after leaving the office, but we will still be taking additional precautions over the next few days,"" Schiff said in a statement. ""The former staffer is feeling better and no current staff have reported any flu-like symptoms at this time."" Goldman later publicly tweeted that it was him. Goldman's last day on Capitol Hill was March 6. Meanwhile, Goldman tweeted encouraging the public to ""listen to the experts"" to slow the spread. The World Health Organization (WHO) designated coronavirus, or COVID-19, a pandemic last week. President Trump announced a national emergency on Friday. The president also announced a temporary halt on air travel to the United States from Europe, now including flights from the United Kingdom, but excluding those carrying cargo. The announcement came as major sporting and other events were called off or postponed, businesses across the country instituted telework policies, government buildings and schools shuttered and other disruptions rocked the nation, amid efforts to curb the transmission of the virus. As of Tuesday morning, there were more than 4,660 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States, in 49 states, including Washington, D.C. The U.S., so far, has seen 85 coronavirus-related deaths. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to WHO, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.

"                          Reaction from Arizona GOP chairwoman Dr. Kelli Ward. Kentucky Gov. Andrew Beshear and Secretary of State Michael G. Adams on Monday postponed the state's primary elections, which originally were scheduled for May 19, to June 23 amid concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. The state becomes the latest in a rapidly growing number to put off their primaries, throwing into question the rest of the 2020 election calendar -- even as voters in three states head to the polls Tuesday. ""I never would have imagined sitting here discussing this with you, but these are unprecedented times,"" Adams said in a video posted to Twitter. ""And we Kentuckians are having to change the way we do things on all fronts. Kentucky law allows the secretary of state and the governor to jointly act to change the time of an election due to a state of emergency."" Only five states and Washington, D.C., originally were scheduled to hold primary elections after Kentucky's May 19 date. The move by Beshear, a Democrat, and Adams, a Republican, could be repeated by officials in states with even earlier primaries in the days ahead. ""Postponing the primary was not an easy decision, but the Republican secretary of state and Democratic governor agree, and so do county clerks of both parties, and they are our frontline election administrators,"" Adams said. ""My hope is that this delay will allow us to have a normal election. Even if not, this delay will allow me, the state board of elections and our county clerks time to assess what changes we must make to ensure a successful primary election. There could be more changes, but this was a first step, to buy us time and keep our citizens as safe as possible. We'll get through this."" CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW ARIZONA, ILLINOIS AND FLORIDA PRIMARIES MOVE FORWARD DESPITE COVID-19 FEARS Kentucky's move comes after a lawsuit by Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine earlier Monday to postpone his state's primaries, first scheduled for Tuesday, to June 2. DeWine filed a lawsuit in state court moving to change the election date but it was denied. He later had his state health director Dr. Amy Action order polls closed anyway ""as a health emergency"" and tasked his secretary of state with working in the courts to officially move the election date so Ohioans could have ""free and fair"" elections without the risk of catching the coronavirus. The Ohio Supreme Court, in a ruling without an opinion Tuesday morning, denied a last-second effort to force the state to move ahead with the Tuesday elections, giving further legitimacy to DeWine's 11th-hour maneuver. Arizona, Florida and Illinois will all hold their presidential primary elections as scheduled on Tuesday. Ohio previously had joined with the other three states in committing to hold their elections as scheduled, but DeWine, who has been one of the most active governors in fighting the coronavirus, stepped in. He said there was no way the state could make its polling places comply with federal guidelines for limiting gatherings in such a short timeframe.

Those guidelines included limiting any gatherings to 10 people or fewer, keeping an entire household at home if one person inside tests positive for the coronavirus and washing hands frequently.

"                          Four states will go to the voting booths on March 17. Here’s how many democratic delegates are at stake in each of the states. Democratic voters will head to the polls Tuesday to vote in the party's first set of primaries after voters have the chance to see the last two remaining contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination -- former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders -- go head-to-head in a debate. Biden has taken control of the race after wins in 10 states on Super Tuesday and at least four states last Tuesday. He now holds a significant delegate lead over Sanders in what became essentially a one-on-one race after billionaire Mike Bloomberg and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren exited the race following Super Tuesday. Sanders admitted the March 10 primaries were not a good night for his campaign while saying he would stay in the race for the Democratic nomination on Wednesday. The March 17 races, which award 15 percent of all delegates in the Democratic primary and will bring the number of delegates awarded in the Democratic race to 61 percent of the total delegates available, could be Sanders' last stand.       Democratic voters will head to the polls for the first time Tuesday after seeing Sanders and Biden go head-to-head in a debate.       BIDEN HOLDS MASSIVE LEAD OVER SANDERS IN FLORIDA: POLL Here are the states voting and the delegates at stake on Tuesday, March 17. Arizona There are 67 pledged delegates at stake in Arizona's Democratic presidential primary. The results in Arizona will be an important indicator, as Sanders has typically fared better in western states while Biden has excelled in more diverse states. Arizona, sitting on the U.S. southern border, is both western and diverse. Florida Florida is the biggest prize available on March 17, awarding 219 pledged delegates in all. A diverse swing state, a good performance in Florida will help Sanders or Biden make the case that they are the most electable Democrat to face President Trump in November. Illinois The home state of former President Barack Obama, Illinois will dole out 155 pledged delegates on March 17. Sanders laid some groundwork in Illinois earlier in the primary, visiting the state for three days to Biden's one as of March 11. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Ohio (Postponed) Ohio originally was scheduled to have its primaries on March 17 before Gov. Mike DeWine announced a lawsuit Monday to push back the date to June 2. A judge ruled against DeWine's suit but the governor announced that his state health director would prevent polls from opening anyway and that his secretary of state would work in the courts to set a new election date. ""We cannot conduct this election tomorrow,” he stressed in an announcement on Monday. ""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,"" DeWine said in a statement after the judge had ruled against his suit to postpone the election. ""As such, Health Director Dr. Amy Acton will order the polls closed as a health emergency. While the polls will be closed tomorrow, Secretary of State Frank LaRose will seek a remedy through the courts to extend voting options so that every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity."" The Ohio Supreme Court, in a ruling without an opinion Tuesday morning, denied a last-second effort to force the state to move ahead with the Tuesday elections, giving further legitimacy to DeWine's 11th-hour maneuver. While Ohio only has the third-most delegates of the four March 17 states, a win in the ever-important general election swing state -- whenever it holds its election -- could help Biden make himself seem even more like the inevitable nominee or help Sanders revive his campaign. The state will award 136 total delegates. Fox News' Paul Steinhauser and Ellison Barber contributed to this report.

The development comes not only as Biden moves closer to the nomination but as protesters have disrupted several recent events -- even rushing the stage and prompting staff and family members to intervene to help protect the candidate. PLUG PULLED ON BIDEN 'VIRTUAL TOWN HALL' AFTER TECHNICAL GLITCHES The law enforcement source described a multi-stage approval process, telling Fox News that a candidate first needs to qualify for protection, then request it from a select congressional committee and the Department of Homeland Security. Once approved, the U.S. Secret Service is authorized to protect the individual. Biden's rival for the Democratic nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has not yet had Secret Service protection activated, the source told Fox News. It is rare for official protection to be given to candidates before they officially get their party’s nomination, but the Secret Service makes exceptions based on threats. For example, in 2015, the Secret Service activated 24-hour protection for then-candidate Donald Trump and then-candidate Ben Carson after both received threats; and then-Sen. Barack Obama received protection in 2007, long before he secured the nomination, amid an uptick in threats against him. But former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had Secret Service protection dating back to her days as first lady, and had that protection on the presidential campaign trail in 2016. Biden, as vice president, also had Secret Service protection. While it is unclear, at this point, if the Biden campaign has received any sort of threat, earlier this month, the former vice president had protesters storm the stage during a victory speech. 'LET DAIRY DIE' PROTESTERS STORM STAGE DURING BIDEN SUPER TUESDAY VICTORY SPEECH Two female protesters rushed the stage, shouting: ""Let dairy die."" They held posters reading the same and showing the image of a cow. Dr. Jill Biden, and Biden’s sister, Valerie, attempted to block the protesters from touching the former vice president. Campaign senior adviser Symone Sanders immediately hit the stage, grabbing a protester. The other protester was dragged off the stage by security. Biden continued on with his speech. Sanders tweeted, later, saying: ""I broke a nail. #SuperTuesday""    ",         Biden gets Secret Service protection source,         2020-03-17T100921-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/biden-to-receive-secret-service-protection,Fox
"                          Ellison Barber reports from Columbus, Ohio after in-person voting is postponed. The Ohio Supreme Court, in an early-morning order, declined an 11th-hour request to force the state to move forward with its primary elections that were originally scheduled for Tuesday but postponed on Monday by Gov. Mike DeWine due to the coronavirus threat. The court was responding to a request for a writ of mandamus -- a judicial order that a government official do his or her job a certain way -- and called for arguments from the government on why it could not hold the election with a compressed deadline of 1:30 a.m. Tuesday. It then ruled against granting the writ early Tuesday morning without issuing a full opinion. Three of the seven judges on Ohio's Supreme Court -- DeWine's son, Pat DeWine, and two others who are running for reelection -- declined to participate in the ruling, meaning just a bare majority of the court was even hearing the case. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW MARCH 17 PRIMARIES: HERE ARE THE STATES VOTING AND THE DELEGATES AT STAKE By simply declining to issue a writ of mandamus, the Ohio Supreme Court is not necessarily saying what DeWine is doing is legal or that the lower court that ruled against DeWine on Monday -- prompting DeWine to announce he would close polls anyway -- was wrong. All it is doing is declining to tell DeWine what to do. It is unclear that DeWine would have complied with a writ ordering him to hold the Tuesday elections given his dedication to stopping the coronavirus pandemic in his state and his previous refusal to follow a court order saying the election should go forward. ""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,"" DeWine said after the lower court ruled against him Monday. Secretary of State Frank LaRose defended the decision to postpone the election in Tuesday morning comments. ""There's no question in my mind that the action that the governor took is allowed under the law,"" LaRose said, citing a provision in Ohio law that gives the state health director broad powers to prevent the spread of disease. ""There will be litigation. My team is prepared to argue that. I know that the governor's team is as well."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Nevertheless, the highest court in Ohio has at the very least refused to rule against DeWine, at minimum adding some legal legitimacy to his poll closure. DeWine has asked LaRose to work through the courts to find a solution so that Ohioans can have ""free and fair"" elections without risk of contracting the coronavirus. DeWine originally sought to move the Ohio primary back to June 2, though it is unclear if that will be the end result of what has become a rather messy legal scenario.

"                          Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf joins Laura Ingraham with insight on 'The Ingraham Angle.' President Trump and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo are trading barbs over the coronavirus  response, with the president telling the Democratic governor Tuesday to “keep politics out of it.” “Cuomo wants ‘all states to be treated the same. But all states aren’t the same,” Trump tweeted Tuesday. “Some are being hit hard by the Chinese Virus, some are being hit practically not at all.” CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK SPURS NY, NJ, CT TO SHUT BARS, RESTAURANTS, GYMS Trump added: “New York is a very big ‘hotspot’, West Virginia has, thus far, zero cases.” “Andrew, keep politics out of it…” Trump tweeted. Trump’s post came after he tweeted Monday night about a teleconference he had conducted with governors across the country, saying it went well but claiming Cuomo has to ""do more."" Cuomo, a frequent critic of Trump, fired back Monday night. “I have to do more? No—YOU have to do something!” Cuomo tweeted. “You’re supposed to be the President.” He added: “Happy to do your job, too. Just give me control of the Army Corps of Engineers and I’ll take it from there.” The back-and-forth between Trump and Cuomo comes as the nation is grappling with what was designated last week by the World Health Organization as a global pandemic. As of Tuesday morning, there were more than 4,660 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States, in 49 states, including Washington, D.C. The U.S., so far, has seen 85 coronavirus-related deaths. New York, at this point, is considered the state with the highest number of confirmed cases in the country, with nearly 1,000 individuals having tested positive for the virus. Meanwhile, Trump also slammed Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat who delivered the rebuttal to Trump's State of the Union last month. The governor, whose state is not at this point one of the most impacted, earlier had called on the federal government to do more in response to the pandemic. ""Failing Michigan Governor must work harder and be much more proactive. We are pushing her to get the job done. I stand with Michigan!"" Trump tweeted. He went on to tout the administration's response to coronavirus, and their work with states and localities to halt the spread. ""Federal Government is working very well with the Governors and State officials. Good things will happen! #KILLTHEVIRUS,"" he tweeted. Trump announced a national emergency on Friday. The president also announced a temporary halt on air travel to the United States from Europe, now including flights from the United Kingdom, but excluding those carrying cargo. The announcement came as major sporting and other events were called off or postponed, businesses across the country instituted telework policies, government buildings and schools shuttered and other disruptions rocked the nation, amid efforts to curb the transmission of the virus. On Monday, Cuomo, Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy collectively decided to shutter bars, restaurants, movie theaters and gyms in the tri-state area in an attempt to halt the growing number of cases in the region. They also said they would limit crowd capacity for recreational and social gatherings to 50 people. ""Our primary goal right now is to slow the spread of this virus so that the wave of new infections doesn't crash our health care system, and everyone agrees social distancing is the best way to do that,"" Cuomo said in a statement. ""This is not a war that can be won alone, which is why New York is partnering with our neighboring states to implement a uniform standard that not only keeps our people safe but also prevents 'state shopping' where residents of one state travel to another and vice versa.""

"                          President Trump announces the expansion of Medicare Telehealth Services and states HIPAA penalties will not be enforced Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday that the Trump administration wants to send checks to Americans “in the next two weeks” in an effort to help people cope with the economic cost of the coronavirus pandemic. “We’re looking at sending checks to Americans immediately,” Mnuchin said during a press briefing from the White House. “Americans need cash now, the president wants to get cash now. I mean now—in the next few weeks.” WHITE HOUSE EYES MASSIVE $850B STIMULUS PACKAGE NEXT, AS SENATE MOVES ON LATEST CORONAVIRUS BILL As the White House held its press conference Tuesday -- with President Trump, Vice President Pence, Mnuchin and the coronavirus task force present -- the Dow rallied 1,000 points, after sustaining historic losses on Monday. “The president has instructed me we have to this now,” Mnuchin added, though did not give specifics, except to say that the amount would be significant and that millionaires would not receive it. Mnuchin’s comments came as the White House is in negotiations with lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Congress to approve a sweeping economic stimulus package to help U.S. businesses and taxpayers deal with the economic fallout from the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus. CLICK FOR THE CORONAVIRUS GUIDELINES RELEASED BY THE WHITE HOUSE Mnuchin, on Tuesday, also announced that the Treasury Department would not extend the deadline to file taxes by the April 15 deadline, as much of the tax filing can be done online. “We encourage Americans who can file taxes to continue to file taxes on April 15 because for many Americans, you will get tax refunds and we don’t want you to lose out on those tax refunds,” Mnuchin said. Mnuchin added that if individuals or corporations owe money to the Internal Revenue Service after filing their taxes, those payments now are able to be deferred for up to 90 days interest-free. “If you owe a payment to the IRS, you can defer up to $1 million as an individual, and $10 million to corporations, interest-free and penalty-free for 90 days,” Mnuchin continued. “File your taxes, you’ll automatically not get charged interests or penalties.” Mnuchin is planning to outline a nearly $850 billion package during a lunch with Senate Republicans Tuesday, which Trump administration officials hope to have approved by the end of this week. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, opening the Senate on Tuesday morning, promised swift action. ""The Senate will not adjourn until we have passed significant and bold new steps above and beyond what the House has passed to help our strong nation and our strong underlying economy weather this storm,"" McConnell said. The Trump administration’s stimulus package is bigger than the 2008 bank bailout, and the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which was passed and signed under former President Barack Obama, and totaled $787 billion to help stabilize the economy about 14 months after the last recession began. Trump, during the press briefing Tuesday, said there was “great spirit” among lawmakers with regard to the plan. “I can say that for Republicans and Democrats.” Meanwhile, the president and the coronavirus task force, which is led by Vice President Pence, touted the administration’s progress on testing for COVID-19. Also on Tuesday, the president announced that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has announced new policies to increase testing. “We have tremendous testing capacity,” Trump said. Pence said that testing is now available in all 50 states, and announced that “state health authorities can now authorize labs in their state and expand existing testing capabilities.” Pence also said the administration has continued to expand its “public-private partnership” with “vast commercial labs around the country,” which he said is “increasing access to coronavirus testing.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “This is greatly expanding access, even as we speak,” Pence said Tuesday. “It is important that the American people understand that testing is happening all around the country,” Pence said, adding that experts “want me to tell the American people that you don’t need the testing to know what you should do.” “Experts say that if every American acts on the coronavirus guidelines, we can see a substantial reduction in the spread, but as the president said, it will take all of us to do it,” Pence said, noting those guidelines rolled out by the White House and CDC Monday which included social distancing, limiting social gatherings to groups of less than 10 individuals, and staying at home. “For the American people, as a whole, the risk of serious illness remains low,” Pence said. The president weighed in on the guidelines, adding that he “would recommend that people enjoy their living rooms,” and urged young people to do their part. One guideline, specifically, states that: “If you are an older person, stay home and away from other people.” Another states: “If you are a person with a serious underlying health condition that can put you at increased risk (for example, a condition that impairs your lungs or heart function or weakens your immune system), stay home and away from other people.” “We have to fight that invisible enemy, I guess unknown, but we’re getting to know it much better,” Trump said of the virus. “We are looking to save a maximum number of lives.” The president also announced that he has been having open conversations with governors across the nation, leaders in the fast-food, pharmaceutical and grocery industries; and will meet with leaders of the tourism industry on Tuesday. “We’re taking aggressive action now as one nation and one family so that America can rebound stronger frankly, stronger than ever,” he said. The World Health Organization designated COVID-19 a global pandemic last week. Trump announced a national emergency on Friday. The president also announced a temporary halt on air travel to the United States from Europe, now including flights from the United Kingdom, but excluding those carrying cargo. When asked Tuesday whether he would limit domestic travel, the president replied: “It’s possible.” The coronavirus task force also predicted Tuesday that the number of cases in the U.S. could peak in approximately 45-days. As of Tuesday morning, there were more than 4,660 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States, in 49 states, including Washington, D.C.

"                          With growing fears of the coronavirus pandemic, states have begun to respond by postponing their primary elections. Here are the states that have begun to take these initial steps. The spreading coronavirus outbreak has shut down more and more of American life — including schools, sporting events, bars, and now even elections. Multiple states have either announced they are postponing their presidential primary elections due to concerns about the novel coronavirus or made clear they are considering it. This comes after top election officials in Arizona, Florida, Ohio and Illinois issued a statement Friday saying they would go on with their Tuesday, March 17 elections, writing, ""Americans have participated in elections during challenging times in the past ... we are confident that voters in our states can safely and securely cast their ballots in this election."" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine backtracked Monday, announcing that his state health director will close down polls ""as a health emergency."" And Sunday night, in an interview after the CNN presidential debate that was held in a closed-off studio rather than in a hall with a live audience, presidential candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders hinted that it could be worth moving primary elections to protect against the coronavirus. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW TRAVELING DURING THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK: WHAT TO PACK ""I would hope that governors listen to the public health experts and what they are saying is … we don’t want gatherings of more than 50 people,” Sanders said. “I’m thinking about some of the elderly people sitting behind the desks, registering people and doing all that stuff. Does that make sense? I’m not sure it does."" Here are the states that are putting off their presidential primary elections: Louisiana Louisiana became the first state to postpone a primary or caucus on Friday, with Gov. John Bel Edwards signing an executive order to move the April 4 election to late June. ""Today I have certified that a state of emergency exists and requested that the governor issue an executive order postponing the elections this spring. We have requested postponing the April 4 primary election until June 20 and postponing the May 9 general election until July 25,"" Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin said. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES UNDER SIEGE AMID CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE: REPORT Christina Stephens, a spokeswoman for Edwards, said the move was to prevent further person-to-person transmission of the virus in Louisiana.

Ohio Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine asked a judge Monday to allow his state to postpone its election, originally scheduled for Tuesday, March 17, to June 2. ""We cannot conduct this election tomorrow,” he stressed in an announcement on Monday. After the judge ruled that the election would have to go forward, DeWine announced that he would prevent polls from opening anyway, with his state health director closing down polls ""as a health emergency."" DEMOCRACY 2020 DIGEST: OHIO TO ORDER POLLS CLOSED OVER CORONAVIRUS 'EMERGENCY,' GOVERNOR SAYS DeWine said that the state's in-person voting would not conform with CDC guidelines for preventing the spread of the coronavirus, and vowed to find a way to hold a ""free and fair"" election without putting voters' health at risk. ""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,"" DeWine said in a statement. ""As such, Health Director Dr. Amy Acton will order the polls closed as a health emergency. While the polls will be closed tomorrow, Secretary of State Frank LaRose will seek a remedy through the courts to extend voting options so that every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity."" The Ohio Supreme Court, in a ruling without an opinion Tuesday morning, denied a last-second effort to force the state to move ahead with the Tuesday elections, giving further legitimacy to DeWine's 11th-hour maneuver. Officials in the other three states slated to have elections Tuesday -- Arizona, Florida and Illinois -- confirmed Monday that they would still go through with their plans. Kentucky On recommendation from Kentucky Secretary of State Michael G. Adams, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear pushed back that state's primary from May 19 to June 23. ""I never would have imagined sitting here discussing this with you, but these are unprecedented times,"" Adams said in a video posted to Twitter. ""And we Kentuckians are having to change the way we do things on all fronts. Kentucky law allows the secretary of state and the governor to jointly act to change the time of an election due to a state of emergency."" He continued: ""Postponing the primary was not an easy decision, but the Republican secretary of state and Democratic governor agree, and so do county clerks of both parties, and they are our frontline election administrators. My hope is that this delay will allow us to have a normal election. Even if not, this delay will allow me, the state board of elections and our county clerks time to assess what changes we must make to ensure a successful primary election. There could be more changes, but this was a first step to buy is time and keep our citizens as safe as possible. We'll get through this."" Kentucky was originally slated to have one of the latest primaries of any state, with only five states and Washington, D.C., voting after it. This move by Kentucky throws into question almost the entire 2020 primary calendar, especially after President Trump's comments Monday that the coronavirus pandemic could last until July or August in the United States.

"                          President Trump announces the expansion of Medicare Telehealth Services and states HIPAA penalties will not be enforced Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday that the Trump administration wants to send checks to Americans “in the next two weeks” in an effort to help people cope with the economic fallout due to the coronavirus pandemic. “We’re looking at sending checks to Americans immediately,” Mnuchin said during a press briefing from the White House. “Americans need cash now, the president wants to get cash now. I mean now—in the next few weeks.” WHITE HOUSE EYES MASSIVE $850B STIMULUS PACKAGE NEXT, AS SENATE MOVES ON LATEST CORONAVIRUS BILL As the White House held its press conference Tuesday -- with President Trump, Vice President Pence, Mnuchin and the coronavirus task force present -- the Dow rallied nearly 1,000 points, after sustaining historic losses on Monday. “The president has instructed me we have to do this now,” Mnuchin added, though did not give specifics, except to say that the amount would be significant and that millionaires would not receive it. Fox News has learned, however, that Mnuchin is pressing GOP senators for a package that would send $200 billion-plus of payments to Americans by early April. Mnuchin’s comments came as the White House is in negotiations with lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Congress to approve a sweeping economic stimulus package to help U.S. businesses and taxpayers deal with the economic fallout from the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus. CLICK FOR THE CORONAVIRUS GUIDELINES RELEASED BY THE WHITE HOUSE Mnuchin, on Tuesday, also announced that the Treasury Department would not extend the deadline to file taxes by the April 15 deadline, as much of the tax filing can be done online. “We encourage Americans who can file taxes to continue to file taxes on April 15 because for many Americans, you will get tax refunds and we don’t want you to lose out on those tax refunds,” Mnuchin said. Mnuchin added that if individuals or corporations owe money to the Internal Revenue Service after filing their taxes, those payments now are able to be deferred for up to 90 days interest-free. “If you owe a payment to the IRS, you can defer up to $1 million as an individual, and $10 million to corporations, interest-free and penalty-free for 90 days,” Mnuchin continued. “File your taxes, you’ll automatically not get charged interests or penalties.” Mnuchin was planning to outline a nearly $850 billion package during a lunch with Senate Republicans Tuesday, which Trump administration officials hope to have approved by the end of this week. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, opening the Senate on Tuesday morning, promised swift action. ""The Senate will not adjourn until we have passed significant and bold new steps above and beyond what the House has passed to help our strong nation and our strong underlying economy weather this storm,"" McConnell said. The Trump administration’s stimulus package is bigger than the 2008 bank bailout, and the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which was passed and signed under former President Barack Obama, and totaled $787 billion to help stabilize the economy about 14 months after the last recession began. Trump, during the press briefing Tuesday, said there was “great spirit” among lawmakers with regard to the plan. “I can say that for Republicans and Democrats.” Meanwhile, the president and the coronavirus task force, which is led by Vice President Pence, touted the administration’s progress on testing for COVID-19, and announced that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has announced new policies to increase testing. “We have tremendous testing capacity,” Trump said. Pence said that testing is now available in all 50 states, and announced that “state health authorities can now authorize labs in their state and expand existing testing capabilities.” Pence also said the administration has continued to expand its “public-private partnership” with “vast commercial labs around the country,” which he said is “increasing access to coronavirus testing.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “This is greatly expanding access, even as we speak,” Pence said Tuesday. “It is important that the American people understand that testing is happening all around the country,” Pence said, adding that experts “want me to tell the American people that you don’t need the testing to know what you should do.” “Experts say that if every American acts on the coronavirus guidelines, we can see a substantial reduction in the spread, but as the president said, it will take all of us to do it,” Pence said, noting those guidelines rolled out by the White House and CDC Monday which included social distancing, limiting social gatherings to groups of less than 10 individuals, and staying at home. “For the American people, as a whole, the risk of serious illness remains low,” Pence said. The president weighed in on the guidelines, adding that he “would recommend that people enjoy their living rooms,” and urged young people to do their part. One guideline, specifically, states that: “If you are an older person, stay home and away from other people.” Another states: “If you are a person with a serious underlying health condition that can put you at increased risk (for example, a condition that impairs your lungs or heart function or weakens your immune system), stay home and away from other people.” “We have to fight that invisible enemy, I guess unknown, but we’re getting to know it much better,” Trump said of the virus. “We are looking to save a maximum number of lives.” The president also announced that he has been having open conversations with governors across the nation, leaders in the fast-food, pharmaceutical and grocery industries; and will meet with leaders of the tourism industry on Tuesday. The president was also asked about his tweets, referring to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese Virus,"" and whether he thought his rhetoric could create a stigma. Trump denied that notion, calling it a ""very accurate phrase,"" and said it was his response to China spreading disinformation about the U.S. military spreading COVID-19. ""Rather than having an argument, I said, I have to call it where it came from,"" Trump said. ""It did come from China."" The outbreak is believed to have originated at an animal and seafood market in the city of Wuhan, China. “We’re taking aggressive action now as one nation and one family so that America can rebound stronger frankly, stronger than ever,” he said. The World Health Organization designated COVID-19 a global pandemic last week. Trump announced a national emergency on Friday. The president also announced a temporary halt on air travel to the United States from Europe, now including flights from the United Kingdom, but excluding those carrying cargo. When asked Tuesday whether he would limit domestic travel, the president replied: “It’s possible.” The coronavirus task force also predicted Tuesday that the number of cases in the U.S. could peak in approximately 45-days. As of Tuesday morning, there were more than 4,660 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States, in 49 states, including Washington, D.C. The U.S., so far, has seen 85 coronavirus-related deaths.

"                          Mike Tobin reports from Chicago on why the state decided not to postpone voting. With the coronavirus outbreak spreading across the nation, Tuesday’s presidential primaries in Arizona, Florida and Illinois may well be the last ones held for the next couple months. Ohio’s primary was also scheduled to be held Tuesday – but state officials used emergency powers to postpone the contest hours before the polls were set to open. Primaries scheduled for next Tuesday in Georgia, April 4 in Louisiana, and May 19 in Kentucky already have been pushed back to later dates.  Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan also announced on Tuesday that his state's April 28 primary is being postponed until June 2. Democratic Party officials in Puerto Rico – which would hold its contest on March 29 – are seeking a delay as well.  PRIMARIES BEING HELD IN THREE BID STATES DESPITE CORONAVIRUS More delays are likely to follow for states scheduled to hold contests in the coming weeks. In Alaska, which is scheduled to hold its primary on April 4, the state Democratic Party urged voters to cast ballots by mail, tweeting: “If you were a registered Democrat by February 18, you should have your presidential primary ballot in the mail! Don't forget to follow the instructions, and mail it back postmarked by March 24!” These abrupt moves come with the country facing an unprecedented crisis as the coronavirus pandemic has caused millions of Americans to self-isolate in their homes in hopes of stemming the spread of the outbreak. After the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) urged against any gatherings of 50 people or more, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine stressed on Monday that “we cannot conduct this election tomorrow.” THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC Down the road – but also very much up in the air – are the biggest political gatherings of the year: the Democratic and Republican presidential nominating conventions. These two marquee political events are massive operations that take years of planning and have huge economic impacts on their host cities. But just like everything else in this world turned upside down by the virus that causes COVID-19, they may be in jeopardy. “The plan is to still move forward but this is obviously a fluid situation and we have to be prepared for everything,” a Democratic official with knowledge of planning for the Democratic National Convention told Fox News. “We’re going to stay in contact with relevant officials on the local, state, and federal level.” The convention is scheduled to be held July 13-16 in Milwaukee, Wis. Asked if there are conversations underway about pushing back the date of the convention or holding a more limited event, the official said: “We will have plans in place to do something differently if need be, but the plan right now is to move on as scheduled.” The GOP has a bit more breathing room. The Republican National Convention is scheduled to be held Aug. 24-27 in Charlotte, N.C. “As we move forward with planning, we remain in communication with local, state and federal officials and we will continue to closely monitor the situation and work with all stakeholders and health authorities to ensure every necessary precaution is taken into account,” 2020 Republican National Convention communications Blair Ellis told Fox News.  She said that “we prioritize the health and safety of delegates, media, guests, community members and staff.”       A polling location in Chicago, Illinois on primary day - March 17, 2020       But there’s a more immediate concern than the national conventions. Officials have already postponed some state party conventions, where the delegate process initiated during the primaries and caucuses continues and delegates who will represent their states at the national conventions are chosen. DNC Chairman Tom Perez sent state party chairs an email last week saying that the national party’s delegate selection team has been in contact with states that need to make changes to their delegate selection process due to the pandemic to ensure the nominating process will “continue without major interruptions.” Longtime Democratic National Committee member Kathy Sullivan – a veteran of the Rules Committee – noted that some states will need a waiver to change their approved delegate-selection plan. But she said “that’s not going to be a big deal. Everybody understands this is an unusual situation. … I think with the technology nowadays, these sorts of things can be handled.” A Democratic Party official acknowledged that “we are in uncharted waters right now” but emphasized, “what we have to do is stay in contact with everyone and be flexible, given the situation.” The potential freezing of the primary calendar comes as former Vice President Joe Biden – thanks to sweeping victories the past two-and-a-half weeks – has cemented his position as the unrivaled front-runner and has taken a commanding lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the all-important race for convention delegates. At the same time, Biden’s seen a tidal wave of support and endorsements from current and former members of Congress, governors and state lawmakers and party rainmakers – as centrists, moderates, and the party establishment have all coalesced around the former vice president in hopes that they’ve found the contender who can take out President Trump in November’s general election. Heading into Tuesday’s contests, Biden held a 153 pledged delegate lead over Sanders. And while he’s expected to pad that lead in Arizona, Florida, and Illinois – where public opinion polls indicated he held large leads over Sanders – the former vice president will still be far short of the 1,991 pledged delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination. That’s raised questions and concerns that Sanders – even if he suffers three more defeats on Tuesday – may stay in a contest that is being frozen in place by the global outbreak of the virus. On the eve of this week’s contests, Sanders in an email to supporters stressed that “this primary is far from over.”    ",         Coronavirus threatens to upend remaining primaries,         2020-03-17T130624-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/coronavirus-threatens-to-upend-remaining-primaries-even-conventions,Fox
"                          Federal prosecutors accuse the Republican lawmaker and his wife of illegally spending more than $250,000 in campaign money on family vacations, school tuition, dental work and other personal things; Jonathan Hunt reports from Los Angeles. Former Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., was sentenced on Tuesday to 11 months in prison and three years of supervised probation after pleading guilty to a single corruption charge.  The sentencing marks the end of a long saga for the disgraced Republican, who abruptly pleaded guilty to misusing campaign funds last December after arguing for more than a year that the criminal charges brought against him and his wife were a “witch hunt” aimed at driving the six-term Republican from office in the Democrat-controlled state.  Hunter officially resigned from his post in Congress in January after submitting letters of resignation to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and California Gov. Gavin Newsom. US REP. HUNTER BLAMES 'DEMOCRAT PROSECUTORS' FOR HIS INDICTMENT ON CORRUPTION CHARGES Hunter’s wife, Margaret Hunter, also was charged in the case and in June accepted a plea deal that called for her to testify against her husband. The couple could have faced decades in prison before the plea deals. Federal prosecutors said the couple spent more than $250,000 in campaign money for golf outings, family vacations to Italy and Hawaii, tequila shots and airline tickets for their pet rabbit. Prosecutors also revealed Hunter spent some of the money on romantic relationships with lobbyists and congressional aides. Hunter originally resisted calls to resign, framing the charges as a political attack by prosecutors sympathetic to Democrat Hillary Clinton. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP After his wife agreed to a plea deal, Hunter said: “It’s obvious that the Department of Justice went after her to get to me for political reasons.” Hunter’s resignation sets up the prospect of a second special House election in California this year. Freshman Rep. Katie Hill, a rising Democratic star, resigned her Los Angeles-area seat in October after explicit photos of her were posted online. Hunter narrowly survived a challenge in 2018 from Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar, a political newcomer. The 30-year-old Campa-Najjar is running again and Republican contenders include former Rep. Darrell Issa and radio personality Carl DeMaio, a former San Diego city councilman. The Associated Press contributed to this report.     ",         Former GOP Rep.

Bernie] Sanders' last stand. … There are 67 pledged delegates at stake in Arizona's Democratic presidential primary. The results in Arizona will be an important indicator, as Sanders has typically fared better in western states… Florida is the biggest prize available on March 17, awarding 219 pledged delegates in all. A diverse swing state, a good performance in Florida will help Sanders or [Joe] Biden make the case that they are the most electable Democrat to face President Trump in November. …Illinois will dole out 155 pledged delegates on March 17. Sanders laid some groundwork in Illinois earlier in the primary, visiting the state for three days to Biden's one as of March 11. Ohio originally was scheduled to have its primaries on March 17 before Gov. Mike DeWine announced a lawsuit Monday to push back the date to June 2.”Ohio Gov. DeWine wins fight to postpone primary - Politico: “Polls will not open for Ohio's primary election Tuesday after a late-night decision from Gov. Mike DeWine's administration, effectively upheld by the state Supreme Court, to delay in-person voting until June in an effort to protect voters and poll workers from the coronavirus outbreak. … The election was in limbo for several hours Monday night after a judge in Columbus denied a last-minute attempt backed by the state to postpone the primary election. But DeWine responded with an order from the state's top health official, Amy Acton, closing physical polling places as the legal battle moved up to the Ohio Supreme Court. Early Tuesday morning, four judges on that court issued a unanimous, unsigned ruling declining to stop the state from shuttering polls. Three other judges on the court recused — two because they're currently running for reelection and the other because he is DeWine's son. The ruling effectively overturns the Monday ruling from Franklin County Judge Richard Frye that the primary had to continue as scheduled.”Maryland joins growing list of states postponing primaries - Politico: “Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced that he was postponing the state's primaries, originally scheduled for late April, to June 2 as the country grapples with the spread of the coronavirus. Maryland is now the fifth state to move its primaries, joining Louisiana, Georgia, Kentucky and Ohio, which saw its primary originally scheduled for today pushed until June after an eleventh-hour legal battle. … But Maryland will still hold one election on April 28, foreshadowing a potentially broad move toward mail voting that could pave the way for elections across the country to continue during the coronavirus crisis. Hogan said he believed the special election to fill the seat of the late Rep. Elijah Cummings, in Maryland's Baltimore-based 7th Congressional District, should forward on as a mail-in only election, the first federal election to be shifted to mail voting in response to coronavirus.”BEREXITPolitico: “Bernie Sanders’ path to the Democratic nomination is closing, but a quick exit is far from guaranteed — even if he gets wiped out Tuesday. From his debate posture to staffing moves to the ‘virtual rally’ he convened Monday evening, the Vermont senator is signaling that he may not be ready to concede. If Sanders remains in the race, it will be in part to keep his ‘political revolution’ alive. According to people familiar with his thinking, Sanders will not only consider what’s best for his campaign, but also the progressive movement. Many of Sanders’ aides and allies also expect him to press onward after Tuesday. They see a benefit in amassing as many delegates as possible in order to influence the party platform at the Democratic National Convention this summer — even if Sanders himself can’t win the nomination. … Notably, Sanders has staff in place for states that vote as late as April 28, according to a campaign adviser, including New York. Sanders’ aides have long thought that he would have a good shot in the Empire State, which is rich in delegates.”Biden’s female veep promise reignites female president hopes - WaPo: “Biden, 77, has described himself as a ‘bridge’ to the next generation of leaders, a comment widely interpreted as a signal that he’d serve just one term, meaning his running mate would be even more of a president-in-waiting than usual. … A person close to the Biden team who was not authorized to speak publicly, and so spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the campaign will soon announce a running mate vetting operation, but warned that the campaign is in the midst of growing quickly after its rocky start. Biden has told MSNBC that it’s ‘very important’ to pick someone who’s been tested via a presidential campaign, suggesting that the women who ran against him may have an edge. Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) have both endorsed Biden, and Klobuchar in particular has gone out of her way to show her loyalty.”THE RULEBOOK: AVIOD THE ABYSS“This is the melancholy situation to which we have been brought by those very maxims and councils which would now deter us from adopting the proposed Constitution; and which, not content with having conducted us to the brink of a precipice, seem resolved to plunge us into the abyss that awaits us below.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 15TIME OUT: CÓISIR COSÚIL LEIS NA GAEILInsider: “It wasn't until the 1970s that pubs in Ireland opened on St. Patrick's Day, and in the 1990s, Dublin started hosting what's now Ireland's largest St. Patrick's Day festival… Leading up to the holiday, shamrocks can be found blooming at street markets across the country. … It's customary to wear a real shamrock leaf pinned to a shirt. … A pint of Guinness is perhaps an obvious St. Patrick's tradition, but bacon and cabbage is another traditional Irish meal. … Some locals or visitors may skip the crowds of the parade and head to St. Patrick's Island, one of the Skerries Islands off the coast of Dublin.

Fox News has learned that the White House specifically is pushing an $850 billion stimulus, largely in the form of tax relief measures. Roughly $500 billion of this would be tied to a payroll tax cut, while $250 billion would come in the form of Small Business Administration loans and another $58 billion would be directed to the airline industry, among other measures. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will attend the Senate GOP's weekly policy lunch Tuesday -- which will take place in a larger room that it usually does so the senators can practice social distancing -- to discuss the details of the comprehensive coronavirus proposal from the White House.”House stands pat, puts pressure on Senate - Roll Call: “The House is indefinitely extending its current district work period, with Democratic leaders telling their members Monday that they may not call them back to Washington until a third legislative package responding to the coronavirus pandemic is ready for a vote. House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer and Speaker Nancy Pelosi provided the schedule update on a Monday afternoon conference call with the Democratic Caucus, according to a source on the call who was not authorized to speak publicly. While Hoyer mentioned waiting until a third bill is ready, the Maryland Democrat did not rule out calling the House back sooner for other reasons, a Hoyer aide said.”Fed shares emergency lending program - NYT: “The Federal Reserve on Tuesday took another step to try and prop up the American economy, saying it would begin buying up a type of short-term debt companies use for funding, known as commercial paper, to help keep credit flowing to households and businesses. The program, enacted using the Fed’s emergency lending powers, pulls a page from the central bank’s 2008 financial crisis playbook and is an attempt to keep the economy and financial system functioning by backstopping a market that some of America’s biggest companies use to raise cash. Banks and companies have been issuing commercial paper to shore up their coffers as coronavirus leads to quarantines, shutters shopping centers and closes restaurants. But hardly anybody has been buying the debt. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, whose department will provide $10 billion of credit protection to the Fed using the Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund, said the facility would allow the central bank to buy up to $1 trillion worth of commercial paper ‘as needed.’”Poll finds Americans have little trust in coronavirus info from Trump - NPR: “Americans have little trust in the information they are hearing from President Trump about the novel coronavirus, and their confidence in the federal government's response to it is declining sharply, according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. Just 46% of Americans now say the federal government is doing enough to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, down from 61% in February. Just 37% of Americans now say they had a good amount or a great deal of trust in what they're hearing from the president, while 60% say they had not very much or no trust at all in what he's saying. The president rates worst of all groups tested, be it public health officials, state and local leaders or the news media. And more Americans disapprove of the president's handling of the pandemic than approve by a 49%-44% margin. But that does not differ greatly from his overall job approval rating, which stands at 43%.”Drucker: Republicans are less concerned about coronavirus than Dems - WashEx: “Republican voters are less concerned about the coronavirus pandemic, offering President Trump some measure of political cover as the November elections approach amid an accelerating public health crisis that is pushing the economy toward recession. Approximately 40% of self-identified Republicans fear that an acquaintance or family member might contract COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, compared to a whopping two-thirds of Democratic voters, according to public opinion polls conducted this month. This lopsided partisan split, which holds across several issues related to the pandemic, could help Trump weather the political fallout as nearly every aspect of American society grind to a screeching halt.”PLAY-BY-PLAYFormer Rep.

"                          The coronavirus is causing major adjustments to the Democratic presidential contest as debates have been cancelled and former Vice President Joe Biden attacks President Trump over his handling of the COVID-19 situation; Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy reports. Joe Biden is 77 years old. President Trump is 73 years old. Bernie Sanders is 78 years old and had a heart attack last year. They are just the kind of Americans that the CDC would consider most at risk amid the coronavirus outbreak. They're also running for president -- or in the case of Trump, re-election. TRUMP WANTS TO SEND AMERICANS CHECKS 'IMMEDIATELY' IN RESPONSE TO CORONAVIRUS, MNUCHIN SAYS So as the pandemic has forced the entire country to change its daily habits, so too has it compelled 2020's septuagenarian presidential field to take precautions. In the Democratic primary race, Biden and Sanders have transitioned essentially to a virtual campaign, for the good of their supporters, their staff and themselves. Florida, Illinois and Arizona are holding primaries Tuesday, but the rest of the primary calendar remains in limbo as other states postpone. In the meantime, the rapidly spreading coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, has grounded both the former vice president and Vermont senator, leading them to cancel campaign events and shift to relying on virtual rallies and town halls and press briefings from home. The two candidates -- and especially Trump -- are still probably doing more than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the White House would recommend. The administration on Monday released new guidelines for Americans to curb the spread of COVID-19; one guideline specifically states: “If you are an older person, stay home and away from other people.” Another states: “If you are a person with a serious underlying health condition that can put you at increased risk (for example, a condition that impairs your lungs or heart function or weakens your immune system), stay home and away from other people.” During Sunday’s primary debate, Sanders was asked about his heart attack in October, and how he planned to stay safe during the outbreak. “We had a fireside chat, not a rally,” Sanders said during the debate. “I love doing rallies and we bring many thousands of people out to our rallies. I enjoy it very much. We’re not doing that right now.” Sanders also said that he did not shake hands with the former vice president at the beginning of the debate and that he is “very careful about the people I am interacting with.” Biden, in a veiled swipe at Sanders, said later, “fortunately, I don’t have any of the underlying conditions you’re talking about,” adding that he is in “good health.” Trump, who tested negative for coronavirus over the weekend, has still been holding in-person meetings with the coronavirus task force, executives from pharmaceutical and health care industries, and more. The president held a briefing with reporters in the James S. Brady press briefing room at the White House Tuesday and said he was slated to meet with leaders of the tourism industry later in the day. Meanwhile, the Biden campaign said the former vice president would spend Tuesday’s primary day in Delaware. It is unclear, at this point, if he will hold any public events. Biden conducted a tele-town hall on Monday into Illinois, Arizona and Florida. The Sanders campaign said Tuesday they are “not doing traditional GOTV outreach in states holding primary contests today. “We are making clear to voters that we believe going to the polls amid the coronavirus outbreak is a personal decision and we respect whichever choice they make,” Mike Casca, Bernie 2020 communications director, said in a statement. “We are also passing along guidance from the CDC on staying safe during the crisis.” SANDERS ATTACKS BIDEN RECORD AS ONE-ON-ONE DEBATE TURNS PERSONAL Sanders also previously had suggested that the primaries on Tuesday should be postponed for safety reasons amid the coronavirus outbreak. In a post-debate interview on CNN, Sanders, I-Vt., pointed to the guidelines released by the CDC limiting gatherings for the next eight weeks as the country grapples with the highly contagious COVID-19. “I would hope that governors listen to the public health experts and what they are saying is…we don’t want gatherings of more than 50 people,” Sanders said when asked about Tuesday’s contests. “I’m thinking about some of the elderly people sitting behind the desks, registering people and doing all that stuff. Does that make sense? I’m not sure it does.” Ohio later postponed its Tuesday primary, but the other states pressed ahead. As of Tuesday afternoon, there were more than 5,600 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in the United States, with 94 coronavirus-related deaths.

"                          Reaction from Peter Morici, business professor at the University of Maryland and former chief economist for the U.S. International Trade Commission. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that the coronavirus pandemic is ""worse than 9/11"" for the airline industry as he discussed the Trump administration's economic relief plans at a White House coronavirus briefing Tuesday. ""I think, as you know, this is worse than 9/11. For the airline industry, this is, they are almost ground to a halt,"" Mnuchin said to reporters. Mnuchin, after the briefing, was slated to head over to Capitol Hill to pitch the Trump administration's $850 billion stimulus package to Republican senators at their weekly policy lunch. That package includes $58 billion for the airline industry, along with a roughly $500 billion payroll tax cut and $250 billion in Small Business Administration loans. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW WHITE HOUSE EYES MASSIVE $850B STIMULUS PACKAGE NEXT, AS SENATE MOVES ON LATEST CORONAVIRUS BILL ""The airline industry will be in good shape,"" Trump added as reporters pushed Mnuchin on specifics in the administration's proposal. Discussing the Trump administration's stimulus package more broadly, Mnuchin said that he planned to shepherd the president's plan along in Congress much as he served as the point person negotiating a smaller coronavirus package with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that passed the House of Representatives early Saturday morning. ""We look forward to having bipartisan support -- we're now working with the Senate -- to pass this legislation very quickly. And these will be payments to small businesses,"" Mnuchin said. ""We've talked about loan guarantees to critical industries such as airlines and hotels, and we've also talked about a stimulus package to the American worker. You can think of this as something like business interruption payments for the American workers."" Mnuchin also discussed other measures the Trump administration is taking to reduce the economic sting out of the quasi-shutdown of the American economy as local, state and federal governments work to contain the spread of the virus that was declared a pandemic last week by the World Health Organization. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The treasury secretary said Trump favors a payroll tax holiday but that the administration is looking at sending checks to Americans  ""immediately"" to help cover coronavirus-related expenses. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, have each made similar proposals in Congress in recent days. Mnuchin, in an interview with Chris Wallace on ""Fox News Sunday,"" pitched ""a big stimulus program because we need to help American workers now."" But he made clear that he and the president are not asking for a bailout. ""If you're providing liquidity to good businesses that just need liquidity for 3 to 6 months,"" he said, ""that's not a bailout.""

"                          Fox News Decision Desk projects that former Vice President Joe Biden will decisively beat Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders in the delegate-rich states of Florida and Illinois. Joe Biden swept another round of delegate-rich contests Tuesday – winning in Florida, Illinois and Arizona – further cementing the former vice president as the dominant front-runner in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination over Bernie Sanders as the coronavirus threat scrambles the primary calendar for the foreseeable future. Florida and Illinois will award a hefty 219 and 155 pledged delegates, respectively, while Arizona is worth 67 delegates. Together, the contests are likely to only add to the pressure on Sanders to reconsider his presence in the race. CLICK FOR LIVE RESULTS Last week, Sanders vowed to press on after a string of defeats, signaling he wants to continue to pressure Biden to embrace more progressive policies.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke)       ""Our campaign has had a very good night,"" Biden told supporters in Wilmington, Delaware, before the Arizona race was called. ""We've moved closer to securing the Democratic Party's nomination for president. And we're doing it by building a broad coalition that we need to win in November, with strong support from the African-American community, the Latino community, high school-aged people, educated people ... labor, teachers, suburban women, veterans, firefighters and so many more."" Once again, he extended an olive branch to Sanders in a nudge to convince him to step aside, though as recently as their debate on Sunday, Sanders showed little inclination to accept. ""Senator Sanders and I may disagree on tactics, but we share a common vision for the need to provide affordable health care for all Americans, reducing income inequality hat has risen so drastically, to tackling the existential threat of our time, climate change,"" he said. ""Senator Sanders and his supporters have brought a remarkable passion and tenacity to all of these issues. ... Together, they have shifted the fundamental conversation in this country. So let me say, especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Senator Sanders. I hear you."" SANDERS REVEALS HOW HE'LL PAY FOR PROGRAMS -- ARE THERE ISSUES? Earlier in the evening, Sanders gave an online address as well focused on the pandemic, providing a detailed list of proposals to address the medical and economic issues caused by the novel coronavirus. Sanders said his proposals would cost ""at least $2 trillion"" and would include monthly $2,000 checks to American households.

(AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast)       In Florida, a key swing state in the general election, Sanders was walloped. Biden was ahead in the state by a massive margin of 61.5 percent to 22.7 percent, with 82 percent of precincts reporting. The rout was somewhat expected, with the state's sizable Cuban- and Venezuelan-American population largely resistant to Sanders' democratic socialist politics and many voters angered after he defended former Cuban dictator Fidel Castro's literacy programs. Twenty percent of Democratic primary voters in the Florida primary were Hispanic -– a group that typically has been a strength for Sanders. Six-in-ten voted for Biden, who received approximately two-thirds of the vote among Puerto Ricans and almost six-in-ten among Cubans, according to the Fox News Voter Analysis. FOX NEWS VOTER ANALYSIS: FULL METHODOLOGY Despite ongoing concerns about the coronavirus, seniors made up more than one-third of the electorate in Florida – the highest portion in any primary surveyed this year, the Fox News Voter Analysis showed. Biden easily won voters over the age of 65, with almost eight-in-ten supporting him. Electability continued to play a factor in Biden's favor.

Huh)       Across all states voting on Tuesday, voters said they believed Biden was better positioned to win in November. Roughly 83 percent of voters in Arizona, Florida, and Illinois felt Biden could beat President Trump, while only about 62 percent of voters in those states had the same confidence in Sanders, according to Fox News Voter Analysis. Meanwhile, Trump easily clinched the Republican presidential nomination with wins in the Illinois and Florida Republican primaries, officially dashing the hopes of any of the extreme long-shot candidates who challenged him in that primary. A total of 441 delegates was at stake in the Democratic primary on Tuesday, and the big question was whether the coronavirus would affect turnout at the polls. Some early indications were that turnout in Florida actually may have been higher than 2016 figures. DNC CHAIR URGES VOTERS TO CAST BALLOTS BY MAIL Biden is moving closer to securing the Democratic presidential nomination but had faced the possibility of a setback if the older voters who tend to support him didn't show up. Sanders, meanwhile, couldn't afford to lose support from young voters who have been his most loyal supporters. In the end, Biden did not appear to suffer any measurable loss of support. Problems related to the virus scare still reportedly popped up across the country, including in Florida, the biggest delegate prize of the evening. In Okaloosa County on the Panhandle, two dozen poll workers dropped out, leaving supervisors scrambling to find replacements. Millions of voters have already participated in some form of early voting. But there were some signs on Tuesday that voters — and poll workers — were staying home.

Only 17 people had voted, a pace that officials said was unusually slow. In Palm Beach County, Florida, 800 volunteer poll workers backed out on Monday and just 100 new volunteers offered to take their place. In Illinois, there was a push to relocate about 50 Chicago-area polling places after locations canceled at the last minute and said they would not be available for use on Tuesday.

Leaders in Ohio called off their primary just hours before polls were set to open as the federal government urged Americans not to gather in groups of 10 or more and asked older people to stay home. The state's Democratic Party said it was weighing options for challenging that move, which was pushed by the Republican governor. Georgia has delayed its primary from March 24 to May 19, and Louisiana from April 4 to June 20. Additionally, Maryland has moved its April 28 primary to June 2, and Kentucky has pushed its primary from May 19 to June 23. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) has reportedly warned that states that delay their primaries past June 9 could face a hefty delegate penalty -- angering some commentators who call the ultimatum reckless given the threat posed by coronavirus. “The right to vote is the foundation of our democracy, and we must do everything we can to protect and expand that right instead of bringing our democratic process to a halt,” DNC chairman Tom Perez said in a statement. He is urging states to expand options like voting by mail in upcoming contests.

The coronavirus outbreak and its impact on the primary calendar could only amplify calls for Sanders to drop out of the race. About half of the delegates in the Democratic primary have already been awarded and, with Biden looking at another big night Tuesday, he will pad an already large and perhaps insurmountable lead. CORONAVIRUS THREATENS TO UPEND REMAINING PRIMARIES, CONVENTIONS Biden's quest for his party's nomination now seems within reach.

""Even though a decision has not yet been made by the city or by the state, I think New Yorkers should be prepared right now for the possibility of a shelter-in-place order,"" de Blasio, a Democrat, said in a press conference Friday.

Daniel Lipinski, D-Ill., a rare anti-abortion House Democrat, has lost his party’s primary race to challenger Marie Newman, a small business owner endorsed by far-left Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. Newman challenged Lipinski in 2018 and was edged out in a close primary race, but this time she managed to narrowly defeat the incumbent congressman, who has represented Illinois’ third district since 2005. JUSSIE SMOLLETT PROSECUTOR WINS PRIMARY “This is a Democratic district. Let’s have a Real Democrat fighting for us,” Newman tweeted Monday, including infographics showing how Lipinski’s past votes against Obamacare and for restricting access to women’s reproductive healthcare are at odds with her own support for universal healthcare and greater access to abortions. The win all but assures that Newman, 55, will take over the seat that Lipinski’s father held for nearly three decades before he retired after the 2004 primary and local Democrats chose his son to replace him on the general election ballot. Newman, a former management consultant who started and led an anti-bullying nonprofit, argued Lipinski no longer reflected the views of the district, which backed Sen. Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist, over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential primary. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., endorsed Newman back in September. She told the New York Times that Newman is ""a textbook example of one of the ways that we could be better as a party — to come from a deep blue seat and to be championing all the issues we need to be championing.""

"                          Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Cook County, Illinois State’s Attorney Kim Foxx prevailed in Tuesday’s Democratic primary, where she faced several challengers who had focused on the controversy surrounding her handling of the Jussie Smollett case. Foxx drew national attention over Smollett's case, which began with a hate crime investigation, turned into charges against Smollett for an alleged hoax, and ended with Foxx dismissing the case altogether, drawing the ire of local police. JUSSIE SMOLLETT'S BID TO GET CHARGES THROWN OUT REJECTED BY ILLINOIS SUPREME COURT “This win is about all of us. I’ve spent the last four years working to reform a system that is not representative of the communities it serves - I’m ready to continue this work,” Foxx said. The three Democrats who challenged Foxx made her handling of the Jussie Smollett case -- which is now before a special prosecutor-- central to the campaign. Foxx abruptly dropped charges last year against the “Empire” actor, who was accused of staging a racist, anti-gay attack. Questions loom about whether she acted improperly for speaking to a Smollett relative and aide to former first lady Michelle Obama before the charges were dismissed. Foxx had said that she had recused herself from the case due to those contacts, but her office continued to handle it instead of turning it over to a special prosecutor. A spokesperson later explained that Foxx only meant that she was recusing herself in the “colloquial” sense, and that she herself would not be involved. Text messages later revealed that Foxx still gave her opinion on the matter to a deputy – saying Smollett was overcharged -- in the weeks before Smollett’s charges were dropped. A special prosecutor reinstated the charges, which Foxx called political. Foxx fended off challenges from Bill Conway, Donna More, and Bob Fioretti, with Conway placing a distant second despite his family pouring millions into his campaign.

"                          The choices we make as individuals will collectively make a big difference to the pandemic, says Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Joe Biden solidified his hold on the Democratic nomination, adding to his delegate lead with big wins in Florida, Illinois and Arizona.  JOE BIDEN CRUISES TO A  TUESDAY SWEEP The primary – like so much else in American life – was deeply affected by the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. The campaigns stopped holding events, the debate between Biden and Sanders was moved from Arizona to Washington, D.C., and Ohio canceled its election less than 24 hours before polls opened.  Fox News Voter Analysis surveys in each state highlighted the extent to which the pandemic was on Democratic primary voters’ minds as they headed to the polls: at least three-quarters of voters in each state were at least somewhat concerned they or someone in their family might contract the virus. Concern about the virus was particularly pronounced among seniors in each state.  HERE'S HOW TO STOP THE CORONAVIRUS SPREAD Democratic primary voters have said health care is the top issue facing the country in each contest surveyed to date, and that trend continued Tuesday. Nearly half cited health care as the top issue in Arizona and Florida, rivaling the record high set last week in Missouri (47 percent). In the primaries through Super Tuesday, the number of voters prioritizing health care tended to be in the mid-thirties.  Despite the recent reversal in the stock market, fewer than two-in-ten voters in each state called the economy the top issue, placing it just ahead of climate change in Florida and Illinois and in third place (behind climate change) in Arizona. In each state, it was far below health care on voters’ list of priorities.  At least seven-in-ten voters in each state favored changing to a single-payer health care system, a policy Sanders has championed, but even these voters backed Biden by double-digit margins in Florida (+32 percentage points) and Illinois (+16 points). Sanders won them – but only narrowly – in Arizona (+5 points).  Roughly nine-in-ten voters in each state favored moving to a public option health care system. PRIMARY TRENDS While concern about coronavirus has upended much of the primary in the past several days, the main trends and themes of the race stayed constant.  Democratic primary voters remained split between preferring a candidate who would restore the political system to the way it worked before Trump and a candidate who promised fundamental change. Biden won six-in-ten “restore” voters in Arizona and roughly eight-in-ten in Florida and Illinois. Sanders won “change” voters by a wide margin in Arizona, by a narrower spread in Illinois, and lost them in Florida.  Moreover, Biden continued to rely on strong support among older voters, African Americans, and political moderates. He also won suburban and rural voters in each state.  In the run-up to this week’s contests, Biden embraced Elizabeth Warren’s bankruptcy protection plan and endorsed free public college tuition for most families. Both moves were seen as attempts to appeal to younger voters. He won more than one-third of 18 to 29-year-olds in Florida and more than one-quarter in Illinois – better marks than he achieved in previous contests (except for those in southern states with large African American populations).  Latino voters were another key focus for Biden’s campaign. He won this group handily in Florida and received more than one-third of the Hispanic vote in Arizona and Illinois. His previous high-water mark among Latinos was 36 percent in Virginia.  While Biden was able to somewhat expand his coalition, support for Sanders continued to run almost exclusively with the groups who have supported him all along: voters under age 30, Latinos, and self-described “very liberal” voters. His lack of support among seniors (14 percent or less in each state) and black voters (18 percent in Florida and 23 percent in Illinois) proved too much of a liability to overcome.  Biden’s broader coalition meant that more voters would be satisfied if he were the eventual Democratic nominee: between 76 percent (Arizona) and 84 percent (Florida) would be satisfied with Biden; between 63 percent (Florida) and 68 percent (Arizona and Illinois) would be satisfied with Sanders.  Roughly nine-in-ten Democratic primary voters in each state said they would definitely or probably support Biden if he were the nominee. Sanders enjoyed similar support in Arizona (90 percent), but trailed Biden’s mark slightly in Illinois and Florida.  Biden and Sanders voters were equally likely to say they would back the other candidate if he won the nomination. This marks a change from earlier in the primary process when Sanders supporters were somewhat less likely to say they would support the eventual nominee.  Overall, more Democrats in each state felt Biden had a better chance against Trump in the fall.  Roughly eight-in-ten voters in each state were confident that the leadership of the Democratic Party represented their values – though Sanders supporters were more likely to express some skepticism on that front.  Similarly, about seven-in-ten voters in each state had confidence that the nomination process was fair – but roughly half of Sanders backers felt the process was unfair. FLORIDA Florida had the most delegates up for grabs on Tuesday, and Biden won the state convincingly. Seniors made up more than one-third of the electorate, which provided him a major boost. Latinos were also a source of strength for Biden in Florida, an important change for him after he struggled to win their votes in other states. Hispanics under age 45 split between Biden (43 percent) and Sanders (44 percent), while the former vice president won by 57 points among Latinos over 45 – giving Biden a comfortable win with this group overall. Some of Sanders’ trouble in Florida may have been related to his praise for the accomplishments of Fidel Castro’s regime in Cuba. However, he did somewhat better with Cuban voters (losing 36-57 percent) than among Puerto Ricans (23-66 percent). Sanders also lost Hispanics from places besides Cuba and Puerto Rico (34-54 percent).  In a sign of Biden’s dominance, he and Sanders split the “very liberal” vote. Biden previously only won very liberal voters in Mississippi; beyond that, they were a core part of Sanders’ base. Despite being Jewish himself, Sanders was unable to earn significant support from Florida’s sizable Jewish population.  Florida will likely be a swing state in the November election. Democratic primary voters there thought Biden gave them the best chance against Trump. Twice as many thought Biden could definitely beat Trump (55 percent) than thought Sanders could (24 percent). ARIZONA Arizona was Sanders’ best state, thanks in large part to the fact that many ballots were cast before the race shifted dramatically in the run-up to Super Tuesday. Sanders won handily among long-time supporters (57-32 percent), while those who made up their minds in the last month broke heavily for Biden. Sanders won the Latino vote by an 8-point margin but was unable to win an outright majority among this key group. While Hispanic voters are a key source of strength for the Vermont senator, he has won less than 50 percent of the Latino vote in every state except California (exactly 50 percent).  Despite sharing a border with Mexico and the ongoing debate about President Trump’s proposed border wall, just 6 percent of Arizona Democratic primary voters cited immigration as the top issue facing the country. On immigration policy, almost twice as many opposed increasing security along the U.S.-Mexico border as favored it.  Hispanic primary voters opposed increasing border security by a narrower margin than (44 percent favor vs. 56 percent oppose) white voters (33 percent favor vs. 67 percent oppose).  When it comes to the general election, Arizona Democratic primary voters were more confident in Biden’s chances against Trump than Sanders’.  More results can be found here ILLINOIS   Despite the fact that a record-high 68 percent of Illinois Democratic primary voters would be satisfied if Sanders were the nominee, Biden won the state by a massive margin. The former vice president ran up huge numbers among voters over age 45, moderates, and African Americans – and was particularly dominant among women over age 65.  Religious voters of every major denomination went for Biden, and he won the Jewish vote by a 41-point margin. Non-religious voters split much more evenly. Even in the Land of Lincoln, Democratic primary voters split over paying reparations for slavery. Black voters overwhelmingly favored the idea, while six-in-ten white voters opposed it.

Surveys for the March 17 primary states were conducted in Arizona, Florida, and Illinois. The surveys were conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago the week before the primaries, concluding as polls closed. Interviews were conducted in English or Spanish. The surveys are based on interviews with a random sample of registered voters drawn from the state voter file. In Florida and Illinois, these probability sample results were supplemented by interviews with self-identified registered voters recruited from nonprobability online panels.  The sample sizes and margins of sampling error were 1,977 in Arizona (plus or minus 3.4 percentage points), 3,385 in Florida (plus or minus 3.0 percentage points), and 2,715 in Illinois (plus or minus 3.2 percentage points).

Though Majority Leader Mitch McConnell directed the Republican majority to pass the House coronavirus package despite its flaws, the Senate could not come to an agreement and will take up the bills on Wednesday, along with an amendment from Sen. Rand Paul, R.-Ky. The bill needed 60 votes to pass the upper chamber, and McConnell originally said the Senate would not take a recess until the bill was passed. ""We're going to move here in warp speed for the Senate, which almost never does anything quickly,"" McConnell said Tuesday. ""A number of my members think there were considerable shortcomings in the House bill. My counsel to them it is to gag and vote for it anyway,"" McConnell said Tuesday after lunching with his fellow Republicans. A senior GOP source told Fox News over the weekend not to “underestimate the challenge the Senate could face passing this bill.” Some GOP lawmakers worried that the paid leave portion of the bill would hurt small businesses. The House bill would cap paid leave at companies with 500 employees, and businesses with fewer than 50 employees could apply for a waiver. SANDERS CALLS FOR $2G A MONTH TO HOUSEHOLDS  The Senate remained in session all day with the measures without agreement after Paul objected to the measures. Now the Senate will try to approve the coronavirus packages sometime Wednesday, and to vote on the amendment by Paul. The House bill, which has the support of President Trump, would make coronavirus testing free, expand unemployment aid to states, offer 14 paid sick days and extend emergency leave for workers dealing with the coronavirus.

Former Vice President Joe Biden called for unity among Democrats and Americans in general Tuesday night, as the country grapples with the coronavirus pandemic -- and as he claimed big wins in the latest Democratic primaries. Biden addressed an online audience from his home in Wilmington, Del., noting the significance of strong leadership as well as action from individuals such as social distancing. SANDERS CALLS FOR $2G A MONTH FOR HOUSEHOLDS, ADMITS CORONAVIRUS PLAN WOULD COST AT LEAST $2 TRILLION “Yes, this is a moment where we need our leaders to lead,"" Biden said, ""but it's also a moment where the choices and decisions we make as individuals are going to collectively impact on what happens, make a big difference in the severity of this outbreak, and the ability of our medical and hospital systems to handle it."" The Democratic presidential hopeful expressed optimism in the American public's ability to overcome. ""That's who we are. Ordinary people doing extraordinary things when the need arises,"" he said. Biden then addressed Tuesday's primaries, where he decisively won in Florida and Illinois, with results from Arizona's primary still incoming as he spoke. A fourth scheduled primary, in Ohio, was abruptly postponed as a coronavirus-related precaution. As he has done in the past, Biden touted his ability to form coalitions, mentioning support he has received from black and Latino voters, as well as suburban women, laborers and teachers. Biden then addressed the portion of the Democratic electorate that he still needs to win over: Sen. Bernie Sanders' supporters. He appealed to them by claiming that while he and Sanders differ in their ""tactics,"" they ""share a common vision"" that includes affordable health care, decreasing income inequality, and climate change, which Biden referred to as ""the existential threat of our time."" The moderate Biden praised the ""remarkable passion and tenacity "" of Sanders and his supporters, and recognized that ""they have shifted the fundamental conversation in this country."" Specifically addressing younger voters who are inspired by Sanders, Biden had a clear message: ""I hear you, I know what’s at stake. I know what we have to do."" Biden concluded by stating that his goal is to unify the Democratic Party and the country as a whole, using the coronavirus outbreak as an example for what kind of unity is needed. ""It’s moments like these that we realize we have to put politics aside and work together as Americans. The coronavirus doesn’t care if you’re a Democrat or Republican. It will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender, or your zip code. It will touch people in positions of power as well as the most vulnerable people in our society,"" he said.

President Trump praised Andrew Cuomo for doing a “really great job” on the coronavirus Tuesday — just a day after slamming the governor on Twitter. The president told reporters at the White House he had a “great talk” with Cuomo Tuesday morning and that they are working together on COVID-19, including to set up new hospitals requested by Cuomo.

He added that a “hotspot” of virus transmission in New York is “not the fault of anybody.” New York now has the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the US. As of Tuesday morning, there were nearly 1,400. Washington state is second with fewer than 1,000 cases. The tone was a dramatic contrast from Monday’s social media sniping, with Trump writing “Cuomo of New York has to ‘do more’,” and the governor hitting back: “Happy to do your job, too.

Bloomberg Philanthropies, the ex-mayor’s charitable organization, said it will use the funds to slow the spread of COVID-19 in vulnerable low- and middle-income countries. It will fund rapid response teams to prevent and detect infection, train health care workers, develop lab networks to amplify testing capabilities, and measure containment strategies and the cancellation of mass gatherings.

"                          Reaction from Arizona GOP chairwoman Dr. Kelli Ward. President Trump has officially secured the 2020 Republican presidential nomination after victories in the Florida and Illinois primaries Tuesday, according to an Associated Press delegate count. Trump surpassed the 1,276 delegates needed to secure the nomination two months earlier than he did in 2016, when he battled a huge field of rivals as an insurgent candidate. BIDEN PROJECTED TO WIN FLORIDA AND ILLINOIS PRIMARIES, WITH POLLS SET TO CLOSE SOON IN ARIZONA ""Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump  - the presumptive 2020 Republican nominee for President!"" Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeted Tuesday evening. Trump's campaign says it shows the enthusiasm of Trump's voters and how unified Republicans are behind him as Democrats continue to wage a contested primary contest. This put an end to the longshot challenges that Trump faced, from candidates including former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh and former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford. None of the other candidates posed much of a threat, with only Weld winning any delegates. Weld won a single delegate at the Iowa caucuses.

"                          Mike Tobin reports from Chicago on why the state decided not to postpone voting. With Americans forced to self-isolate in their homes amid the coronavirus pandemic, turnout has been noticeably low in parts of Illinois, one of the three states holding presidential primaries on Tuesday. For comparison: Turnout in Chicago by early afternoon was less than half the level from the 2016 Democratic presidential primary, according to the city’s board of elections. CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC THREATENS TO UPEND REMAINING PRIMARIES, CONVENTIONS But election officials in Illinois, as well as in Arizona and Florida, the other two states holding primaries on Tuesday, were confident that a surge in early voting and mail-in ballots could make up for the drop in voting on primary day. In recent days, election officials in all three states relocated some polling stations that were originally set to be located in senior centers or nursing homes. Senior citizens are most at risk from the coronavirus, which is officially known as COVID-19. Concerns about the outbreak likely caused some poll workers in Florida and Illinois to stay home on Tuesday.  The relocating of polling sites in Florida led to some disruptions, and low turnout was reported in some counties while voting was going smoothly in other locations. There were no major issues reported by early afternoon in Arizona – where most voters had cast their ballots before primary day. Most polls in Florida were set to close at 7 p.m. ET, with the western part of the state’s panhandle – which is located in the central time zone -- closing at 8 p.m. ET. Polls in Illinois were set to close at 8 p.m. ET and polls in Arizona were scheduled to shut down at 10 p.m. ET. On primary eve, Ohio’s governor used an emergency order to postpone his state’s contest after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) urged against any gatherings nationwide of 50 people or more. “We cannot conduct this election tomorrow,” Gov. Mike DeWine stressed. Mailing it in In an effort to keep voters and poll workers safe amid the coronavirus pandemic and prevent the postponement of primaries, the Democratic National Committee is calling on states that have upcoming presidential primary contests to offer options like voting by mail. “States can provide easy access to voting while still taking necessary precautions to protect the health and safety of the American people. In order to ensure the voices of voters are heard, the DNC is urging the remaining primary states to use a variety of other critical mechanisms that will make voting easier and safer for voters and election officials alike,” DNC chair Tom Perez urged in a Tuesday statement. Team Biden confident Former Vice President Joe Biden’s campaign is touting the early voter turnout. “While voter turnout on Election Day itself may be lower due to COVID-19 concerns, we believe that, with early vote and vote by mail, overall turnout will be roughly on pace for 2016 in Arizona and Florida and roughly on pace for 2018 in Illinois, and that voter turnout in all three states will reflect the population at large,” Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield highlighted in a memo sent to reporters on Tuesday afternoon. The campaign spotlighted the high numbers of older voters – and voters of color – who were casting ballots in all three states. The former vice president enjoyed strong support from older voters and African Americans, while his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination – Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont – has struggled to resonate with such voters. PRIMARIES GO AHEAD IN THREE STATES AS BIDEN ATTEMPS TO SHUT OUT SANDERS Sanders – a progressive champion who’s making his second straight White House run -- was the front-runner in the race for much of February thanks to a partial victory in Iowa’s caucuses, an outright win in New Hampshire’s primary, and a shellacking of the rest of the Democratic field of contenders in Nevada’s caucuses. But over the last two and a half weeks, Sanders has watched Joe Biden zoom past him in the race for the presidential nomination. Following a landslide win in South Carolina’s primary and sweeping victories in the coast-to-coast Super Tuesday states as well as last week’s mini Super Tuesday, the former vice president cemented his position as the unrivaled front-runner and has taken a commanding lead over Sanders in the all-important race for convention delegates. The Biden campaign – in its memo – said, “We expect to emerge tonight with a bigger delegate lead than we had going into the night.” And they argued, “It would take a drastic, historically-incomparable swing for Senator Sanders to win more delegates than Biden today or to close the delegate differential.” 'This primary is far from over' Pre-primary public opinion polls indicated Biden enjoying large leads in all three states. And if Tuesday’s contests deliver another round of decisive victories by the former vice president, the chorus of calls for Sanders to step aside will grow louder. But Biden will still be short of the 1,991 pledged delegates needed to clinch the nomination. And with the primary calendar likely grinding to a halt after Tuesday's contests due to the coronavirus pandemic, there’s the possibility that Sanders could stay alive in a race that will be frozen in time. On Monday, Sanders didn’t sound like a candidate ready to call it quits. “This primary is far from over,” Sanders stressed in an email to supporters on the eve of Tuesday’s contests. And on Tuesday, the Sanders campaign spotlighted that three virtual campaign events they held the past three days “amassed 5.3 million views in total.”“Our digital organizing infrastructure is unmatched,” Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir emphasized. And the Sanders campaign was also spotlighting on Tuesday its hands-off approach to trying to get their supporters to the polls – and emphasizing that health concerns take precedent. “We are not doing traditional GOTV outreach in states holding primary contests today. We are making clear to voters that we believe going to the polls amid the coronavirus outbreak is a personal decision and we respect whichever choice they make. We are also passing along guidance from the CDC on staying safe during the crisis,” Sanders communications director Mike Casca said in a statement.

"                          The choices we make as individuals will collectively make a big difference to the pandemic, says Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. A landslide in Florida.  A blow out in Illinois. And a victory as well in Arizona – giving former Vice President Joe Biden a clean sweep on Tuesday and effectively shutting the door to any possible pathway for rival Sen. Bernie Sanders to win the Democratic presidential nomination. The convincing victories came as the primary calendar is likely to grind to a halt due to the coronavirus pandemic, freezing the Democratic presidential nomination race in place. BIDEN CRUSHES SANDERS IN PRIMARY SWEEP ON TUESDAY NIGHT Sanders - the populist senator from Vermont who’s making his second straight White House bid  - now faces the toughest decision of his political career as he struggles with deciding when to bring an end to his presidential campaign but ensure that his political revolution continues the fight. Biden speaking from his home in Wilmington, Del., declared that “our campaign has had a very good night.” “We moved closer to securing the Democratic Party’s nomination for president.  And we’re doing it by building a broad coalition that we need to win in November,” the former vice president emphasized. Biden crushed Sanders in Florida by nearly 40 percentage points.  With 215 delegates up for grabs, Florida was the biggest prize in Tuesday’s contests. But it’s also the biggest of the battleground or swing states that will determine whether President Trump or the Democratic nominee will win November’s general election. CLICK HERE FOR LATEST RESULTS  A Fox News voter analysis shows that Biden cleaned up among Hispanic voters – who made up a fifth of the state’s primary electorate – as well as with voters over the age of 65 – who made up a third of all primary voters. Biden also shellacked Sanders in Illinois – where 155 delegates were at stake. A strong showing with African Americans and white working-class voters boosted Biden. And in all three states voters said Biden was better positioned than Sanders to defeat the president in November’s general election, according to the Fox News Voter analysis. The victories significantly boosted Biden’s already wide lead over Sanders in the crucial race for convention delegates. THE FOX NEWS DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION DELEGATE TRACKER “It is hard to see a mathematical path for Bernie Sanders to win the nomination. Joe Biden is the presumptive nominee.  Biden is building and winning the large, diverse population that Sanders said he would win,” said Mo Elleithee, the founding executive director of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service and a Fox News contributor. Elleithee, a senior spokesman for Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign who later served as communications director for the Democratic National Committee, stressed that “Sanders still has a chance to impact the debate and the party platform. But Joe Biden is the candidate who will face President Trump in November.” For a second straight week, Biden extended an olive branch to Sanders and his legions of young supporters.  “Sen. Sanders and I may disagree on tactics but we share a common vision for the need to provide affordable health care for all Americans… to tackling the existential threat of our time – climate change,” Biden said. “Sen. Sanders and his supporters have brought a remarkable passion and tenacity to all of these issues. Together they’ve shifted the fundamental conversation in this country.” In an attempt to unify the party as he tries to boot Trump from the White House in November’s election, Biden said “let me say especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Sen. Sanders – I near you. I know what’s at stake. I know what we have to do. Our goal as a campaign and my goal as a candidate for president is to unify this party, and then to unify the nation.” After losing five of the six states that held contests last week,  Sanders vowed to continue on in an attempt to push Biden to the left. For a second straight week, Sanders didn’t deliver a primary night speech. Instead – earlier in the evening – Sanders gave an address on his proposals to combat the coronavirus outbreak and the economic downturn spurred by the pandemic. His plan – with a $2 trillion price tag – called for $2000 per month checks to help families dealing with the burgeoning economic downturn caused by the coronavirus. Sanders made no mention of Tuesday’s contests.  Now – as calls for him to suspend his campaign and back Biden are likely to grow as the math doesn’t add up anymore for the senator – Sanders will need to make on a decision on what’s best not just for his campaign but for this wider movement.  And that’s a decision he’ll likely make with major input from his wife Jane – who’s also a senior adviser on the campaign.

"                          Coronavirus task force gives update on outbreak response at the White House. We are finally -- thankfully -- in the midst of a full-scale national mobilization to minimize the impact of this dreaded virus. President Trump has finally -- thankfully -- changed his tone about what he now calls an “invisible enemy,” and saying of the situation, “it’s bad.” In ordering more sweeping action, the president now says the virus may not peak until July or August. Man, have we lost a lot of time. As recently as three days ago, Trump was saying such things as “just relax,” “it will all pass,” and “we’re going to all be great.” THE VIRUS ERA: HITS AND MISSES BY TRUMP, BIDEN AND SANDERS By the time the president shifted gears, many governors, mayors and business leaders had already taken drastic steps, closing down colleges and schools, restaurants, theaters and sports clubs. It seemed radical when California and New York barred gatherings of more than 250 or 500 people; Trump is now telling Americans not to hang out with more than 10 people. What changed? One factor, according to the New York Times, is a British report finding that “without action by the government and individuals to slow the spread of coronavirus and suppress new cases, 2.2 million people in the United States could die.” Deborah Birx, a leader of the White House task force, said the administration viewed the report as important. But the British researchers shared the findings with the White House about a week ago. Not surprisingly, the president is taking a hit in the polls. In a NPR/PBS “NewsHour” survey, 37 percent say they have a good amount or a great deal of trust in virus information they hear from Trump, while 60 percent say they don’t have very much trust in the president’s words. Meanwhile, despite the new mood of national seriousness, Trump has been getting into spats with Democratic governors about the virus response. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said on MSNBC that “to hear the leader of the federal government telling us to work around the federal government because it’s too slow, it’s kind of mind-boggling, to be honest.” The president tweeted: “Failing Michigan Governor must work harder and be much more proactive. We are pushing her to get the job done. I stand with Michigan.” Similarly, after Andrew Cuomo said the feds need to do more, Trump tweeted yesterday that the New York governor wants “all states to be treated the same,” but “all states aren’t the same...Andrew, keep politics out of it.” Cuomo’s response: “YOU have to do something! You’re supposed to be the president.” There was a cease-fire hours later, though, however, when Cuomo told reporters he takes Trump at his word that he’ll try to help New York. The president said he and Cuomo are both doing a good job. The big headline out of yesterday’s White House presser was Steve Mnuchin saying they want to start sending Americans checks over the next two weeks to cushion the financial blow of the crisis. The Treasury chief provided no details, but did say that millionaires shouldn’t get such checks, indicating some type of means test. The White House had favored a payroll tax cut, but that would take months to have much impact. Obviously sensitive to criticism over his earlier efforts to downplay the virus, Trump said yesterday he “felt this was a pandemic long before it was a pandemic.” There is still something of a zig-zag pattern to the virus debate: Appeals to national unity are interspersed with partisan sniping on both sides. There’s no way to take politics completely out of the process, but I think Americans would appreciate a greater sense of cooperation, which has been MIA in Washington in recent years. SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES My business is also getting failing grades. In a new Morning Consult/Hollywood Reporter poll, exactly half of those questioned believe the media are overhyping the virus crisis. The survey found that just 17 percent of respondents have “a lot” of trust in virus information provided by network news. For newspapers the figure was 14 percent, and 13 percent for cable news networks. That is a vote of no confidence, and puts these media outlets behind the relatively low scores for Trump (20 percent) and Mike Pence (18 percent). And the most trusted on the coronavirus: the CDC (50 percent) and WHO (43 percent). That faith in medical experts helps explain why Trump has Anthony Fauci play such a front-and-center role at the daily briefings.

Following his overwhelming losses Tuesday to former Vice President Joe Biden in Democratic presidential primaries in Florida, Illinois and Arizona, Sen. Bernie Sanders needs to face the fact that Biden will be the party’s presidential nominee. In the interest of party unity and to help send President Trump into retirement, it’s time for Sanders to end his presidential campaign. Voters across the country have clearly have shown that they prefer Biden’s message of pragmatic progressive change to Sanders’ calls for a democratic socialist revolution.

And Democratic voters across the country have said in many polls that defeating Trump is their top priority. Here are some takeaways from the three primaries held Tuesday: Biden won big Biden’s margin of victory over Sanders was nearly 40 points in Florida and 23 points in Illinois with almost all votes counted, and about 12 points in Arizona with 87 percent of precincts reporting. And Biden received strong support from African-Americans; rural and suburban voters; Catholics, Protestants and Jews; blue-collar workers; and older voters. Biden won every county in Florida. This broad support cuts the legs out from under Sanders’ argument that he is the candidate of the people while Biden is the candidate of the Democratic establishment and billionaire donors.  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Latino and younger voters are warming to Biden Biden chipped away at Sanders’ coalition of progressive young people and Latinos. In Florida, exit polls showed Biden got 56 percent of the Cuban-American vote and 65 percent of the Puerto Rican vote. And among progressive voters in Florida, Biden won 53 percent to Sanders’ 37 percent. The coronavirus is a top concern for voters The coronavirus has replaced health care as the top concern among many voters and their concern continues to grow.  In both Florida and Illinois, more voters said they trusted Biden on health care issues than Sanders. In speeches Tuesday night both Biden and Sanders spoke of the need to protect Americans from the coronavirus pandemic. But Sanders touted his costly and controversial “Medicare-for-all” plan, while Biden spoke of unity and said Americans must come together on a bipartisan basis battle the virus that is sweeping across the world. Most voters in all three of the states with primaries Tuesday said they have anxieties about contracting COVID-19. As many as 40 percent in Florida are very concerned that they or a family member could become infected and about a third in Illinois and Arizona feel the same way.

If Sanders continues to battle Biden in remaining primaries, the only thing he will accomplish is to strengthen Trump’s reelection chances.

"                          A look at what's in&nbsp;Bernie Sanders' coronavirus plan The Democratic presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders said Wednesday the Vermont senator will spend the next several weeks assessing the future of his campaign after a string of losses to former Vice President Joe Biden. “The next primary contest is at least three weeks away. Sen. Sanders is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign,” Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement Wednesday morning. “In the immediate term, however, he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and ensuring that we take care of working people and the most vulnerable,” Shakir added. SANDERS AT CROSSROADS AS BIDEN'S LEAD GROWS AND CORONAVIRUS FREEZES RACE Shakir’s comments came the morning after the populist senator from Vermont was swept in Tuesday’s three Democratic presidential nomination primaries by Biden. The former vice president’s landslide victory in Florida, his crushing defeat of Sanders in Illinois, and his win in Arizona cemented his status as the presumptive Democratic nominee and all but closed the senator’s extremely narrow path for any potential comeback to win the nomination. On Tuesday, for a second straight week, Sanders didn’t deliver a primary night speech. Instead, earlier in the evening, the senator delivered an address on the nation’s response coronavirus outbreak. His plan – which he acknowledges comes with a $2 trillion price tag – called for $2,000 per month checks to help families dealing with the burgeoning economic downturn caused by the coronavirus. Sanders made no mention during those comments of Tuesday’s contests, which may be the last to be held in the Democratic race for quite some time. As most Americans self-isolate at home as the coronavirus pandemic sweeps the nation, states with upcoming primaries and caucuses are quickly postponing their nominating contests. CORONAVIRUS UPENDS PRIMARY CALENDAR, EVEN THREATENS SUMMER CONVENTIONS Now, as calls for him to suspend his campaign and back Biden are likely to grow as the math doesn’t add up anymore for the senator, Sanders will need to make a decision on what’s best not just for his campaign but to make sure that his political revolution continues the progressive fight. And that’s a decision he’ll likely make with major input from his wife Jane – who’s also a senior adviser on the campaign.

"                          The foreign ministry wants journalists working for the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post to hand back their press cards within 10 days. The war of words between the Trump administration and China over the origin of coronavirus has escalated as President Trump is going out of his way to call it the ""Chinese Virus"" and China has embarked on a propaganda campaign to shift blame for the pandemic away from the Chinese Communist Party's handling of the crisis. The escalation comes as the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread in the United States, shutting down sporting events, restaurants, bars and elections across the country. ""I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously,"" Trump tweeted Wednesday morning, commenting on news coverage about his response to the pandemic -- one of three Wednesday morning tweets referencing the ""Chinese Virus."" CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW TRUMP TELLS PEOPLE OUT OF WORK OVER CORONAVIRUS THAT 'MONEY WILL SOON BE COMING TO YOU' Minutes earlier he tweeted: ""I will be having a news conference today to discuss very important news from the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] concerning the Chinese Virus!"" Trump also repeatedly called the pathogen, which causes a disease officially called COVID-19, the ""Chinese virus,"" in remarks at a White House coronavirus briefing Tuesday afternoon. CORONAVIRUS CASES TOP 200,000 WORLDWIDE, DEATH TOLL PASSES 8,000 Almost simultaneously, China moved to continue its propaganda war over the coronavirus by kicking out a subset of journalists from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post whose press credentials would expire before the end of this year. ""The Chinese Communist Party's decision to expel journalists from China and Hong Kong is yet another step toward depriving the Chinese people and the World of access to true information about China,"" the White House's National Security Council tweeted Tuesday in response to the decision. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HITS BACK AFTER CHINA KICKS OUT US JOURNALISTS AMID CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has also stepped into the fray. On Monday he called People’s Republic of China Politburo member Yang Jiechi to push back on a tweet from the deputy director-general for the Chinese Foreign Ministry's Information Department. The deputy director-general, Lijian Zhao, tweeted that the United States military might be responsible for the coronavirus. He provided no evidence to that effect. ""Secretary Pompeo conveyed strong U.S. objections to PRC efforts to shift blame for COVID-19 to the United States,"" State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said in a Monday statement. ""The secretary stressed that this is not the time to spread disinformation and outlandish rumors, but rather a time for all nations to come together to fight this common threat."" This comes as a variety of American officials continue to tailor their language around the coronavirus to call it the ""Wuhan virus"" or ""Chinese coronavirus"" over the objections of China and American liberals who have said that calling the coronavirus anything that indicates it is from China or Wuhan, the city in China where the virus is from, is racist. That list includes Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Pompeo himself. POMPEO CONDEMNS CHINA'S 'EFFORTS TO SHIFT' CORONAVIRUS BLAME ON US IN CALL WITH COMMUNIST PARTY OFFICIAL Zhao, whose job is essentially to spread propaganda for China's oppressive regime – which has detained between one and five million Uighur Muslims in ""re-education"" camps that are essentially forced labor or concentration camps – has been sharing glowing stories of China's global response to the coronavirus despite the fact the nation's lack of transparency during its initial spread contributed to the seriousness of the pandemic. As early as last Wednesday Trump National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien was clearly assigning China with the responsibility for the coronavirus pandemic. ""Unfortunately, rather than using best practices, this outbreak in Wuhan was covered up,"" O'Brien said at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative-leaning think tank in Washington. ""There's lots of open-source reporting from China, from Chinese nationals, that the doctors involved were either silenced or put in isolation, or that sort of thing, so that the word of this virus could not get out. It probably cost the world community two months."" Zhao has also shared comments by Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Geng Shuang saying American efforts to move its medical supply chain back from the communist nation are ""unrealistic and unhelpful"" after China hinted at reducing its medical exports to the U.S., plunging America into ""the mighty sea of coronavirus."" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., has introduced a bill in the Senate aimed at doing just that. ""We’re looking at potential shortages of up to 150 commonly prescribed antibiotics and anti-viral medications,"" Hawley explained on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" last month. ""That’s bad. The problem is in whole or in part, these drugs are made in China.""

""For the people that are now out of work because of the important and necessary containment policies, for instance the shutting down of hotels, bars and restaurants, money will soon be coming to you,"" Trump tweeted. ""The onslaught of the Chinese Virus is not your fault!

The White House announced Wednesday that a visit next month by the king and queen of Spain would be postponed in order to allow both countries to give their full attention to the coronavirus pandemic. “In order for the United States and Spain to continue to devote their full resources and attention to the COVID-19 response, the April 21, 2020, White House State Visit by Their Majesties King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain has been postponed,” the White House said in a statement.

"                          Administration officials hope to convince congressional Republicans to pony up hundreds of billions of dollars to keep businesses and taxpayers afloat; chief White House correspondent John Roberts reports. President Trump, in an attempt to calm the thousands of Americans who have applied for unemployment or have been furloughed due to the spread of coronavirus, said Wednesday that “money will soon be coming to you,” while stressing that the virus outbreak is not the “fault” of workers. “For the people that are now out of work because of the important and necessary containment policies, for instance the shutting down of hotels, bars and restaurants, money will soon be coming to you,” he tweeted Wednesday. “The onslaught of the Chinese Virus is not your fault! Will be stronger than ever,” he continued, adding that he “will totally protect your Medicare & Social Security!” The president’s tweet comes after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Tuesday said that the federal government is looking to send checks to Americans “in the next two weeks” in an effort to help people cope with the economic fallout due to the coronavirus pandemic. TRUMP WANTS TO SEND CHECKS TO AMERICAN FAMILIES 'IMMEDIATELY,' MNUCHIN SAYS  “We’re looking at sending checks to Americans immediately,” Mnuchin said Tuesday during a press conference from the White House. “Americans need cash now, the president wants to get cash now. I mean now—in the next few weeks.” Mnuchin added: “The president has instructed me we have to do this now.” Mnuchin did not offer specifics during the press briefing on Tuesday, except to say that the amount sent to American families would be significant and that millionaires would not receive the relief. Fox News has learned, however, that Mnuchin is pressing GOP senators for a package that would send more than $200 billion of payments to Americans by early April. The White House is currently in negotiations with lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Congress to approve a sweeping economic stimulus package of nearly $850 billion to help U.S. businesses and taxpayers deal with the economic fallout from the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus. Despite the fact that businesses have closed and instituted telework policies for employees due to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention containment guidelines to stem the spread of the virus, Mnuchin said the Trump administration would not extend the April 15 deadline to file taxes, noting that much of the tax filing can be done online. “We encourage Americans who can file taxes to continue to file taxes on April 15 because for many Americans, you will get tax refunds and we don’t want you to lose out on those tax refunds,” he said. Mnuchin added that if individuals or corporations owe money to the Internal Revenue Service after filing their taxes, those payments now are able to be deferred for up to 90 days, interest-free. “If you owe a payment to the IRS, you can defer up to $1 million as an individual, and $10 million to corporations, interest-free and penalty-free for 90 days,” Mnuchin continued. “File your taxes, you’ll automatically not get charged interests or penalties.” The World Health Organization designated COVID-19 a global pandemic last week.

The president also announced a temporary halt on air travel to the United States from Europe, now including flights from the United Kingdom, but excluding those carrying cargo. When asked Tuesday whether he would limit domestic travel, the president replied: “It’s possible.” The coronavirus task force also predicted Tuesday that the number of cases in the U.S. could peak in approximately 45-days.

"                          Ohio postpones primary over coronavirus concerns; Ohio Governor Mark DeWine speaks out. The day after Ohio postponed its primary elections due to concerns about spreading the coronavirus -- and despite a recommendation from Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, that the state hold its election on June 2 -- there is still not a clear plan for when or how Ohio voters will cast their ballots in their primary elections. Amid growing fears of the spread of the coronavirus, and warnings from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention against large gatherings, DeWine filed a suit Monday in a lower court to get the state's primary elections postponed. The court ruled against him, and DeWine decided that he would keep the polls closed anyway, ordering state Director of Health Dr. Amy Action to use broad powers given to her under Ohio law to prevent the spread of disease to order the election be stopped. ""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,"" DeWine said when announcing the decision. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW TRUMP ANNOUNCES TELEHEALTH SERVICES WILL EXPAND FOR SENIORS The Ohio Supreme Court then early Tuesday morning refused to grant an 11th-hour request to force DeWine to hold the election, giving at least a tacit legal endorsement of the governor's move. But unlike other states, an election day can only be set by the state legislature or a court in Ohio. Because of that, when DeWine declared that he would not allow polls to open Tuesday for public health reasons, neither he nor anybody in his administration had the authority to actually change the election to a new date as has happened in other states. So, as of Wednesday morning, Ohio voters have not yet had their say in who will be the Democratic nominee for president or in primaries for a variety of other offices, and they don't have any set alternative to cast their ballots. There also appears to be no consensus idea for how or when to hold the primaries. DeWine and Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose indicated that they wanted to move the primary to June 2, and LaRose essentially declared it so in a directive issued Monday. ""On Tuesday, June 2, 2020, boards of elections must conduct in-person voting at polling locations in their county,"" the directive reads. That directive is linked to voter information web pages including the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections and the Ohio Democratic County Chairs Association. LOS ANGELES VOTES TO LET HOMELESS KEEP TENTS UP DURING DAY AMID CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK That directive from the Republican LaRose drew harsh criticism from House Minority Leader, Democrat Emilia Sykes, for what she said was ""sharing inaccurate information during a time of chaos when Ohioans are turning to him for truth and guidance."" ""As the state's chief election officer, Secretary LaRose is uniquely charged with the proper execution of a fair election in the state of Ohio. That includes sharing accurate information. What has transpired in recent hours has been anything but,"" Sykes said in a Tuesday statement. ""Now in the hours following the chaos, he continues to send out press releases and share information on his website saying the election day has been moved to June 2nd. That is just wrong. As the governor has noted, and state law requires, only the legislature or the court has the power to set or change the election date and thus far, neither entity has done that. Yet LaRose continues to suggest people can continue to vote absentee in direct violation of state law. This too is wrong."" The state's Democratic Pary chairman, David Pepper, has said that he does not think a June 2 election is sufficient and also made clear that neither DeWine nor LaRose can unilaterally set a new election day. FOX NEWS VOTER ANALYSIS: BIDEN WINS BIG, CORONAVIRUS ON VOTERS' MINDS ""Unfortunately, the proposed June 2 in-person primary arguably lacked legal authority but also brought with it major problems,"" Pepper said in a statement on Facebook Tuesday night. ""The lateness of it is highly problematic for a host of reasons, including missing deadlines to send delegates to nominating conventions. And it is iffy to think this virus crisis will be resolved by then to even have in-person voting."" Pepper did, however, indicate that DeWine was open to working on multiple possibilities, saying the governor had indicated ""that there was no 'magic' to his June 2 proposal."" In a statement on behalf of the state Democratic Party, Pepper said it had filed a suit with the Ohio Supreme Court to ensure that no legal technicalities ended up preventing Ohio voters from getting their chance to cast a ballot. JUSSIE SMOLLETT PROSECUTOR KIM FOXX WINS DEM PRIMARY IN HOTLY CONTESTED RACE ""Earlier today we said that we would litigate to defend voters’ right to fully participate in the state’s Democratic primary election, and in the absence of action by the General Assembly and with other actors moving to shut down the primary, we have filed with the Ohio Supreme Court to ensure that all eligible Ohio voters are able to exercise their right to vote in this primary,"" Pepper said. ""Yesterday’s actions did not create unchecked authority with the governor or secretary of state to run a new election. So authority for a new election must come from the legislature or from a court."" On ways to potentially hold an election, Pepper said on Fox News Tuesday afternoon that he would prefer extended vote-by-mail and potentially a curbside drop-off voting option. Apparently understanding that they would have to go through further steps in either the legislature or the courts, DeWine and LaRose issued a joint statement Tuesday scaling back the ""must[s]"" used in LaRose's Monday night directive to strong suggestions for how Ohioans should be able to vote in their primaries. ""Last night, the actions taken by Ohio Department of Health Director Dr. Amy Acton saved Ohio lives,"" the statement read. ""By preventing Ohioans from going to polling locations, we averted a situation which would have gone against the most recent scientific evidence available and could have dangerously advanced the spread of coronavirus across Ohio."" It continued: ""As we move forward, it is vitally important that Ohioans have a significant period of time to cast mail-in absentee ballots and an opportunity to vote in-person, as was provided in the directive issued last night by the Secretary of State."" SANDERS AT CROSSROADS, AS BIDEN EXPANDS LEAD AND CORONAVIRUS PANIC FREEZES ELECTION CALENDAR On the legislative side of things, Republican Senate President Larry Obhof issued a statement Tuesday afternoon saying he would work with LaRose and DeWine to find a legislative solution to Ohio's election confusion. ""We recognize the difficult position the state is in and the need to protect public health, while maintaining citizens' access to all of their rights, including the right to vote,"" Obhof said. ""The Senate will work collaboratively with the Governor and the Secretary of State in the coming days on any legislation necessary to deal with this unique and challenging set of circumstances, including determining a new date for the primary election... I believe that it is important for the Governor, Secretary of State, and legislature to work together in this time of crisis."" State Senate Minority Leader Kenny Yuko, a Democrat, also said that he thinks the legislature should be the body that addresses how a new election should be held. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""The legislature has to quickly address the confusion caused by moving the primary election on such short notice,"" he said in a statement. ""The fate of many community levies and local issues hangs in the balance and wrapping up the primary before June 2 should still be on the table... Our caucus will be putting forward our ideas on how to address this, and other critical issues facing Ohioans, before our next session day."" By the time Ohio straightens out its election situation, however, it appears unlikely its votes will matter in the presidential primaries. President Trump clinched the GOP nomination for president Tuesday and former Vice President Joe Biden expanded his delegate lead over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders with wins in the three states that did hold elections Tuesday -- Arizona, Florida and Illinois. But Yuko is correct that Ohioans will still have other local races and issues to decide once it figures out how it will hold its postponed elections, whenever and however that is.

The president’s daughter’s post called for families to make the best of their time at home together during the coronavirus outbreak, suggesting they have a “living room camp out” along with sandwiches and other treats. “A fun activity that also brings family together for a meal!” the 38-year-old Trump wrote.

Then, mocking Trump’s tweet, Omar invited the first daughter to “Share your ideas on how you plan to unite them.” The Minnesota Democrat’s response drew numerous critical reactions, with many suggesting that Omar’s recent divorce and subsequent remarriage – to a man with whom she was allegedly having an extramarital affair – made her unqualified to criticize another woman’s comments on the subject of family. “Why do you need to be so hateful?” one responder asked Omar. “Ivanka shared a simple family suggestion and you had to be spiteful and mean. Not something a true leader would do. Awful. I’m praying for this country to heal in all ways. You should try it.” ""Why do you need to be so hateful?

Sanders is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign,” Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement Wednesday morning. “In the immediate term, however, he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and ensuring that we take care of working people and the most vulnerable,” Shakir added.

Once there, they’ll begin holding conversations with supporters to get input and assess the path forward for our campaign. We will keep you updated as those conversations progress.” Shakir’s comments came the morning after the populist senator from Vermont was swept in Tuesday’s three Democratic presidential nomination primaries by Biden. The former vice president’s landslide victory in Florida, his crushing defeat of Sanders in Illinois, and his win in Arizona cemented his status as the presumptive Democratic nominee and all but closed the senator’s extremely narrow path for any potential comeback to win the nomination. On Tuesday, for a second straight week, Sanders didn’t deliver a primary night speech. Instead, earlier in the evening, the senator delivered an address on the nation’s response coronavirus outbreak. His plan – which he acknowledges comes with a $2 trillion price tag – called for $2,000 per month checks to help families dealing with the burgeoning economic downturn caused by the coronavirus. Sanders made no mention during those comments of Tuesday’s contests, which may be the last to be held in the Democratic race for quite some time. As most Americans self-isolate at home as the coronavirus pandemic sweeps the nation, states with upcoming primaries and caucuses are quickly postponing their nominating contests.

"                          Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says the economy is slowing to a standstill as COVID-19 spreads. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer warned Wednesday that the U.S. will “almost certainly” see a recession due to the effects of the rapidly spreading coronavirus. During remarks on the Senate floor, Schumer, D-N.Y., said the novel coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, “continues to test our nation in new and difficult ways.” TRUMP TELLS PEOPLE 'MONEY WILL SOON BE COMING TO YOU' “Our public health system is understaffed and under-resourced and without intervention, it could soon become overwhelmed,” Schumer said. “Even as the market shifts from day to day, coronavirus is slowing our economy to a near standstill and we’re almost certainly anticipating a recession,” he continued. “Go to the streets of many cities, towns and villages—they’re empty. Schools are closed in large portions of the country and businesses are struggling not to lay off workers because they don’t have customers, don’t have clients, don’t have income.” Schumer went on to say that there “is a great urgency here.” President Trump previously said a recession is possible. On Wednesday, in the opening minutes of trading, U.S. equity markets plunged, removing all gains from earlier in the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,268 points, or 5.9 percent, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were lower by 5.4 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively. Trading is halted if the S&P 500 falls by 7 percent. The instability in the markets came as the Trump administration was negotiating with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to hammer out the details of a stimulus package that could reach $1 trillion to help U.S. businesses and taxpayers deal with the economic fallout. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, opening the Senate on Tuesday morning, promised swift action, though there is no clear timeline on when the Senate will vote on the package. ""The Senate will not adjourn until we have passed significant and bold new steps above and beyond what the House has passed to help our strong nation and our strong underlying economy weather this storm,"" McConnell said. The Trump administration’s stimulus package is bigger than the 2008 bank bailout, and the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which was passed and signed under former President Barack Obama, and totaled $787 billion to help stabilize the economy about 14 months after the last recession began. MARKET PLUNGES, OIL CRATERS AS CONGRESS WEIGHS $1 TRILLION STIMULUS Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday that President Trump wants him to send checks to Americans within “the next two weeks” in an effort to help people cope with the economic fallout due to the COVID-19 spread. Trump, on Wednesday, in an attempt to calm the thousands of Americans who have already applied for unemployment or have been furloughed due to the spread of the virus, said that “money will soon be coming to you.” “For the people that are now out of work because of the important and necessary containment policies, for instance the shutting down of hotels, bars and restaurants, money will soon be coming to you,” he tweeted Wednesday. The World Health Organization designated COVID-19 a global pandemic last week. Trump announced a national emergency on Friday. The president also announced a temporary halt on air travel to the United States from Europe, now including flights from the United Kingdom, but excluding those carrying cargo. When asked Tuesday whether he would limit domestic travel, the president replied: “It’s possible.” The coronavirus task force also predicted Tuesday that the number of cases in the U.S. could peak in approximately 45 days. As of Wednesday morning, there were more than 6,500 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States, in all 50 states, including Washington, D.C. The U.S., so far, has seen 115 coronavirus-related deaths.

"                          Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell provides updates on the coronavirus funding bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., vowed Wednesday that the Senate will not rest until it passes legislation to help Americans facing the economic effects of the coronavirus outbreak, vowing a “historic injection of liquidity” to boost the economy. McConnell said that while the Senate will pass the House’s latest bill, they still need to pass additional legislation to help small businesses, which he said are left vulnerable even under the House bill. CORONAVIRUS CASES TOP 200,000 WORLDWIDE, DEATH TOLL PASSES 8,000 “Everyone agrees that workers need relief. Republicans are working on bold solutions to help individuals and families as we speak, but small businesses need relief as well,” McConnell said on the Senate floor Wednesday morning. The Kentucky Republican cited restrictions that his home state will be imposing that include the forced closures of bars and restaurants, similar to what is already taking place in New York City and elsewhere. “Nobody expects main street small businesses of any sort to hold the kind of cash buffer they would need to remain in business and wait out a national economic disruption that could last for weeks or months,” McConnell said. “They need help. They need a lifeline.” That lifeline, McConnell explained, will be in the form of a “historic injection of liquidity and access to credit,” and “Washington working directly with the lenders who already work with these small businesses to minimize the new bureaucracy so the assistance can flow as fast as possible.” TRUMP ANNOUNCES US, CANADA CLOSING BORDER TO 'NON-ESSENTIAL TRAFFIC' AMID CORONAVIRUS FEARS McConnell reiterated that the Senate will pass the House bill and that its “imperfections will just make our more comprehensive package even more urgent.” He promised that he and his fellow senators will keep working until it gets done. “The Senate is not going to leave small business behind,” he said. But the aid to small businesses is “just one component” of the Senate’s work, McConnell said, adding that senators are currently looking at “the best pathway to put money directly in the hands of the American people.” Sending checks directly to Americans is a concept that currently enjoys bipartisan support from figures including Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, as well as the White House. McConnell also discussed “targeted relief” for “key industries that are shouldering an outsized burden from the public health directives.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Republican leader also praised individual Americans for taking action as they wait for Congress to assist them, describing how some grocery stores are dedicating early hours specifically to senior citizens so those at risk can avoid crowds, and parents at home are volunteering to help with child care. “This is what makes the United States of America what it is, and it is what we are today,” he said. “Generosity, friendship, resolve, and strength. This is not a challenge anyone wanted for our nation, but it is a challenge we will overcome.”    ",         McConnell vows 'historic injection' of aid to save small businesses in face of coronavirus,         2020-03-18T112754-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/mcconnell-vows-historic-injection-of-aid-to-save-small-businesses-in-face-of-coronavirus,Fox

As the Trump impeachment saga raged on in December, the House Democrats' Twitter account posted that ""President Trump has abused his power and must be held accountable."" ""Democrats know they cannot win in this climate, and so they have decided to impeach the president,"" the Senate Republicans' account posted in January, quoting Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C. Twitter accounts for the House Republicans, Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, the Republican Governors Association and more have joined the House Democrats and Senate Republicans in putting down their political swords -- for now -- and instead sharing information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), updating Americans on national and state governments' latest actions and warning people about the potentially disastrous effects of allowing the coronavirus to go on unchecked. ER PHYSICIAN DIAGNOSED WITH CORONAVIRUS 'HORRIFIED' THAT HE MAY HAVE EXPOSED OTHERS Some accounts, including the Senate Democrats' official account and the National Republican Congressional Committee, have continued sharing partisan posts. But they are generally outnumbered by those which have focused on fighting the coronavirus, especially as the threat has become more serious in the United States in the past week -- a development that has led even President Trump to shift his initially dismissive tone on the disease. In remarks on the Senate floor Wednesday morning, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell updated the chamber on its latest efforts to pass a stimulus package before sharing some stories from his home state on individual Americans coming together to stem the spread of the virus which causes a disease officially known as COVID-19. ""Even amidst the uncertainty, the American people are stepping up and reminding everyone what solidarity and citizenship look like,"" McConnell said. ""In my home state, Kentuckians are going out of their way to stand with their neighbors. Stay at home parents are volunteering to help neighbors with childcare when parents are unable to telework. Grocery stores in the Lowell area are setting aside the first hour they're open each day, right after their cleaning, so older shoppers, and those with underlying conditions, can shop first.""

"                          Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says the economy is slowing to a standstill as COVID-19 spreads. Green New Deal activists released their long list of priorities for a coronavirus economic relief, pitching a $2,000 a month payment to Americans and a break from bills during the crisis. The former chief of staff to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted out the list of federal actions progressives will push for as Washington is moving swiftly on the third round of legislation to respond to the global pandemic. Comparing the federal response needed to Great Depression and World War II mobilizations, the activists want to suspend the rule requiring Treasury to issue new debt for financing to create ""debt-free money,"" demanding the Fed open its discount window lending immediately to small businesses and dropping ""helicopter money"" into taxpayers' bank, Venmo or PayPal accounts. The ask list, authored by the New Consensus activists behind the Green New Deal, also calls for direct support for small businesses, investment in building stockpiles of medical goods, foods and fuels, temporary suspension of certain tariffs and other trade impediments. AOC RIPS CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL AS 'COMPLETELY INSUFFICIENT,' CALLS FOR CASH INFUSIONS, REIMBURSING STUDENTS But perhaps the most immediate relief to workers would be $1,000 biweekly in universal basic income support for at least six months. The current proposals of $1,000 don't go far enough, they argue, and at least $2,000 month is needed for everyone. Consumers should also get a break from all their debt payments for six months, including credit card debt, student debt, mortgage and lease payments. There should also be a nationwide moratorium on debt and mortgage foreclosures, the activists said. The progressive groups are aligned with Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Some of the ideas have already gotten support from the politicians in a position to vote on such measures and influence policy. Sanders backed the $ 2,000-a-month proposal Tuesday night as he suffered another round of losses in his bid for the White House. CORONAVIRUS CASES TOP 200,000 WORLDWIDE, DEATH TOLL PASSES 8,000 ""We need to provide a direct emergency $2,000 cash payment to every household in American every month for the duration of the crisis,"" Sanders said. He also backed a hold on student loan payments, a moratorium on evictions and foreclosures, and expanding the eligibility for unemployment benefits to gig workers and freelancers and upping the benefits checks maximum to $75,000 a year. For her part, Ocasio-Cortez has also pitched big bold ideas, saying the response so far has been ""completely insufficient."" She's also pushing direct cash payments, suspending all rent, mortgage and debt payments, expanded unemployment insurance and universal health care. ""What people are dealing with is a liquidity issue,"" Ocasio-Cortez told 1010 WINS on Wednesday. ""While cutting checks is an important part of an equation, I don't think it's going to help if it's the only action that taken. We need to take a look at mortgage, rent and student loan payment suspension to give people that buffer time."" Ocasio-Cortez wants priority on public transit funds over airline relief and has pushed for free subway rides. She's blasted the airlines for using their profits to buy up stock rather than raising wages or making other investments. She's demanded a ban on stock buybacks if any federal bailout happens for corporate industries. ""I personally think that it's much more worthwhile for us to bail out our public transportation than the airline industry,"" Ocasio-Cortez told the radio station. ""...That investment in public infrastructure hasn't happened. I support federal funds to MTA  (Metropolitan Transportation Authority) and I personally would like to see the MTA be free or extraordinarily reduced."" Some Republicans, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Sen. Mitt Romney, have backed direct-cash payments. The administration is pushing a massive stimulus package. But progressives are leery that their ideas don't go far enough in terms of the length of payments, amount of money and scope of eligibility. Meanwhile, Sen. Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the Senate, is pushing his own $750 billion stimulus. It doesn't include direct payments to Americans but boosts public health capacity, expands unemployment benefits, provides low-interest loans to small businesses, cancels student loan payments and gives priority to workers in any targeted bailout of industries.

"                          New York hospitals only have a total of 53,000 beds; Laura Ingle reports New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday that President Trump agreed to dispatch a Navy hospital ship to the New York City Harbor to “add capacity” for those who need to be admitted due to complications of coronavirus. Cuomo has warned that the virus puts stress on New York state hospitals, and that the state’s hospital system only has 53,000 beds. For days, he has weighed how to create additional space for the expected influx of patients in the coming days and weeks due to the virus.  TRUMP TO SEND CHECKS TO AMERICANS IN COMING WEEKS, MNUCHIN SAYS Cuomo, during a press conference Wednesday, said that the president agreed to dispatch the USNS Comfort hospital ship, which the Pentagon offered as part of the domestic response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The USNS Comfort has 1,000 beds and is run by military personnel, according to the U.S. Naval Institute. “The president will dispatch it immediately,” Cuomo said, noting the ship will remain in New York City harbor. Cuomo added that New York City is the ""natural"" place for the ship to dock, noting the ""density"" of the population. NYC MAY ISSUE SHELTER-IN-PLACE ORDER OVER SPREAD OF COVID-19 ""We must increase the current hospital capacity,"" he said. After the press conference, Cuomo tweeted: ""The federal government is sending a hospital ship to New York, the USNS Comfort."" ""The Comfort, which has about 1,000 rooms on it, will be moored in New York Harbor,"" Cuomo continued. ""Hospital beds are what we need."" The announcement came after Cuomo repeatedly called for the Army Corps of Engineers to help build new hospitals to manage the outbreak. New York state currently has the most cases of coronavirus, or COVID-19, in the country with more than 1,700 positive cases reported by Wednesday morning, and 16 virus-related deaths. Defense Secretary Mark Esper told Fox News Tuesday that the U.S. military ""remains ready and capable of defending the American people, protecting the nation and safeguarding our interests abroad."" Field hospitals and a fleet of hospital ships could be called in to help with overflow capacity of infected patients, he said. The USNS Comfort was in port in Norfolk, Va. undergoing repairs after a six-month tour in South America and would not be ready to arrive in New York until ""mid April"" at the earliest.  At this point, efforts are being made to expedite the timeline. But Esper said that the ship's capabilities, and field hospitals, ""are focused on trauma,"" rather than infectious disease. ""Whether it's our field hospitals or our hospital ships, they are focused on trauma. They do not have necessarily the space, the segreated s[ace, to deal with infectious disease,"" Esper told Fox News' Bret Baier Tuesday. ""We don't have any 500 bed hospitals designed for infectious disease...That does not exist in the inventory."" The U.S. Navy said Wednesday that despite the dispatch to areas affected by COVID-19, the ships will not treat patients who have fallen ill with the virus. ""The Comfort and Mercy will not deploy to treat COVID patients, but will be made available to assist with treatment of other patients in coastal locations where local health professionals are necessarily focused on a large number of COVID cases,"" the Navy said in a statement. As of mid-day Wednesday, the U.S. currently had more than 7,300 confirmed cases of coronavirus in all 50 states, including Washington, D.C. The U.S., so far, has seen 115 COVID-19-related deaths.

"                          The foreign ministry wants journalists working for the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post to hand back their press cards within 10 days. The war of words between the Trump administration and China over the origin of coronavirus has escalated as President Trump is going out of his way to call it the ""Chinese Virus"" and China has embarked on a propaganda campaign to shift blame for the pandemic away from the Chinese Communist Party's handling of the crisis. The escalation comes as the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread in the United States, shutting down sporting events, restaurants, bars and elections across the country. ""I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously,"" Trump tweeted Wednesday morning, commenting on news coverage about his response to the pandemic -- one of three Wednesday morning tweets referencing the ""Chinese Virus."" CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW TRUMP TELLS PEOPLE OUT OF WORK OVER CORONAVIRUS THAT 'MONEY WILL SOON BE COMING TO YOU' Minutes earlier he tweeted: ""I will be having a news conference today to discuss very important news from the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] concerning the Chinese Virus!"" Trump also repeatedly called the pathogen, which causes a disease officially called COVID-19, the ""Chinese virus,"" in remarks at a White House coronavirus briefing Tuesday afternoon before doubling down Wednesday afternoon when asked about his terminology by a reporter, who commented, ""a lot of people say it's racist."" ""Because it's from China. It's not racist at all, no. Not at all. It comes from China,"" Trump said. ""That's why. It comes from China. I want to be accurate."" CORONAVIRUS CASES TOP 200,000 WORLDWIDE, DEATH TOLL PASSES 8,000 At nearly the same time Trump was speaking in his coronavirus briefing Tuesday, China moved to continue its propaganda war over the coronavirus by kicking out a subset of journalists from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post whose press credentials would expire before the end of this year. ""The Chinese Communist Party's decision to expel journalists from China and Hong Kong is yet another step toward depriving the Chinese people and the World of access to true information about China,"" the White House's National Security Council tweeted Tuesday in response to the decision. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HITS BACK AFTER CHINA KICKS OUT US JOURNALISTS AMID CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has also stepped into the fray. On Monday he called People’s Republic of China Politburo member Yang Jiechi to push back on a tweet from the deputy director-general for the Chinese Foreign Ministry's Information Department. The deputy director-general, Lijian Zhao, tweeted that the United States military might be responsible for the coronavirus. He provided no evidence to that effect. ""Secretary Pompeo conveyed strong U.S. objections to PRC efforts to shift blame for COVID-19 to the United States,"" State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said in a Monday statement. ""The secretary stressed that this is not the time to spread disinformation and outlandish rumors, but rather a time for all nations to come together to fight this common threat."" Trump also addressed the topic Wednesday: ""As you know China tried to say at one point, maybe they stopped now, that it was caused by American soldiers. That can't happen. it's not gonna happen. Not as long as I'm president. It comes from China."" This comes as a variety of American officials continue to tailor their language around the coronavirus to call it the ""Wuhan virus"" or ""Chinese coronavirus"" over the objections of China and American liberals who have said that calling the coronavirus anything that indicates it is from China or Wuhan, the city in China where the virus is from, is racist. That list includes Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Pompeo himself. POMPEO CONDEMNS CHINA'S 'EFFORTS TO SHIFT' CORONAVIRUS BLAME ON US IN CALL WITH COMMUNIST PARTY OFFICIAL Zhao, whose job is essentially to spread propaganda for China's oppressive regime – which has detained between one and five million Uighur Muslims in ""re-education"" camps that are essentially forced labor or concentration camps – has been sharing glowing stories of China's global response to the coronavirus despite the fact the nation's lack of transparency during its initial spread contributed to the seriousness of the pandemic. As early as last Wednesday Trump National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien was clearly assigning China with the responsibility for the coronavirus pandemic. ""Unfortunately, rather than using best practices, this outbreak in Wuhan was covered up,"" O'Brien said at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative-leaning think tank in Washington. ""There's lots of open-source reporting from China, from Chinese nationals, that the doctors involved were either silenced or put in isolation, or that sort of thing, so that the word of this virus could not get out. It probably cost the world community two months."" Zhao has also shared comments by Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Geng Shuang saying American efforts to move its medical supply chain back from the communist nation are ""unrealistic and unhelpful"" after China hinted at reducing its medical exports to the U.S., plunging America into ""the mighty sea of coronavirus."" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., has introduced a bill in the Senate aimed at doing just that. ""We’re looking at potential shortages of up to 150 commonly prescribed antibiotics and anti-viral medications,"" Hawley explained on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" last month. ""That’s bad. The problem is in whole or in part, these drugs are made in China.""

""It can do a lot of good things if we need it,"" he said at a White House press conference. ""We'll have it all completed, signing it in just a little while."" TRUMP INVOKES DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT: WHAT IS IT? The act ensures the private sector can ramp-up manufacturing and distribution of emergency medical supplies and equipment. The move gives the White House the authority to increase production of masks, ventilators and respirators, as well as expand hospital capacity to combat the coronavirus. Asked if he saw the nation as being on a wartime footing he said he did and described himself as ""in a sense a wartime president."" He made the remarks at a press conference along members of the coronavirus pandemic task force. The U.S. has largely shuttered many aspects of daily life in order to stem the rapid onset of the virus, echoing efforts across the globe. As of Wednesday morning, there were 6,519 cases and 114 deaths in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that coronavirus deaths in the U.S. mirror what has been reported in other countries, with approximately 4 out of 5 deaths occurring in people 65 and older — and no deaths in children. TRUMP SAYS HUD WILL SUSPEND 'ALL FORECLOSURES AND EVICTIONS' AMID COVID-19 OUTBREAK The crisis has caused chaos in the markets and the economy as a whole. Schools have closed and restaurants and bars have been reduced to takeout and delivery in many parts of the country. San Francisco declared a shelter-in-place order this week, while many states have put restrictions on large gatherings. The administration has been working with Congress on a nearly $1 trillion stimulus package to reinvigorate the U.S. economy and to provide relief to businesses and workers who have been hit hardest by the crisis. On Wednesday, Trump also announced that the Housing Department is suspending all foreclosures and evictions until the end of April. Earlier in the day he had announced that the U.S. and Canada had agreed to temporarily close their shared border to non-essential traffic. Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the taskforce, announced that Health and Human Services are suspending a regulation that prevents medical professionals from practicing medicine across state lines.

"                          Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says the economy is slowing to a standstill as COVID-19 spreads. Green New Deal activists released their long list of priorities for a coronavirus economic relief, pitching a $2,000 a month payment to Americans and a break from bills during the crisis. The former chief of staff to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted out the list of federal actions progressives will push for as Washington is moving swiftly on the third round of legislation to respond to the global pandemic. Comparing the federal response needed to Great Depression and World War II mobilizations, the activists want to suspend the rule requiring Treasury to issue new debt for financing to create ""debt-free money"" and demand the Fed open its discount window lending immediately to small businesses. They've called for dropping ""helicopter money"" into taxpayers' bank, Venmo or PayPal accounts. The ask list, authored by the New Consensus activists behind the Green New Deal, also calls for direct support for small businesses, investment in building stockpiles of medical goods, foods and fuels, temporary suspension of certain tariffs and other trade impediments. AOC RIPS CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL AS 'COMPLETELY INSUFFICIENT,' CALLS FOR CASH INFUSIONS, REIMBURSING STUDENTS But perhaps the most immediate relief to workers would be $1,000 biweekly payments for at least six months. The current proposals of $1,000 per month don't go far enough, they argue, and at least $2,000 monthly is needed for everyone. Consumers should also get a break from all their debt payments for six months, including credit card debt, student debt, mortgage and lease payments. There should also be a nationwide moratorium on mortgage foreclosures, the activists said. The progressive groups are aligned with Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Some of the ideas have already gotten support from the politicians in a position to vote on such measures and influence policy. Sanders backed the $ 2,000-a-month proposal Tuesday night as he suffered another round of election losses in his bid for the White House. CORONAVIRUS CASES TOP 200,000 WORLDWIDE, DEATH TOLL PASSES 8,000 ""We need to provide a direct emergency $2,000 cash payment to every household in American every month for the duration of the crisis,"" Sanders said. He also backed a hold on student loan payments, a moratorium on evictions and foreclosures, and expanding the eligibility for unemployment benefits to gig workers and freelancers and upping the maximum benefit checks to $75,000 a year. For her part, Ocasio-Cortez has also pitched big bold ideas, saying the response so far has been ""completely insufficient."" She's also pushing direct cash payments, suspending all rent, mortgage and debt payments, expanded unemployment insurance and universal health care. ""What people are dealing with is a liquidity issue,"" Ocasio-Cortez told 1010 WINS on Wednesday. ""While cutting checks is an important part of an equation, I don't think it's going to help if it's the only action that taken. We need to take a look at mortgage, rent and student loan payment suspension to give people that buffer time."" Ocasio-Cortez wants priority on public transit funds over airline relief and has pushed for free subway rides. She's blasted the airlines for using their profits to buy up stock rather than raising wages or making other investments. She's demanded a ban on stock buybacks if any federal bailout happens for corporate industries. ""I personally think that it's much more worthwhile for us to bail out our public transportation than the airline industry,"" Ocasio-Cortez told the radio station. ""...That investment in public infrastructure hasn't happened. I support federal funds to MTA  (Metropolitan Transportation Authority) and I personally would like to see the MTA be free or extraordinarily reduced."" Some Republicans, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Sen. Mitt Romney, have backed direct cash payments. The administration is pushing a massive stimulus package that includes two rounds of payments worth $500 billion total. But progressives are leery the GOP plan doesn't go far enough in terms of the length of payments, amount of money and scope of eligibility. Meanwhile, Sen. Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the Senate, is pushing his own $750 billion stimulus that boosts public health capacity, expands unemployment benefits, provides low-interest loans to small businesses, cancels student loan payments and gives priority to workers in any targeted bailout of industries. It doesn't include direct payments to Americans.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) offices across the country will close as part of the effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus, the agency announced Wednesday. “Effective March 18, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is suspending in-person services at its field offices, asylum offices and Application Support Centers (ASCs) to help slow the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),” the agency said in a statement. IMMIGRANTS SEEKING NATURALIZATION WON'T BE PUNISHED IF THEY TEST FOR CORONAVIRUS, USCIS ANNOUNCES It said the suspension of services will last until at least April 1, although it will still process emergency requests. But asylum applications, naturalization ceremonies and other services will be postponed. The agency, which is the core agency dealing with most forms of legal immigration and asylum cases in the U.S., will send notices to immigrants and applicants affected by the delay, and interviews will be rescheduled, the statement said.

"                          Identifying the disease in patients has become the biggest challenge for health care providers; correspondent Laura Ingle reports from Oceanside, N.Y. Roughly half of Americans believe it will take at least a year before a vaccine for the coronavirus strain that causes COVID-19 becomes available, according to a new national poll. That timetable is in line with what most public health experts have said. But according to the new national poll by the Pew Research Center, about one fifth think a vaccine could be ready for mass consumption in just a few months. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW The survey – which was released on Wednesday – points to a partisan divide on when a vaccine would become available. Nearly three in 10 Republicans questioned said they thought it would just be a few months before a vaccine comes online. Only 17 percent of Democrats were optimistic about a speedy vaccine. There have been claims by some – including President Trump – about a quicker timetable for a vaccine. The president may have confused some Americans earlier this month when he appeared to blur the line between when vaccine trial testing would begin and when vaccines would be ready for widespread public use. There’s also a partisan divide over the origins of the virus.  Overall, the poll shows just over four in 10 Americans answered that the virus likely came about naturally. But about a quarter questioned said that it was intentionally developed in a lab. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK  Thirty percent of Republicans and independents who lean Republican said the coronavirus was intentionally created in a lab – compared with only 16 percent of Democrats and independents who lean toward the Democratic Party. Much of this misinformation may be coming from social media. Nearly half of those questioned said they’ve seen at least some made-up news about the pandemic. But seven in 10 said the news media are doing at least a somewhat good job in reporting on the outbreak. The poll, which was conducted March 10-16, also showed that nine in 10 Americans were closely paying attention to news reports about coronavirus and that seven in 10 said the outbreak poses a major threat to the nation’s economy.

"                          Coronavirus fears are hammering the U.S. airline industry, leading to a reduction in flights and the waiving of ticket change fees; William La Jeunesse has the details. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., issued a stark warning to any multinational companies looking to Congress to help them weather the economic downturn from the coronavirus outbreak: If you want taxpayer money, bring jobs back to the United States. Hawley delivered his warning via Twitter on Wednesday as the Trump administration pursues a $1 trillion stimulus package to aid Americans and an economy devastated by business closures and event cancellations and a concerted push for people to stay inside in the effort to curb infection rates. “To any multinational corporations that come to Congress asking for taxpayer $$$, you better come prepared to explain how you will move supply chains and jobs back to America if you want my vote,” Hawley tweeted.  The White House proposal includes $50 billion for lending to the airline industry, which has drastically reduced flights due to travel bans and social distancing. The proposal also calls for $150 billion to ""other severely distressed sectors of the U.S. economy"" through secured lending or loan guarantees, with Trump signaling that the hotel and cruise line industries along with airlines are “prime candidates” to receive the aid.  While an aid package to the airlines would be contingent on ""limits on increases in executive pay"" until the loans are repaid, many Americans want to see more radical changes to an industry critics say puts profit over travelers’ safety and comfort. “We cannot permit American and other airlines to use federal assistance, whether labeled a bailout or not, to weather the coronavirus crisis and then return to business as usual,” Tim Wu, a law professor at Columbia University, wrote in The New York Times. “Before providing any loan relief, tax breaks or cash transfers, we must demand that the airlines change how they treat their customers and employees and make basic changes in industry ownership structure.” Along with the money for major companies, the administration is also seeking $250 billion in payments to Americans starting April 6, followed by another $250 billion cash-payment round beginning May 18. The two payments to taxpayers would be identical and the amounts would vary by family income and size. Trump also wants $300 billion to help small businesses, which have suffered under social isolation and various cities banning dine-in services at bars and restaurants in an effort to prevent the spread. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE The draft of the plan outlines a major economic infusion that goes well beyond the stimulus and bailout plans during the last financial crisis and is designed to prop up an economy that has ground to a halt, as stores and restaurants and schools are shuttering nationwide and families are isolating at home. Congress and President Trump already approved an $8.3 billion package to prop up the health care system to respond to the pandemic. The Senate Wednesday was poised to send another bill to Trump's desk to give 14 paid sick days to workers, boost unemployment insurance, make coronavirus testing free and increase food assistance during the crisis. But all sides agree that the government must pass a third round of stimulus as soon as possible to help small businesses stay afloat, aid workers who have lost jobs and give the economy a jolt as American consumers nationwide are stuck home.

US NAVY HOSPITAL SHIPS TO BE DISPATCHED TO NYC 'IMMEDIATELY' AMID COVID-19 OUTBREAK, CUOMO SAYS “We think part of this is people heeded the early data coming out of China and coming out of South Korea that the elderly or those with preexisting medical conditions were at particular risk,” Birx said. “It may have been that the millennial generation, our largest generation, our future generation that will carry us through for the next multiple decades, there may be disproportional infections among that group.” She added: “So, even if it is a rare occurrence, it may be seen more frequently in that group and be evident now.” Birx went on to say that they have not yet seen “any significant mortality in children,” but said they are becoming increasingly “concerned about reports coming out of Italy and France.” “We need [millennials] to be healthy,” she continued. “I’m not only calling on you to heed what’s in the guidance, but to make sure that each and every one of you are protecting each other.” Birx added that millennials “cannot keep having these large gatherings that continue to occur throughout the country for people who are off work to then be socializing in large groups and spreading the virus.” “You have the potential, then, to spread it to someone who does have a condition that none of us knew about and cause them to have a disastrous outcome,” Birx said. Birx’s warnings came after multiple reports that Italy and France were seeing an influx of younger individuals falling seriously ill due to the COVID-19 infection. DR. FAUCI JOINS BARSTOOL SPORTS' 'PARDON MY TAKE' TO WARN YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT CORONAVIRUS Earlier Wednesday, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who is also on the White House coronavirus task force, joined Barstool Sports’ popular “Pardon My Take” sports podcast, to explain how young people “need to protect” the vulnerable. “The younger individuals, people who are the millennials, people who are otherwise young and healthy, generally, with some exceptions, you’re not completely exempt from risk,” Fauci said on the podcast Wednesday. “The problem is, we need the young people to help us to protect the vulnerable because, when an individual who is young gets infected, and either has no symptoms at all, or even mild symptoms, that individual will continue the virus spreading in the community,” Fauci said. “You might inadvertently, even though you feel that you are invulnerable… even if you are doing very well, you have to be a very important part of our national effort to contain the outbreak."" Fauci said young people are not “passive” when it comes to slowing down coronavirus. “You are an important part of the active plan to contain this epidemic,” Fauci said. “We really do need you, this isn’t something that can be successful without you.” Meanwhile, Birx also warned Americans that new studies are revealing that the novel coronavirus could be transmitted via “hard surfaces,” as well as human to human, and even fabric transmission and reminded that staying home is the best prevention. “This is all new science,” she said. As of mid-day Wednesday, the U.S. currently had more than 7,300 confirmed cases of coronavirus in all 50 states, including Washington, D.C. The U.S., so far, has seen 115 COVID-19-related deaths. The Trump administration’s coronavirus task force predicted Tuesday that the number of cases in the U.S. could peak in about 45 days. Fox News' Brian Flood contributed to this report.

This comes as the Trump administration is pitching a roughly $1 trillion stimulus plan.

"                          Fox News Decision Desk projects that former Vice President Joe Biden will decisively beat Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders in the delegate-rich states of Florida and Illinois. **Want FOX News Halftime Report in your inbox every day? Sign up here.**On the roster: A nominee all but certain, Dems still face deep doubts - Trump invokes Cold War powers to battle virus - One of the last pro-life Dems falls in primary - Humanity check    A NOMINEE ALL BUT CERTAIN, DEMS STILL FACE DEEP DOUBTS WaPo: “The Democratic presidential race passed a point of no return Tuesday, with former vice president Joe Biden firmly in control of his party’s nomination over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). But politics more broadly entered into the unknown as the spreading coronavirus continued to radically disrupt the political life of the country. This combination of certainty and uncertainty was highlighted on a day when three states — Arizona, Florida and Illinois — held primaries and another — Ohio — that was scheduled to do so abruptly shut down its polling places for reasons of health safety. Nothing better described a new normal than the rapidly changing face of American politics in the age of a pandemic. … The final primaries now could come only weeks before the Democratic National Convention is scheduled to convene in Milwaukee — if it is held as planned. Squabbles among state and local officials, some partisan and some territorial, highlighted the tensions facing all government leaders as they attempt to preserve the sacred process of voting amid fears that the traditional methods of casting ballots now endanger voters and poll workers alike.”Tuesday voter turnout maintained by early, mail voting - FiveThirtyEight: “The turnout drop may have been especially stark in Illinois because it is more reliant on in-person voting than Florida is. Indeed, both states saw an increase in the number of early or mail votes but a decrease in the number of in-person Election Day votes… Meanwhile, in Florida, 658,234 Democrats had returned their mail ballots as of Tuesday morning — already an increase of 27 percent from 2016. And 438,949 Florida Democrats voted early, which was up 19 percent from 2016. However, it looks like Democrats cast only about 500,000 votes on Election Day itself, which would be down 40 percent from 2016. Basically, the data from yesterday’s elections suggests that, in the face of the coronavirus threat, many voters simply traded voting in person for voting early or by mail. As long as the pandemic lingers, this could become a new normal for elections.”Time is on Sanders’ side - NYT: “The breadth of Mr. Biden’s advantage denies Mr. Sanders any realistic opportunity for a comeback. Perhaps Mr. Sanders will win a party-run primary or caucus… [But] without victories, Mr. Sanders will be deprived of opportunities to claim the momentum and favorable news coverage to change the trajectory of the race. … The likelihood of any potential game-changing event becomes likelier with time. By this measure, the new delays in the Democratic primary schedule as a result of the coronavirus slightly widen whatever narrow path might still exist for Mr. Sanders. He would have faced an even greater deficit if Ohio had voted on Tuesday as originally scheduled, based on results so far. … And Mr. Biden might have won an outright majority of delegates and wrapped up the nomination by late April. Now it is hard to say when he will clinch it.”DNC warns of delegate penalty to states delaying primaries past June 9 - The Guardian: “A new memo from the Democratic National Committee panel that handles delegate selection for the presidential nomination warns that states that hastily change the ‘first determining step’ of their own process could be subject to penalties – including a 50% reduction in delegates – if they hold primaries after a June cut-off date. The memo also says the panel is looking at ways to adjust how delegates are selected in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Three states will hold primaries on Tuesday. A fourth, Ohio, postponed its vote on Monday, due to Covid-19 and its drastic effect on public life. Louisiana, Kentucky, Georgia and Maryland have also postponed their votes. As in virtually every part of US society, election officials at every level have been discussing ways to safely administer elections without spreading the coronavirus. The new DNC memo, obtained by the Guardian, was sent to members of the rules and bylaws committee on Wednesday night.”Looking ahead to Georgia primary - AJC: “Joe Biden was poised for a big victory over Bernie Sanders in Georgia before the state’s presidential preference primary was postponed two months, according to an Atlanta Journal-Constitution survey released Tuesday that gave the former vice president a 44-point lead over his chief Democratic adversary. The former vice president led Sanders 66% to 22% in the poll released Tuesday, which showed only 11% of Georgia Democratic voters were undecided. The vote was delayed from March 24 to May 19 because of growing concerns about the coronavirus pandemic.”THE RULEBOOK: BY THE PEOPLE, OF THE PEOPLE“It is ESSENTIAL to such a government that it be derived from the great body of the society, not from an inconsiderable proportion, or a favored class of it; otherwise a handful of tyrannical nobles, exercising their oppressions by a delegation of their powers, might aspire to the rank of republicans, and claim for their government the honorable title of republic.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 39TIME OUT: PLAY (POK-TA-POK) BALLSmithsonian: “The ball game pok-ta-pok was nearly ubiquitous in pre-Hispanic Mesoamerica, but today, its origins remain a matter of debate among archaeologists. Though a version of the activity appears in the Maya creation myth, many modern researchers suspect it actually originated near the Gulf Coast. Now, however, a newly discovered pok-ta-pok court nestled in the highlands of Oaxaca, Mexico, is challenging that theory. The court, found at the Etlatongo archaeological site, dates to between 1400 and 1300 B.C., according to research published in the journal Science Advances. In use for about 175 years, the space is the second-oldest Mesoamerican ball court found to date—the oldest is located in Paso de la Amada and was built around 1650 B.C., reports Science magazine’s Lizzie Wade. The Etlatongo court dates to a pivotal period in the region’s history, when political and religious factions, trade, and a clear social hierarchy were starting to emerge.”Flag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARDESTIMATED DELEGATES FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATIONBiden: 1165Sanders: 880[Ed. note: 1,991 delegates needed to win]TRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE Average approval: 43.8 percentAverage disapproval: 51.8 percentNet Score: -8 percentChange from one week ago: ↑ 0.4 points[Average includes: NPR/PBS News/Marist: 43% approve - 50% disapprove; NBC News/WSJ: 46% approve - 51% disapprove; Gallup: 44% approve - 52% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 41% approve - 54% disapprove; CNN: 45% approve - 52% disapprove.]WANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT? You can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

The move gives the White House the authority to increase production of masks, ventilators and respirators, as well as expand hospital capacity to combat the coronavirus. He made the announcement at a press conference along members of the coronavirus pandemic task force. The U.S. has largely shuttered many aspects of daily life in order to stem the rapid onset of the virus, echoing efforts across the globe. As of Wednesday morning, there were 6,519 cases and 114 deaths in the United States.”Despite ‘shortcomings,’ Senate to pass coronavirus package - Politico: “The Senate is expected to pass a multi-billion dollar emergency aid package on Wednesday to confront the economic impacts of the coronavirus, as the Treasury Department calls for $250 billion in direct payments to Americans starting April 6. The Senate’s approval of the House-passed coronavirus bill paves the way for negotiations on a third, even larger stimulus package to address the pandemic. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reiterated his support Wednesday for the House package and vowed to address any ‘imperfections’ in the Senate’s subsequent bill — which McConnell promised to craft at ‘warp speed.’ … Despite ‘real shortcomings’ in the legislation, McConnell said, ‘in this case I do not believe we should let perfection be the enemy of something that will help even a subset of workers.’”Treasury lays out plan for cash pump - AP: “The Treasury Department said Wednesday it wants to start issuing direct payments to Americans by early next month as the centerpiece of a $1 trillion plan to stabilize the economy as the coronavirus epidemic threatens a body slam to taxpayers and businesses. In a memorandum, Treasury proposed two $250 billion cash infusions to individuals: A first set of checks issued starting April 6, with a second wave in mid-May. The amounts would depend on income and family size. The Treasury plan, which requires approval by Congress, also recommends $50 billion to stabilize the airlines, $150 billion to issue loan guarantees to other struggling sectors, and $300 billion to for small businesses. The plan appears to anticipate that some of the loans would not be repaid.”Dem super PAC to hit Trump over coronavirus response - WaPo: “A Democratic super PAC said Tuesday it would spend $5 million on digital advertising flaying President Trump for his response to the novel coronavirus, one of several groups that planned to devote resources to this type of messaging. The campaign from Pacronym — a political action committee affiliated with the nonprofit group Acronym — represents the first major pivot to coronavirus-related advertising fewer than 250 days from the election. It is a bet that the pandemic, which is also causing a deep economic downturn, will be the defining issue of the campaign. ‘This is a public health issue and a national security issue, but it’s also a public policy issue and thus a political one,’ said Tara McGowan, the founder and chief executive of Acronym, whose board includes veteran Democratic operatives like David Plouffe, who managed Barack Obama’s 2008 bid.”Trump unapologetically uses phrase ‘Chinese Virus’ - Fox News: “The war of words between the Trump administration and China over the origin of coronavirus has escalated as President Trump is going out of his way to call it the ‘Chinese Virus’ and China has embarked on a propaganda campaign to shift blame for the pandemic away from the Chinese Communist Party's handling of the crisis. The escalation comes as the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread in the United States, shutting down sporting events, restaurants, bars and elections across the country. ‘I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously,’ Trump tweeted Wednesday morning, commenting on news coverage about his response to the pandemic -- one of three Wednesday morning tweets referencing the ‘Chinese Virus.’ Minutes earlier he tweeted: ‘I will be having a news conference today to discuss very important news from the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] concerning the Chinese Virus!’”Trump has changed his tone on the virus - Politico: “President Donald Trump on Tuesday insisted that he had never underestimated or underappreciated the seriousness of coronavirus. But for two months he and some members of his administration downplayed the global threat even as world events and government and outside experts made clear that the health and economic impacts of this disease would be dire. Here are just some of those comments…”Yang isn’t pleased about the use of his signature issue - Politico: “Andrew Yang takes no pleasure in looking prophetical. The tech entrepreneur and former candidate for president, who last month suspended his campaign after poor showings in Iowa and New Hampshire, built his candidacy around the idea of universal basic income — that Americans should receive $1,000 each month from the government. The proposal was not so much panned as it was ignored… In response to the economic threat posed by the spread of COVID-19 … the Trump administration on Tuesday announced its intention to mail checks to Americans as quickly as possible. … ‘My phone is blowing up,’ [Yang] tweeted shortly after the White House briefing, an observation that has won 56,000 likes and counting. For all the congratulatory notes, however, Yang is deeply unsettled about the current crisis, no matter the role it might play in advancing his signature issue.”ONE OF THE LAST PRO-LIFE DEMS FALLS IN PRIMARY Reuters: “Liberal Democrat Marie Newman beat incumbent Dan Lipinski in a U.S. House of Representatives primary race in Illinois on Tuesday, according to news reports. It was a rematch for Lipinski, a long-time congressman, and Newman, a progressive businesswoman, who first faced off for the Chicago-area seat in a 2018 primary that Lipinski narrowly won. Lipinski, a member and past co-chair of the moderate ‘Blue Dog’ coalition who has served in the U.S. Congress since 2004, has been criticized by abortion rights and gay rights groups for his socially conservative views and faced blowback for voting against former Democratic President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act.

That means we have about 60 days of supply from the year before the day we start harvest to the next. Or clearer stated about 60 days’ supply till we run out of food. This includes all meats, dairy and plant-based proteins.  Like other essentials, because of the efficacy of the system, we have become complacent against events like Covid-19. One solution is to create a Strategic Food Reserve. We could take the next 10 years to build storage and supplies. This would solve two issues, 1) We can withstand future events with less disruptions. 2) Bolster the farm economy due to a demand market instead of supply.” – Jim Hain, Omaha, Neb.[Ed. note: I had never even thought about such a thing, Mr. Hain. I imagine there would be a lot of questions, as there were with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, about how much of what would go in how often. But given the likelihood of future supply chain disruptions, you may be on to something. Thank you for sharing it.]“In 2010 approximately 12,400 people died from the Swine flu in the US. No sports, restaurants, or other venues were shut down. We have about 100 deaths in the US from the coronavirus to date. Why is the coronavirus being treated so differently and why is there such panic? Does this mean in about two years when we have another new virus we’re going to have fear and panic and ruined economy all over again?” – Mike Wiater, Colorado Springs, Colo.[Ed. note: You are not alone in your resentment toward the scale of the response in this case, Mr. Wiater. Lots of Americans, including, until recently, the president, thought to minimize the dangers of the current crisis. But I urge you to read up on this subject and understand the unique threats this virus poses to Americans’ health and our way of life. The CDC’s resource page is very useful and will help you through the process. The rate of contagion and potential mortality rate here is quite concerning. Precautions that you take now will save lives, potentially including among friends, neighbors and loved ones. Now is the time for Americans to put their shoulders into this.]“What’s the point of ‘calling’ an electoral race unless it’s winner take all? Isn’t it all about the delegates?” – Chris Sales, Christchurch, New Zealand[Ed. note: Back when North Americans were still playing ice hockey, the NHL’s rules state that both teams in an overtime game get 1 point in the standings, while the winning team gets a total of 2 points. This may be a little like that. It’s true that Bernie Sanders won delegates in all three states that voted on Tuesday, but it’s also true that he did not win any of the states. When we project a winner before most of the votes have been counted it is a reflection, usually, of a decisive victory. Especially from a psychological and momentum stand point, that counts for a lot.]Share your color commentary: Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM and please make sure to include your name and hometown.HUMANITY CHECK UPI: “An anonymous customer at a Houston restaurant left staff a $9,400 tip just hours after the county announced mandatory business closings.

"                          President Trump announces developments on the war against the 'Chinese virus' including human trials for a vaccine are now underway The White House is moving forward with a proposed $1 trillion coronavirus package that would infuse Americans' bank accounts with two rounds of direct cash payments. The Trump administration is seeking $250 billion in payments to Americans starting April 6, followed by another $250 billion cash payment round beginning May 18, according to the working draft of the plan obtained by Fox Business Network. The two payments to taxpayers would be identical and the amounts would vary by family income and size, according to the Treasury Department document on the ""Stage Three"" coronavirus proposal. The Washington Post first reported the document. AOC AND ALLIED PROGRESSIVES SEEK MONTHLY CASH PAYMENTS, RENT 'SUSPENSION' IN CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE The draft of the plan outlines a major economic infusion that goes well beyond the stimulus and bailout plans during the last financial crisis and designed to prop up an economy that has ground to a halt as stores and restaurants and schools are shuttering nationwide and families are isolating at home. The Trump administration’s stimulus package is bigger than the 2008 bank bailout, and the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which was passed and signed under former President Barack Obama and totaled $787 billion to help stabilize the economy about 14 months after the last recession began. Congress and President Trump already approved an $8.3 billion package to prop up the health care system to respond to the pandemic. The Senate Wednesday is poised to send another bill to Trump's desk to give 14 paid sick days to workers, boost unemployment insurance, make coronavirus testing free and increase food assistance during the crisis. But all sides agree that the government must pass a third round of stimulus as soon as possible to help small businesses stay afloat, aid workers who have lost jobs and give the economy a jolt as American consumers nationwide are stuck home. TRUMP CALLS HIMSELF A ‘WARTIME PRESIDENT’ OVER CORONAVIRUS AS HE INVOKES DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT The administration's working plan amounts to $1 trillion on paper. It would provide $50 billion for lending to the airline industry, which has drastically reduced flights due to travel bans and social distancing. The proposal would require ""limits on increases in executive pay"" until the loans are repaid. The proposal calls for $150 billion to ""other severely distressed sectors of the U.S. economy"" through secured lending or loan guarantees. Trump signaled Wednesday that airlines, cruise ships and hotel industries are all ""prime candidates"" for support. The Trump administration also wants $300 billion to help small businesses, which have suffered under social isolation and various cities banning dine-in services at bars and restaurants in an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The administration would create a ""small business interruption loan program"" targeted at businesses with fewer than 500 employees that would cover six weeks of payroll. The amount for each employee's wages would be capped at $1,540 per week, or about $80,000 a year.

"                          President Trump announced he will invoke the Defense Production Act, which aims to better prepare the U.S. for the manufacturing and distribution of medical supplies amid coronavirus. President Trump announced on Wednesday that he will be invoking the Defense Production Act in an effort to help the private sector ramp-up manufacturing and distribution of emergency medical supplies and equipment amid the coronavirus pandemic. The act, which was first enacted in 1950 as a response to the Korean War and has since been re-invoked more than 50 times since, will streamline production of medical supplies to help the country battle the coronavirus pandemic and require businesses to sign contracts or fulfill orders deemed necessary for national defense. TRUMP ANNOUNCES HE IS INVOKING DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT TO FIGHT CORONAVIRUS “If we need to use it we’ll be using it,” Trump said. “It’s full speed ahead.” The act was periodically used during both the Korean War and throughout the Cold War, and was last invoked in June 2017 by Trump to provide technology in the space industrial base. Trump was not specific on the details of what the act would be used for – besides mentioning ventilators and masks – but below is a look at what the three main sections of the Defense Production Act: CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Along with the three main provisions, the act also provides the government with the authority to obtain information from businesses, authorizes establishment of the National Defense Executive Reserve, and a Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States – which works on the effects on national security of certain mergers, acquisitions, and takeovers related to foreign investment in the U.S. When the act is invoked it requires the administration to file an annual report to Congress on the impact of offsets on the defense preparedness, industrial competitiveness, employment, and trade from the act.

"                          Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tells Fox News that a plan will be done soon; Gillian Turner reports from the White House. President Trump on Wednesday announced that the Department of Housing and Urban Development will suspend all home foreclosures and evictions to the end of April amid the coronavirus outbreak. During a press conference from the White House briefing room on Wednesday, Trump said that he was working with HUD Secretary Ben Carson on the matter. SCHUMER SAYS US 'ALMOST CERTAINTLY' WILL SEE A RECESSION DUE TO CORONAVIRUS “HUD will suspend all foreclosures and evictions until the end of April,” Trump said. The announcement comes as the coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, outbreak rocks the markets and the economy. The president has said that a recession is possible, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., echoed the same concerns from the Senate floor Wednesday. “Even as the market shifts from day to day, coronavirus is slowing our economy to a near standstill and we’re almost certainly anticipating a recession,” Schumer said. On Wednesday, in the opening minutes of trading, U.S. equity markets plunged, removing all gains from earlier in the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,268 points, or 5.9 percent, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were lower by 5.4 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively. Trading is halted if the S&P 500 falls by 7 percent. The instability in the markets came as the Trump administration was negotiating with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to hammer out the details of a stimulus package that could reach $1 trillion to help U.S. businesses and taxpayers deal with the economic fallout. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, opening the Senate on Tuesday morning, promised swift action, though there is no clear timeline on when the Senate will vote on the package. ""The Senate will not adjourn until we have passed significant and bold new steps above and beyond what the House has passed to help our strong nation and our strong underlying economy weather this storm,"" McConnell said. TRUMP TELLS PEOPLE OUT OF WORK DUE TO CORONAVIRUS THAT MONEY WILL 'SOON BE COMING TO YOU' The Trump administration’s stimulus package is bigger than the 2008 bank bailout, and the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which was passed and signed under former President Barack Obama, and totaled $787 billion to help stabilize the economy about 14 months after the last recession began. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday that Trump wants him to send checks to Americans within “the next two weeks” in an effort to help people cope with the economic fallout due to the COVID-19 spread. Trump, on Wednesday, in an attempt to calm the thousands of Americans who have already applied for unemployment or have been furloughed due to the spread of the virus, said that “money will soon be coming to you.” “For the people that are now out of work because of the important and necessary containment policies, for instance the shutting down of hotels, bars and restaurants, money will soon be coming to you,” he tweeted Wednesday. The World Health Organization designated COVID-19 a global pandemic last week. As of Wednesday morning, there were more than 6,500 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States, in all 50 states, including Washington, D.C. The U.S., so far, has seen 115 coronavirus-related deaths.

"                          Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders addresses the changes being made to his campaign during the outbreak. As Sen. Bernie Sanders mulls whether to pull the plug on his White House bid, his presidential campaign on Wednesday paused investing any new money in Facebook ads. The move comes the morning after the progressive firebrand from Vermont was swept in Tuesday’s three Democratic presidential nomination primaries by Joe Biden. The former vice president’s overwhelming victory in Florida, his nearly 25-percentage-point defeat of Sanders in Illinois and his win in Arizona cemented his status as the presumptive Democratic nominee and all but shut the door to Sanders’ extremely narrow pathway to winning the nomination. SANDERS MULLS PULLING PLUG ON PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN  The pause in Facebook ads raised eyebrows – as former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg each stopped running Facebook ads in the hours before they ended their presidential runs. The news – first reported by Axios – sparked some incorrect rumors on Twitter that Sanders was suspending his campaign. Sanders communications director Mike Casca took to Twitter and put out an email statement to clear the record. “Good afternoon, everyone. The tweet about an Axios 'report' is wrong. He's not suspending. Nothing has changed since this morning's statement. Thanks,” Casca wrote in his email to reporters. At the Capitol, Sanders also personally denied he was dropping out. “There's not going to be an election for another three weeks. We are talking to our supporters. Anybody who suggests at this point we're ending our campaign is not telling the truth,” he told Fox News' Sally Persons. Earlier Wednesday, Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir explained in a statement to reporters: “The next primary contest is at least three weeks away. Sen. Sanders is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign.” In a subsequent email to supporters, Shakir acknowledged there’s “No sugarcoating it, last night did not go the way we wanted.”    ",         Sanders pauses Facebook ads as he weighs ending presidential campaign,         2020-03-18T123808-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/sanders-takes-pause-in-facebook-ads-as-he-weighs-ending-presidential-campaign,Fox
"                          West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin weighs in on coronavirus aid package and outbreak response. The Senate on Wednesday passed the House's coronavirus legislation to provide sick leave, unemployment help and free testing to Americans, sending the second COVID-19 relief bill to President Trump. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had criticized the legislation negotiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin as having ""real shortcomings"", but urged his members to ""gag and vote for it anyway"" to show bipartisan cooperation during the global pandemic. ""This is a time for urgent bipartisan action, and in this case, I do not believe we should let perfection be the enemy of something that will help even a subset of workers,"" McConnell said Wednesday morning in announcing he'd vote for the House legislation. The Senate passed the legislation in a 90-8 vote. The legislation that Trump is expected to sign into law would provide 14 days of paid sick days to workers affected by the coronavirus, ensure free testing to everyone, including the uninsured, and expand food aid and unemployment dollars to states. WHAT'S IN THE CORONAVIRUS BILL BEFORE CONGRESS Next up, the Senate and White House have been moving quickly to draft a third round of stimulus legislation that could infuse about $1 trillion into the U.S. economy that has been rattled by school closures, business shutdowns and steep declines in the travel and tourism industry as many Americans are stuck home. McConnell signaled Wednesday that Senate Republicans were close to an agreement on the next round of legislation that would help businesses, American workers, health-care professionals and others hard hit by the public health emergency. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SEEKS 2 ROUNDS OF CHECKS TO AMERICANS IN MASSIVE CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE ""Yeah, we’re working along and hoping to be together shortly,"" McConnell told reporters when asked whether Republicans were close on legislation. The House and Senate already passed a bipartisan $8.3 billion package to prop up the health-care system to prepare for the influx of sick Americans. The second response bill that passed Wednesday aims to bring relief to workers who lost their jobs and families at home for illnesses, quarantines or caring for kids whose schools have shuttered. Trump backed the plan that passed the House early Saturday morning with broad bipartisan support in a 363-40 vote. The legislation moved so hastily, bypassing the normal review processes, that the House had to make corrections to the bill language Monday. Earlier Wednesday, the Senate defeated amendments to the House legislation that were offered by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and a third by Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. Now, all eyes turn to the third round of stimulus that could infuse Americans' bank accounts with direct cash payments, an idea pushed by the far left and the White House. The Trump administration has been seeking $250 billion in payments to Americans starting April 6, followed by another $250 billion cash payment round beginning May 18, according to the working draft of the plan obtained by Fox Business. The two payments to taxpayers would be identical and the amounts would vary by family income and size, according to the Treasury Department document on the ""Stage Three"" coronavirus proposal. The Trump proposal would provide $50 billion for lending to the airline industry and another $150 billion to ""other severely distressed sectors of the U.S. economy"" through secured lending or loan guarantees. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Trump administration also signaled it wanted $300 billion to help small businesses, which have suffered under social isolation and various cities banning dine-in services at bars and restaurants in an effort to prevent the spread of the COVID-19.

"                          Former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld says he offers GOP voters a real economic conservative for president. Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld – the sole remaining GOP primary challenger against President Trump – ended his White House bid on Wednesday. The move by Weld to drop out of the race came the day after president formally clinched the nomination, as Trump topped the 1,276 delegates needed to be the Republican presidential standard-bearer once more. TRUMP SECURES 2020 GOP NOMINATION WITH PRIMARY VICTORIES “I hereby announce that I am suspending my candidacy for President of the United States, effective immediately,” Weld wrote in a statement obtained by Fox News. “I am immensely grateful to all the patriotic women and men who have stood with me during the past eleven months in our effort to bring better government to Washington, D.C.”       Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld - a 2020 GOP presidential primary challenger - files to place his name on New Hampshire's primary ballot - in Concord, NH in Nov. 2019.       Weld – a former two-term Republican governor who served at the Libertarian Party’s vice presidential nominee in 2016 – was a longtime vocal Trump critic.  In February of last year, as he took the first step towards launching a long-shot primary challenge against the president, Weld warned that “our country is in grave peril and I cannot sit quietly on the sidelines anymore.” And he slammed Trump, claiming “we have a president whose priorities are skewed toward promoting of himself rather than toward the good of the country.” Weld formally announced his candidacy in April and spent much of his time on the campaign trail in New Hampshire – which neighbors his home state and holds the first primary in the presidential calendar. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN With Trump extremely popular among Republicans, Weld repeatedly told Fox News and other news organizations that his plan to stay competitive would be to attract independent voters and even some Democrats to oppose Trump on the GOP presidential ballot. Bu the vast majority of independents opted to vote in the Democratic presidential primaries – where all the action was – leaving Weld with no shot of making a dent in the president’s renomination. Weld’s best primary finish was in the March 3 Vermont contest where he won 10 percent of the vote. He grabbed 9 percent in New Hampshire’s primary and in his home state, far below where he had hoped to finish. And while Trump’s captured 1,330 delegates to date, Weld only won one – in Iowa’s caucuses. Weld was joined in the GOP primary battle by former South Carolina governor and congressman Mark Sanford and by former Rep. Joe Walsh of Illinois, a conservative radio talk show host. Sanford ended his bid last autumn and Walsh dropped out after the Iowa caucuses. Weld, in his statement, said that “while I am suspending my candidacy, I want to be clear that I am not suspending my commitment to our nation and to the democratic institutions that set us apart.”    ",         Bill Weld suspends long-shot primary challenge against Trump,         2020-03-18T160125-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/bill-weld-suspends-long-shot-primary-challenge-against-trump,Fox

An unauthorized person somehow evaded U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) this morning to break into the Capitol building and smash a window on the second floor. While details of the break-in are scarce, the unnamed man was able to elude detection by police and gain access to the Capitol late yesterday evening or early Wednesday morning.  ""At approximately 8:10 a.m. today, an adult male was arrested by the United States Capitol Police for destruction of property on the west side of the U.S. Capitol.,"" USCP said in a statement. ""The incident continues to be under investigation, and additional charges may be forthcoming."" The suspect apparently got all the way to a balcony outside the second floor of the Capitol. There, the suspect allegedly broke a window onto the floor where the House chambers are and which looks out onto the National Mall.  CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW The window is near the House Republican Cloakroom and the main entrance to the House chamber -- the same door where the president walks into the chamber for the State of the Union.

The eight senators voting no were all Republicans: Sens. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, James Inhofe of Oklahoma, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, James Lankford of Oklahoma, Mike Lee of Utah, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Tim Scott of South Carolina. Critics said the mandate on small businesses to provide paid sick leave to workers was too much of a hardship when businesses are short on cash and can't wait for a federal tax credit reimbursement. “Small businesses in my state are closed,” Lankford said after the vote. “…Many small businesses are really struggling with how they're going to pay for this when they have no income coming in right now. They are hearing the promise of a federal reimbursement coming to them, but they don't know when that's coming and they're literally teetering on the edge right now.

"                          Power Line blog author Scott Johnson breaks down the story on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar unexpectedly praised President Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic on Wednesday night, saying it was ""incredible and the right response in this critical time."" Omar, normally a staunch critic of the White House who herself has repeatedly drawn the president's ire, went on to quote Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., as saying ""unprecedented times require unprecedented leadership"" -- and, Omar added, ""we are seeing that in our country right now."" ""Finally, we should never let politics get in the way of good policy,"" Omar concluded. ""This is a great start and hope others will be part of a united front to push for good policies that will help us work through the economic anxiety the country is feeling right now."" Omar was responding to a post by The Intercept's Lee Fang, who noted: ""Trump suspending mortgage foreclosures, demanding cash payments to Americans, now invoking the Defense Production Act to force private firms to produce needed supplies is incredible. Kind of a shell shock for anyone who reported on any economic policies in the Obama years."" Her praise for the president was matched this week by other Democrats and left-of-center commentators. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, on Tuesday, told reporters, “His team is on it. They’ve been responsive. ... I want to say thank you.” And, CNN's Dana Bash asserted that Trump's new tone on the coronavirus made him the ""kind of leader that people need."" On Wednesday, Trump invoked rarely used emergency powers to marshal critical medical supplies against the coronavirus pandemic. Trump tapped his authority under the 70-year-old Defense Production Act to give the government more power to steer production by private companies and try to overcome shortages in masks, ventilators and other supplies. TWO CONGRESSMEN TEST POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS Describing himself as a “wartime president” fighting an invisible enemy, the president also signed an aid package — which the Senate approved earlier Wednesday — that will guarantee sick leave to workers who fall ill. The Canada-U.S. border, the world's longest, was effectively closed, save for commerce and essential travel, while the administration pushed its plan to send relief checks to millions of Americans. Trump said he will expand the nation's diagnostic testing capacity and deploy a Navy hospital ship to New York City, which is rapidly becoming an epicenter of the pandemic, and another such ship to the West Coast. And the Housing and Urban Development Department will suspend foreclosures and evictions through April to help the growing number of Americans who face losing jobs and missing rent and mortgage payments. TRUMP SIGNS NEW CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE BILL -- WHAT'S IN IT? But as Trump laid out efforts to help the economy, markets plummeted. As reporters quizzed the White House as to whether the term ""Chinese virus"" is racist, or whether an unnamed White House staffer actually used the term ""Kung Flu,"" gone were thousands of jobs and nearly all the gains that the Dow Jones Industrial Average had made since Trump took office.

The vote was a lopsided 90-8 despite worries by many Republicans about a temporary new employer mandate to provide sick leave to workers who get COVID-19. The measure is also aimed at making tests for the virus-free. Meanwhile, the administration pushed forward its broad economic rescue plan, which proposes $500 billion in checks to millions of Americans, with the first checks to come April 6 if Congress approves.

That's an ""absolute total worst case scenario,"" Trump said. “We're no way near it."" The government has told Americans to avoid groups of more than 10 people and the elderly to stay home while a pointed reminder was given to millennials to follow the guidelines and avoid social gatherings. Trump likened the effort to the measures taken during World War II and said it would require national “sacrifice."" “It's a war,"" he said. ""I view it as a, in a sense, a wartime president. It's a very tough situation.” The White House has had several coronavirus-related health scares, with the president himself exposed to at least three people who later tested positive.

"                          White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow breaks down the coronavirus stimulus package and whats being done to help individuals and the economy during the outbreak. The White House is moving forward with a proposed $1 trillion coronavirus package that would infuse Americans' bank accounts with two rounds of direct cash payments. The Trump administration is seeking $250 billion in payments to Americans starting April 6, followed by another $250 billion cash payment round beginning May 18, according to the working draft of the plan obtained by Fox Business Network. The two payments to taxpayers would be identical and the amounts would vary by family income and size, according to the Treasury Department document on the ""Stage Three"" coronavirus proposal. The Washington Post first reported the document. AOC AND ALLIED PROGRESSIVES SEEK MONTHLY CASH PAYMENTS, RENT 'SUSPENSION' IN CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE The draft of the plan outlines a major economic infusion that goes well beyond the stimulus and bailout plans during the last financial crisis and designed to prop up an economy that has ground to a halt as stores and restaurants and schools are shuttering nationwide and families are isolating at home. The Trump administration’s stimulus package is bigger than the 2008 bank bailout, and the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which was passed and signed under former President Barack Obama and totaled $787 billion to help stabilize the economy about 14 months after the last recession began. Congress and President Trump already approved an $8.3 billion package to prop up the health care system to respond to the pandemic. The Senate Wednesday sent another bill to Trump's desk to give 14 paid sick days to workers, boost unemployment insurance, make coronavirus testing free and increase food assistance during the crisis; Trump signed it into law hours later. But, all sides have agreed that the government needed to pass a third round of stimulus as soon as possible to help small businesses stay afloat, aid workers who have lost jobs and give the economy a jolt as American consumers nationwide have been stuck home. TRUMP CALLS HIMSELF A ‘WARTIME PRESIDENT’ OVER CORONAVIRUS AS HE INVOKES DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT The administration's working plan amounts to $1 trillion on paper. It would provide $50 billion for lending to the airline industry, which has drastically reduced flights due to travel bans and social distancing. The proposal would require ""limits on increases in executive pay"" until the loans are repaid. The proposal calls for $150 billion to ""other severely distressed sectors of the U.S. economy"" through secured lending or loan guarantees. Trump signaled Wednesday that airlines, cruise ships and hotel industries are all ""prime candidates"" for support. The Trump administration also wants $300 billion to help small businesses, which have suffered under social isolation and various cities banning dine-in services at bars and restaurants in an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The administration would create a ""small business interruption loan program"" targeted at businesses with fewer than 500 employees that would cover six weeks of payroll. The amount for each employee's wages would be capped at $1,540 per week, or about $80,000 a year.

"                          'Fox News @ Night' anchor Shannon Bream delivers a 2020 update in 60 seconds on the biggest political stories. As Sen. Bernie Sanders takes time to “assess” his Democratic presidential nomination run after suffering more crushing setbacks in Tuesday’s primaries, Joe Biden’s campaign is spotlighting the former vice president’s “decisive” victories and illustrating how Vermont senator’s path to the nomination has all but closed. In a campaign memo widely distributed on Wednesday, Biden’s campaign touted that the former vice president topped Sanders by 39 percentage points in Florida and won every county in that state’s primary. SANDERS ASSESSES CAMPAIGN FUTURE AFTER TUESDAY'S SETBACKS TO BIDEN Biden’s landslide in Florida, his crushing defeat of Sanders in Illinois, and his win in Arizona cemented his status as the presumptive Democratic nominee and boosted his all-important convention delegate lead over Sanders to nearly 300. Deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield spotlighted that “Biden expanded his broad coalition to include new constituencies: Latinos, young voters, and more progressive parts of the Democratic party.” She contrasted the 2020 race with the two most recent contested Democratic presidential primaries.  “This primary is nowhere near as close as the 2008 and 2016 Democratic primaries. In 2016 Secretary Clinton did not open a 320+ delegate lead until the California primary on June 7, 2016. And at this point in 2008, President Obama had [about a] 100 delegate lead. Biden’s lead is three times that” Bedingfield noted. And pointing to progressive senator who’s making his second straight Democratic nomination bid, she emphasized, “In order to close the delegate deficit he faces, Senator Sanders would need to win every remaining contest by roughly 40 points.  That would require reaching 70 percent support, which is double his current national polling average of 35 percent.” Biden’s big lead in Georgia Sanders' campaign said the senator was heading back to his home state of Vermont later Wednesday – after the Senate voted on a massive coronavirus relief bill – to begin “holding conversations with supporters to get input and assess the path forward for our campaign.” A new poll in the state that was on deck in the primary calendar puts Biden ahead of Sanders by a three-to-one margin. According to a survey for the Atlanta Journal Constitution, Biden stood at 66 percent support among likely Democratic primary voters in Georgia, with Sanders at 22 percent. Georgia was scheduled to hold its primary next Tuesday, March 24. But  with the coronavirus pandemic spreading across the nation, officials postponed the contest for two months. Many of the states with upcoming primaries and caucuses are pushing back the dates of their contests – with other states very likely to follow. Biden vs. Trump poll position With Biden the all-but-certain presumptive nominee, a quick transition from the primary battle to a general election showdown with President Trump will likely soon occur. The most recent national polls conducted by live telephone operators indicate that Biden starts the race with Trump with the advantage. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll indicated Biden with a nine point advantage over the president – with CNN suggesting the former vice president holding a 10-point lead over Trump. But the race for the White House is not a national popular vote. If that were the case, then Hillary Clinton would be president. Instead, the presidential election is a battle for the states and their electoral votes. And a look at the latest live operator polling in some of the key battleground states spotlights a much closer contest. An NBC News/Marist poll in Ohio suggests Biden with a 49-45 percent edge. In Arizona, an NBC/Marist survey indicates the race basically deadlocked – with Biden at 47 percent support and the president at 46 percent. A Monmouth University poll in Arizona shows Biden with a slight 3 point lead. The latest poll in Michigan, from Monmouth University, puts Biden up over Trump 48-41 percent.  In 2016, Trump narrowly edged out Clinton in Michigan and two other reliably blue states – Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - boosting the GOP nominee into the White House. In Iowa, a Des Moines Register survey put Trump up by 10 points over Biden. New surveys in Virginia and North Carolina suggest Biden has the slight edge, while a new poll in Florida – the largest of the swing states – shows the president with a small advantage. Take all these polls with plenty of skepticism. It’s very early, the primary battle is technically not over, and the coronavirus outbreak will have a major impact – one way or another -- on public opinion in the race for the White House.

"                          Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Party of Wisconsin filed a lawsuit on Wednesday in the hopes of expanding voter access amid the coronavirus pandemic. The move by Democrats comes just weeks before the state is scheduled to hold its presidential primary and as concerns about voting mount during the COVID-19 outbreak.  “These steps are critical to ensuring that all Wisconsinites who wish to participate in the April 7 elections are able to do so,” DNC Chairman Tom Perez said in a statement. WHAT'S IN THE CORONAVIRUS BILL BEFORE CONGRESS Perez added: “Given the necessary measures taken by [Wisconsin] Governor Evers and public health officials in Wisconsin to limit the spread of the virus, it’s more important than ever that we expand access to voting, and increasing these necessary measures will help protect both public health and Wisconsinites' right to participate in our democracy.” The lawsuit aims to force election official in Wisconsin to extend the electronic and by-mail registration to April 3, suspend the requirement that copies of photo identification accompany absentee ballot requests and copies of proof of residency documents accompany voter registration requests.  The court filing also wants the state to extend its current deadline requiring absentee mail-in ballots to be received by 8 p.m. on Election Day to being postmarked by Election Day and received by municipal clerks’ offices within 10 days of the election. “Nobody should have to choose between exposure to COVID-19 and disenfranchisement,” Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Ben Wikler said. “The court should immediately strike down the barriers to full participation in voting by mail. Our democracy depends on our ability to conduct free, safe, and fair elections, no matter what—even during a pandemic.” Wisconsin – a key battleground state in this year’s presidential election – has been the focus of a number of lawsuits surrounding its voting process.  President Trump won the state by fewer than 23,000 votes in 2016, becoming the first Republican to win Wisconsin since 1984, after Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton infamously failed to campaign in the state. Democrats are trying to remedy their loss this election season by holding the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee this summer and aggressively targeting voters in the Badger State. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Earlier this month, a conservative law firm asked the Wisconsin Supreme Court to quickly overturn an appeals court ruling that stopped the purging of more than 200,000 people from the state's voter rolls, a move that Democrats argued was intended to make it more difficult for their voters to cast ballots. Moments after the filing, a conservative justice on the Supreme Court who previously sat out the case because he's on the ballot on April 7 said he would “rethink” that decision after the election. The court deadlocked 3-3 without Justice Dan Kelly's participation when asked to take the case earlier, so he could be a deciding vote. Wisconsin's presidential primary is April 7, but the appeal does not ask for the court to act in time for that election. A state appeals court last month overturned an Ozaukee County judge's ruling ordering the purge and dismissed the case, setting up this appeal. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

"                          The choices we make as individuals will collectively make a big difference to the pandemic, says Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. You had to keep scrolling down the home pages, whether it was the New York Times, Washington Post or some other outlet, to find out that Joe Biden had won three major primaries. The presidential campaign suddenly seemed ephemeral, a sidebar story, an afterthought. Even Biden’s brief victory speech, which focused mainly on the virus, had a weirdly disconnected vibe. It was a shaky livestream from Philadelphia, with no audience, and a delivery so low-key it was practically a golf whisper. TRUMP RAMPS UP AFTER DIRE REPORT, MEDIA ALSO GETTING LOW MARKS As the results came in showing landslide Biden wins over Bernie Sanders in Florida and Illinois, and by a narrower margin in Arizona, the cable news networks would dutifully report them -- almost with an “in other news” tone-- before switching back to virus coverage. And Ohio didn’t vote at all, with Gov. Mike DeWine postponing Tuesday’s primary at the last minute because of health concerns. With Maryland and Kentucky having joined Louisiana and Georgia in delaying their contents, the only major state voting between now and April 28 is Wisconsin, on April 7. In normal times, the press would be all over this race right now. Will Bernie drop out? Which woman will Biden pick as his running mate? Is he going too far to lure Sanders supporters? Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement yesterday that his boss in the coming weeks “is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign.” Beyond that, he said, the Vermont senator will remain focused on the government’s response to the virus. Biden, who won every county in Florida, is the obvious nominee. He needs to win just 46 percent of the remaining delegates for a majority, while Sanders needs 61 percent. I think Sanders was signaling that he’s going to hang around but not really run, as a way of keeping a sliver of the media spotlight and make his pitch for progressive causes. But he may have waved half a tattered white flag. (Axios had to retract a story saying Sanders was suspending his campaign.) But Biden is still courting Bernie’s supporters, saying Tuesday night that he and Sanders “may disagree on tactics, but we share a common vision” on health care, inequality and climate change. “I hear you. I know what’s at stake.” The former vice president of course needs Bernie’s diehards not to stay home, but the danger here is that he’ll move too far left for a general election. He’s trouncing Sanders, who shouldn’t be able to dictate the surrender terms.

He has previously worked in various leadership roles with the House Republican Conference and the Republican Study Committee and was the vice president of the conservative Heritage Action for America. ""Since joining OMB, Russ has overseen the delivery of four of the most conservative presidential budgets to date,"" Heritage Foundation President Kay C.

CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW TRUMP SIGNS 2ND CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE BILL HOURS AFTER SENATE PASSAGE Vought was confirmed to be the deputy director of the OMB in early 2018 by a razor-thin margin after Vice President Pence broke a 49-49 tie. The vote was strictly along party lines. Accusations of Islamophobia based on previous writings were largely what made Vought's confirmation so controversial. Vought, a Christian, wrote in an article defending a Christian school that fired a professor for saying Muslims and Christians worship the same God. He cited theologians in a lengthy piece, which at one point said that Muslims ""do not know God because they have rejected Jesus Christ his son, and they stand condemned."" ""Are you suggesting,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., asked Vought at a hearing, ""that all of those people stand condemned? What about Jews, do they stand condemned, too?"" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Vought countered, ""Senator, I am a Christian,"" and explained that his religion teaches respect for all ""regardless of their religious beliefs."" It is unclear when the Senate will take up Vought's nomination.

More members of Congress are now going into self-quarantine as a precaution after two fellow lawmakers tested positive for coronavirus. House Minority Whip Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., announced that he is going into quarantine after learning that Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, with whom he recently met, tested positive for COVID-19. REPS. MARIO DIAZ-BALART, BEN MCADAMS ARE FIRST LAWMAKERS TO ANNOUNCE TESTING POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS “Since I had an extended meeting with him late last week out of an abundance of caution, I have decided it would be best to self-quarantine based on the guidance of the Attending Physician of the United States Congress,” Scalise said in a statement, noting that he is “not experiencing any symptoms, and will continue working remotely on Congress’ Coronavirus response[.]” Diaz-Balart and Rep. Ben McAdams, D-Utah, are the first two members of Congress to announce they have been infected. McAdams told constituents of his status and his “mild cold-like symptoms” after learning his test results Wednesday. The Office of the Attending Physician sent a memo to all House members regarding lawmakers who tested positive. “My office has taken appropriate actions to identify any individuals who require additional monitoring for periods of quarantine,” said the memo from Dr. Brian Monahan, which was obtained by Fox News. “The office has adopted a very conservative guideline to identify individuals who may have come into contact with the ill Members during the pre-symptomatic period of March 13th. The office has additionally reviewed possible exposures among staff members and has assessed other areas involving the calendars of the affected individuals.” The memo went on to say that the attending physician’s office “identified the offices and locations that were found to be at risk and these have been treated by the Architect of the Capitol, using CDC approved cleaning methods to ensure there is no residual risk to others.” The memo went on to say that the attending physician’s office is focusing on situations where people had substantial contact with the infected congressmen. “Other instances where the affected Members may have briefly come into contact with other colleagues on the House Floor would be considered to be low risk exposures and no additional measures are required other than for them to report any illness should they become ill,” it said. Rep. Kathleen Rice, D-N.Y., then issued a statement late Wednesday night announcing her own self-quarantine. “I learned this evening that someone I was in contact with last Friday tested positive for COVID-19. After consultation with the Attending Physician and out of an abundance of caution for those around me, I will be self-quarantining until March 27th,” Rice said.

"                          President Trump signs Senate bill to guarantee sick leave for workers who fall ill during the coronavirus pandemic. Congress, a branch of the government not known for its ability to act quickly and certainly not known for coming to broad consensus on important issues, has done both of those things as it has shepherded two coronavirus-related spending bills to President Trump's desk in two weeks and is feverishly working to put together a third, blockbuster package that could be worth upward of $1 trillion. Trump's signing of the second coronavirus bill, which will provide $100 billion worth of paid sick leave, unemployment help and free virus testing to Americans, comes as the coronavirus pandemic is hitting close to home on Capitol Hill. On Wednesday, Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., and Ben McAdams, D-Utah, were the first two members of Congress to test positive for the disease officially known as COVID-19. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW TRUMP SIGNS 2ND CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE BILL HOURS AFTER SENATE PASSAGE ""I want everyone to know that I am feeling much better,"" Diaz-Balart said in a statement on his diagnosis. ""We must continue to work together to emerge stronger as a country during these trying times."" Congress is certainly working together. The Senate managed to pass the House coronavirus bill without amendments by a 90-8 margin, sending it to Trump's desk just two days after the House passed a technical fix to the legislation. The expedited passage of the House legislation was a stark departure from the usual interaction between the chambers. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the self-styled ""Grim Reaper"" for the House's ""socialist agenda,"" has been at odds with House Democrats since they took control of the lower chamber in early 2019.

And even before the Senate ushered through the second bill, members of Congress and the Trump administration were falling over each other to offer up ideas for another piece of legislation. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, and Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, each proposed different ideas for how the government could send checks directly to Americans who are financially strapped because of the economic slowdown. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., confirmed Tuesday on Sirius XM's ""The Michael Smerconish Program"" that a ""one-time distribution of $1,000 to every adult citizen"" was ""being seriously discussed."" CORONAVIRUS IN CONGRESS SENDS MORE LAWMAKERS INTO SELF-QUARANTINE, AS DOCTORS TRACK EXPOSURE Monday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced he would propose at least $750 billion in spending to fight the coronavirus crisis before it came out the next day that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin pitched Republican senators on $850 billion in spending for the same purpose. Then reports came out Wednesday that the third coronavirus package might actually be worth $1 trillion or more, as the administration urges two rounds of stimulus checks to Americans. McConnell Tuesday said he would break off Republican senators into task forces to write up parts of the GOP version of the third coronavirus response bill in coordination with the White House. ""This is a herculean task, from a legislative point of view, to try to craft something this significant with 53 people,"" McConnell said. ""Everyone has a way to funnel in their suggestions to one of these three task forces. These task forces will be working with the Treasury Department and Secretary Mnuchin and his team, to see if we can reach a Republican consensus so we know where we are."" He said he then plans to sit down with Schumer and work out the differences between the Republican proposal and the Democratic proposal before working to quickly pass the third-stage legislation. ILHAN OMAR PRAISES TRUMP'S 'INCREDIBLE' RESPONSE TO CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC In a Wednesday Dear Colleague letter to her Democratic members, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., prepared them for the third coronavirus bill, which she said would be focused on ""Unemployment Insurance, increased Medicaid funding and further assistance to small businesses. ""As we proceed with further legislation, we all see this tragic pandemic as a challenge for us to shape an economy that puts Families First,"" she wrote in the letter. She continued: ""The coronavirus pandemic has brought great pain to our country, but we must be hopeful that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Science has given us reason to be hopeful, and the best minds in America are working all hands on deck. Take pride in your support for our first bill, which allocated billions of dollars for research for treatments and a vaccine and in our second bill putting Families First, focusing on testing, testing, testing."" TYPICALLY PARTISAN SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS BECOME SOURCE OF CORONAVIRUS INFO AS PANDEMIC TRANSCENDS PARTISANSHIP Pelosi said in the letter she planned a Thursday conference call with her caucus.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Wednesday that it will temporarily halt some of its deportation efforts amid the coronavirus pandemic, except for those deemed a safety risk or under mandatory deportation order due to criminal history. The delay is intended to help mitigate the spread of the virus and to encourage people to seek testing and treatment, ICE said in a statement. “During the COVID-19 crisis, ICE will not carry out enforcement operations at or near health care facilities, such as hospitals, doctors’ offices, accredited health clinics, and emergent or urgent care facilities, except in the most extraordinary of circumstances,” the agency said. “Individuals should not avoid seeking medical care because they fear civil immigration enforcement.” Brandon Judd: Coronavirus pandemic requires US to adopt new policy to quickly deport illegal immigrants The statement added the agency would seek alternatives to detention but didn’t say what might happen to the approximately 37,000 current immigration detainees, The Washington Post reported. The agency said it would continue critical investigations into child exploitation, gangs, narcotics trafficking, human trafficking and terrorism. On Thursday, Acting Deputy Homeland Security Secretary Ken Cuccinelli clarified the statement in light of what he called ""widespread misreporting."" ""The health and safety of Americans is paramount. Thus, ICE will, as it has during other times of crisis, conduct enforcement operations that protect our communities and uphold our laws. This means that ICE will continue to prioritize arresting and removing criminal aliens and other aliens who pose a threat to public safety, just as it always has during President Trump’s administration,"" he said. ""That does not mean that no other removable aliens will in fact be removed, but during the current public health situation, removals will be done in such a way as to minimize the exposure of our agents and of the removable aliens we are encountering,"" he said. ""ICE will exercise its law enforcement authority in a manner that accounts for the dangers presented by COVID-19, while maintaining the safety and security of the communities it has sworn to protect.” Immigration advocates have urged ICE to release detainees who could be at a higher risk for contracting the virus due to cramped quarters, according to the Post. As of Tuesday, no detainees had yet tested positive for the virus. All immigration hearings have also been halted except for those already detained, according to The Post.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on Thursday urged President Trump to ""immediately"" wield his powers under the Defense Production Act to combat the coronavirus crisis, a day after he said he would invoke it but does not yet need to use the powers available to him. “The President must immediately use the powers of the Defense Production Act to mass produce and coordinate distribution of these critical supplies, before the need worsens and the shortages become even more dire,” the California Democrat said in a statement. “There is not a day to lose. We must put more testing, more protective equipment and more ventilators into the hands of our frontline workers immediately.” TRUMP ANNOUNCES HE IS INVOKING DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT TO FIGHT CORONAVIRUS Trump announced Wednesday that he was invoking the act, saying it “can do a lot of good things if we need it.” The act, which was first enacted in 1950 as a response to the Korean War and has since been re-invoked more than 50 times, would streamline production of medical supplies to help the country battle the coronavirus pandemic and require businesses to sign contracts or fulfill orders deemed necessary for national defense. It’s part of an expansive effort to combat the coronavirus pandemic that has shut down most of daily life in the U.S. in recent weeks. But he tweeted late Wednesday that he was only using it if deemed necessary ""in a worst case scenario."" TRUMP INVOKES DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT: WHAT IS IT? “I only signed the Defense Production Act to combat the Chinese Virus should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future,” he tweeted. “Hopefully there will be no need, but we are all in this TOGETHER!” For Pelosi and other Democrats, that need is already there. “Right now, shortages of critical medical and personal protective equipment are harming our ability to fight the coronavirus epidemic, endangering frontline workers and making it harder to care for those who fall ill,” she said.

Another attendee of last month’s Conservative Political Action Conference has tested positive for coronavirus, the D.C. government says. Earlier this week, District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser announced an updated count of individuals who tested positive for the disease caused by the virus, COVID-19, bringing the total in Washington to 31. CORONAVIRUS AT CPAC: DIAGNOSIS TRIGGERS SCRAMBLE TO TRACE EXPOSURE Bowser said Tuesday the new cases included one 23-year-old male. D.C.'s government said it is tracing the potential contact with others for all these cases but specifically noted the 23-year-old “Attended CPAC conference.” A spokesman for CPAC told Fox News they have reached out to D.C. health officials to try to track down any additional information. Meanwhile, Fox News has learned that the first infected CPAC attendee, who reports indicate is a New York City-based doctor, has left the hospital in New Jersey where he was being treated for COVID-19 and is now completing his recovery at home. A CPAC spokesman told Fox News Thursday that the organization has been in direct contact with that individual and his family to track his progress and recovery. The first case set off a behind-the-scenes scramble to identify who else the individual had been in contact with, prompting top Republican lawmakers to go into quarantine.

"                          A new government study is shedding more light on the properties of COVID-19; William La Jeunesse has the details. The Energy Department announced Thursday that it will purchase 77 million barrels of American-made crude oil to begin to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve amid the coronavirus outbreak. “DOE is moving quickly to support U.S. oil producers facing potentially catastrophic losses from the impacts of COVID-19 and the intentional disruption to world oil markets by foreign actors,” Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette said in a statement Thursday. GAS PRICES COULD HIT 99 CENTS IN SOME STATES DUE TO CORONAVIRUS AND SUPPLIES, EXPERT SAYS The Energy Department is expected to purchase an initial 30 million barrels of crude oil, with a focus on small to midsize U.S. oil producers. “The small to midsize oil producers, which are the focus of the initial crude oil purchase, employ thousands of Americans,” Under Secretary Mark Menezes said. “These businesses have been particularly hard hit by recent events but under President Trump’s leadership, we are taking swift action to assist hard hit producers and deliver strong returns to the taxpayer.” The department said that Thursday’s move is the first step in filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to its maximum capacity, and noted that they are working with Congress to “finalize the funding to support the purchase.” The move comes amid President Trump’s “whole of government” approach and public-private partnerships to combat the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States.

"                          Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard, member of the Hawaii National Guard, joins Shannon Bream on 'Fox News @ Night.' Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has suspended her long-shot campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. She made the announcement in a video posted to Twitter on Thursday. The move comes as former Vice President Joe Biden consolidates support in the party and builds a massive delegate lead over his only remaining rival in the primary race, Sen. Bernie Sanders. Gabbard, in the video, offered her ""full support"" to Biden. FIVE THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT TULSI GABBARD But Gabbard also praised Sanders. Gabbard, who backed the populist senator's 2016 White House bid, said: ""I have great appreciation for Senator Sanders' love for our country and the American people and his sincere desire to improve the lives of all Americans."" Gabbard – a four-term congresswoman who in 2012 became the first Hindu elected to Congress – launched her presidential campaign in January of last year. The Hawaii National Guard officer who served in the Iraq War advocated for a foreign policy that stressed that the U.S. stay out of overseas conflicts and entanglements.  But Gabbard was repeatedly criticized for her January 2017 trip to Syria – where she met with Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad and toured the city of Aleppo after it had been blasted to rubble by Assad’s regime. Gabbard’s anti-intervention stance was blasted by 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton – who referred to the congresswoman as “the favorite of the Russians” and suggested Gabbard was being groomed as a third-party candidate for the general election. Gabbard, saying she was defamed by Clinton, sued her in January for $100 million. Clinton has moved to dismiss the lawsuit. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN  The 38-year candidate – who was the second youngest contender in the race after former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg – also had to apologize early in her campaign for past anti-gay comments and actions. A decade and a half earlier, she actively promoted “traditional marriage” and several times referred to LGBTQ activists as “homosexual extremists.” Gabbard also repeatedly clashed with the Democratic National Committee over their presidential nomination debate criteria – which prevented the congresswoman and many of her rivals from making the stage. Earlier this month she was one of the first in Congress to push for universal basic income payments – made popular by former 2020 rival Andrew Yang – as a way to provide instant relief to Americans affected by the massive economic downturn caused by the coronavirus outbreak. GABBARD PUSHES UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME AS CORONAVIRUS ECONOMIC RELIEF Gabbard, who's said she won't run for re-election to her House seat, embraced the concept of universal basic income last year. In an apparent effort to try and attract Yang supporters, Gabbard said hours after Yang ended his bid in February that she would continue “to carry the torch” for his Freedom Dividend.       Democratic presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard joins supporters after filing to place her name on New Hampshire's presidential primary ballot, in Concord, NH in Nov. 2019.       The candidate spent much of her time early this year campaigning in New Hampshire – which holds the first primary in the White House race and votes second in the nominating calendar, after Iowa. Gabbard even rented a home in the state. But she finished a disappointing seventh place in the primary, winning only 3 percent of the vote. She barely registered in the Nevada caucuses and won just 1 percent of the vote in the South Carolina primary and in many of the Super Tuesday contests. But Gabbard stayed in the race – even after every candidate other than Biden and Sanders dropped out.  2020 PRIMARY RESULTS AND DELEGATE COUNT In the contests the past two weeks, Gabbard often won fewer votes than candidates who had already departed the race. In Tuesday’s primary in Florida, the congresswoman grabbed less than 1 percent of the vote, finishing behind former candidates Mike Bloomberg, Buttigieg, and Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. She won just two delegates in the nomination race – both coming from her native American Samoa.

The State Department is expected to soon advise against all international travel amid the global coronavirus pandemic, Fox News had learned. A U.S. official told Fox News on Thursday that the State Department will soon raise its global travel advisory to a Level 4, “Do Not Travel,” which is the most severe warning on State’s advisory scale. ENERGY DEPARTMENT BUYING MILLIONS OF BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL TO FILL STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE The State Department, before the outbreak of COVID-19 around the globe, had reserved Level 4 for Libya, North Korea, Afghanistan, Somalia, Syria, Burkina Faso, South Sudan, Yemen, Venezuela, Central African Republic, Mali, Iran, Iraq and Haiti. State also had designated parts of countries Level 4, like Sinaloa state in Mexico, due to cartel violence, or areas of southern and eastern Turkey due to terrorism and war. The move comes after the department had implemented a global Level 3 advisory over the weekend, which warned Americans to reconsider traveling abroad. The World Health Organization designated COVID-19 a global pandemic last week. TRUMP TO EXTEND EUROPEAN TRAVEL BAN TO INCLUDE UK, IRELAND AMID CORONAVIRUS  Following that designation, President Trump announced a temporary halt on air travel to the United States from Europe, initially excluding flights from the United Kingdom and those carrying cargo, in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. Trump then declared a national emergency over the outbreak and moved to ban travel from the U.K. as well. This week, the president and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also agreed to largely close the U.S.-Canada border to curb the spread of the virus.

Citing Chinese threats to disrupt the supply of pharmaceutical products the communist nation exports to the United States and plunge America into ""the mighty sea of coronavirus,"" Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Rep Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., introduced a bill Wednesday to cut U.S. reliance on pharmaceutical products coming from China. ""The Chinese Communist Party threatened to cut off America’s access to vital drugs in the midst of a pandemic caused by its own failures,"" Cotton said in a statement announcing the bill. ""It’s time to pull America’s supply chains for life-saving medicine out of China and make the CCP pay for contributing to this global emergency."" A release announcing the bill says it would task an FDA registry with tracking drug ingredients, ban the federal government from buying drugs with a supply chain that originates in China, require drugs to be labeled with the name of the country where they came from and provide benefits to manufacturers who make their drugs or medical equipment in the U.S. The bill would go into effect in 2022. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW TRUMP UNAPOLOGETICALLY USES PHRASE 'CHINESE VIRUS' AS CLASH ESCALATES WITH CHINA OVER ITS ORIGINS ""The Chinese Communist Party’s outrageous threats to withhold lifesaving drugs from the U.S. endangers public health and should open our eyes to our dangerous over-reliance on China in our medical supply chain,” Gallagher said. “This is a national security imperative that to many Americans, is a matter of life and death. It’s past time for us to develop an aggressive plan to move critical pharmaceutical supply chains away from China."" Currently, most drug components used in the United States are made internationally, and that supply is largely in China. The communist nation supplies between 80 percent and 90 percent of American antibiotics and 70 percent of acetaminophen used in the United States, according to Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. Cotton and Gallagher aren't the first members of Congress to introduce a bill aimed at bolstering the independence of America's medical supply chain. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., introduced such a bill alongside Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J. And Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., introduced his own version. But the Cotton and Gallagher bill comes as tensions between the U.S. and China have reached a fever pitch with leaders from both nations assigning blame for the coronavirus pandemic -- which originated in Wuhan, China and according to a study could have been reduced by 95 percent had Chinese authorities intervened just three weeks earlier -- to the other. RUBIO, GINGRICH: CORONAVIRUS LAYS BARE CHINA'S POWER OVER PUBLIC HEALTH, ECONOMY -- HERE'S WHAT MUST HAPPEN NOW President Trump tweeted four times about the ""Chinese Virus"" Wednesday while also doubling down on the terminology when asked whether it was racist during a press conference. ""Because it's from China. It's not racist at all, no. Not at all. It comes from China,"" Trump said. ""That's why. It comes from China. I want to be accurate.""

"                          Cities across the U.S. becoming ghost towns; many Americans without jobs as Coronavirus cases continue to rise. Acting Deputy Homeland Security Secretary Ken Cuccinelli on Thursday sought to clarify a statement from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that indicated it was halting most deportations due to the coronavirus outbreak -- with Cuccinelli pledging that deportations would still go ahead, but with increased safety precautions. “In light of widespread misreporting, clarification of ICE’s recent announcement about enforcement during the COVID-19 situation is needed,” Cuccinelli said in a statement. US IMMIGRATION OFFICES CLOSE UNTIL APRIL OVER CORONAVIRUS FEARS ICE said Wednesday that its enforcement and removal operations (ERO) would focus on “public safety risks and individuals subject to mandatory detention based on criminal grounds.” “For those individuals who do not fall into those categories, ERO will exercise discretion to delay enforcement actions until after the crisis or utilize alternatives to detention, as appropriate,” the statement said. The shift is in response to the coronavirus outbreak, which is highly contagious and led to government officials calling on Americans to practice social distancing and remain at home whenever possible. Activists who advocate for illegal immigrants had called on ICE to release detainees from immigration detention where possible to reduce the risk of spreading the virus in crowded areas. The ICE announcement was seen as an indication that most deportations would be delayed. It remains to be seen what percentage of removal operations could be put on hold due to the health emergency. But Cuccinelli, saying that “the health and safety of Americans is paramount,” promised that ICE will “conduct enforcement operations that protect our communities and uphold our laws.” “This means that ICE will continue to prioritize arresting and removing criminal aliens and other aliens who pose a threat to public safety, just as it always has during President Trump’s administration,” he said. He went on to say that, while those exceptions hold, some other removal operations will still continue with increased precautions to protect both agents and those being apprehended. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE “That does not mean that no other removable aliens will in fact be removed, but during the current public health situation, removals will be done in such a way as to minimize the exposure of our agents and of the removable aliens we are encountering,” he clarified. “ICE will exercise its law enforcement authority in a manner that accounts for the dangers presented by COVID-19, while maintaining the safety and security of the communities it has sworn to protect.” The announcement comes a day after  U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which deals mainly with legal immigration, announced that its offices across the country will close as part of the effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The suspension of services will last until at least April 1, although it will still process emergency requests. But asylum applications, naturalization ceremonies and other services will be postponed. The agency, which is the core agency dealing with most forms of legal immigration and asylum cases in the U.S., will send notices to immigrants and applicants affected by the delay, and interviews will be rescheduled, the agency said.

"                          President Trump says an old malaria drug called hydroxychloroquine has shown very encouraging early result against coronavirus President Trump announced Thursday that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is making experimental drugs -- including those used for treating malaria -- available as part of the ongoing effort to tackle the spread of the coronavirus. Trump announced at a White House press briefing that chloroquine, a drug designed for use in malaria, has been FDA approved and will be made available by prescription ""almost immediately.""

When asked about allegations his administration had been slow in responding to the crisis, he took issue with the premise of the question -- pointing to his order to restrict travel from China -- and said it could have been contained if only the Chinese government had done more. ""It could have been contained to that one area in China where it started,"" Trump said. ""And certainly the world is paying a big price for what they did.""

"                          Jonathan Hunt reports on efforts to recover an American Marine turned journalist who was kidnapped terrorists in Syria. President Trump on Thursday called on Syria to help secure the release of kidnapped journalist Austin Tice, who was taken hostage by jihadist militants in the war-torn nation almost eight years ago. During a news conference by the White House coronavirus task force, Trump implied that the regime of Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad was holding Tice and asked the country to release him on humanitarian grounds. “Syria, please work with us, and we would appreciate you letting him out,” Trump said. “We’ve done a lot for Syria and we have to see if they’re going to do this. It would be very much appreciated if they let Austin Tice out immediately.” FAMILY OF KIDNAPPED JOURNALIST AUSTIN TICE FIGHTS TO KEEP CASE ALIVE 7 YEARS AFTER KIDNAPPING: 'THIS IS A VIABLE MISSION' Trump said he could not confirm that Tice is alive, but he would like the journalist to be released from captivity if he is. ""If he is alive, we would like to get him back very quickly,"" Trump said. Tice, a former captain in the U.S. Marine Corps, had traveled to Syria as an independent journalist in May of 2012, before his final year at Georgetown Law School. The Texas native was covering events in Syria for McClatchy, The Washington Post and other news organizations when he disappeared just days after turning 31. About five weeks after his disappearance, a 43-second video emerged online showing him in the captivity of what his family described as an ""unusual group of apparent jihadists."" The men in the video have Tice bound and blindfolded. They chanted ""Allah-Akbar"" throughout the clip and at one point, forced him to recite a prayer in broken Arabic. Tice's mother, Debra, said last year that she's “reasonably hopeful” that her son might be found, but also expressed frustration at a senior administration official, who has allegedly been obstructing the effort. She also credited Trump for pushing harder than the Obama administration did to secure her son's release. FAMILY OF KIDNAPPED JOURNALIST AUSTIN TICE FIGHTS TO KEEP CASE ALIVE 7 YEARS AFTER KIDNAPPING: 'THIS IS A VISIBLE MISSION' “This administration is pressing it much more diligently than the previous administration,” she told McClatchy. “There is a deliberate, concerted effort to make this happen. I think it has not happened because somewhere at the senior level there’s some kind of obstruction,"" Debra Tice added. In June 2017, the New York Times reported that then-CIA Director and current Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had reached out to a Syrian government official in an effort to secure Tice's release. The backchannel shut down, however, after Syria launched a nerve gas attack on rebel-held territory in the northern part of the country. The Trump administration responded with a missile strike and negotiations fell through. In April 2018, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) offered a $1 million reward ""for information leading directly to the safe location, recovery, and return of"" the former Marine. Pompeo called upon the Syrian government to release Tice, and any other American hostages being held in Syria, back in September while addressing members of the media. ""The Trump administration never forgets about Americans wrongfully detained or held hostage abroad,"" he said. ""Among the more than 100,000 people who have been detained or disappeared in Assad's prisons is American journalist Austin Tice.

"                          Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says the economy is slowing to a standstill as COVID-19 spreads. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, joined by top Democratic senators, on Thursday rolled out a plan that would cancel student loan payments for the duration of the coronavirus national emergency and pay down some outstanding debt. Schumer, D-N.Y., joined by Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, unveiled their emergency student loan payment and relief plan, after floating measures to curb the economic impact of COVID-19. TRUMP SAYS HUD WILL SUSPEND ALL FORECLOSURES, EVICTIONS DURING CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK The plan would provide relief to federal student loan borrowers through an “immediate cancellation” of monthly student loan payments during the national emergency, and would “pay down a minimum of $10K for all federal student loan borrowers.” The plan would require Congress to authorize the Department of Education to make monthly student loan payments on behalf of borrowers, and would “guarantee” the minimum of $10,000 payoff for all borrowers. “The coronavirus outbreak brought with it crushing economic uncertainty, and students and borrowers need targeted, quick relief from payment burdens,” Schumer said in a statement Thursday. “Our new proposal would immediately cancel monthly payments, and give students and borrowers a minimum $10K student loan payoff. We must act now to help alleviate the growing financial strain on students and families across the country.” SCHUMER SAYS US 'ALMOST CERTAINLY' WILL SEE A RECESSION AMID COVID-19 PANDEMIC Warren, whose presidential campaign focused on cancellation of student loan debt, added that the measure would “fix the mistake that still holds back a generation of people and dragged down our economy.” The suspension of payments would be considered a new policy, separate from the deferment and forbearance options that currently exist for borrowers. The plan would also make all payments made by the Department of Education “tax-free” for borrowers. The proposal comes after President Trump, last week, announced that he had waived all interest on federal student loans during the coronavirus outbreak rocking the nation. Meanwhile, Trump on Wednesday signed the second coronavirus relief bill into law that provides paid sick leave, unemployment help and free testing to Americans. The legislation provides 14 days of paid sick days to workers affected by the coronavirus, ensures free testing to everyone, including the uninsured, and expands food aid and boosts unemployment dollars to states. Next up, the Senate and White House have been moving quickly to draft a third round of stimulus legislation that could infuse about $1 trillion into the U.S. economy that has been rattled by school shutdowns, business closures and steep declines in the travel and tourism industry as many Americans are stuck home. Schumer, Warren, Murray and Brown have included the student loan measure as part of Senate Democrats’ “Phase 3” stimulus proposal. Also expected to be included in the third stimulus package are the ""checks"" that the Trump and the White House have vowed Americans would soon receive. It is unclear, at this point, who would be eligible to receive the relief, and how much cash eligible individuals could expect. The House and Senate already passed a bipartisan $8.3 billion package to prop up the health-care system to prepare for the influx of sick Americans. The second response bill that was signed into law Wednesday aims to bring relief to workers who lost their jobs and families at home for illnesses, quarantines or caring for kids whose schools have shuttered. As of Thursday morning, the U.S. currently had more than 9,400 confirmed cases of coronavirus in all 50 states, including Washington, D.C. The U.S., so far, has seen 150 COVID-19-related deaths. The Trump administration’s task force predicted Tuesday that the number of cases in the U.S. could peak in about 45 days.

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., has called on “low-risk” inmates in federal prisons to be released from custody following reports that two prisoners in California are in quarantine after coming in contact with a person who tested positive for coronavirus.  Harris, a onetime Democratic presidential hopeful, sent a letter on Thursday to Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) Director Michael Carvajal arguing that the close quarters prisoners live in – paired with the strict measures the BOP is taking distance inmates from the public – makes them particularly susceptible to the COVID-19 virus. “In the midst of this crisis, BOP should be taking reasonable steps to reduce the incarcerated population and guard against potential exposure to coronavirus,” Harris said. “At this time, BOP—in coordination with the U.S. Department of Justice — can and should request the release of low-risk individuals who are in pretrial detention because of money bail.” TRUMP SIGNS 2ND CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE BILL HOURS AFTER SENATE PASSAGE Harris continued: “But instead, it appears that BOP is responding to the threat of coronavirus with extreme measures that both maintain current levels of incarceration and penalize the incarcerated community— including by suspending social and legal visitation, suspending inmate facility transfers, and potentially locking down institutions.” Harris’ letter comes shortly after a report in the San Jose Mercury News that two inmates in the Santa Clara County Jail have been quarantined after being interviewed by a defense attorney who tested positive for COVID-19. The infected person is reportedly an attorney with the county Public Defender’s Office.

While widespread outbreaks of coronavirus behind bars have yet to happen, the frenzy of legal activity underscores a crude reality that's only beginning to sink in: America's nearly 7,000 jails, prisons and correction facilities are an ideal breeding ground for the virus, as dangerous as nursing homes and cruise ships but far less sanitary. Stepped-up cleanings and a temporary halt to visitations at many lockups across the country in the midst of the crisis can't make up for the fact that ventilation behind bars is often poor, inmates sleep in close quarters and share a small number of bathrooms.

"                          Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden releases coronavirus plan, criticizes Trump administration's response; reaction from Chris Plante, syndicated radio host, and Ethan Bearman, host of 'Left Coast News.' For most of early 2019, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden — the declared custodian of liberalism who would continue the Obama glory years — seemed unstoppable. He led all other rivals for months. Biden seemed above the fray. Many Democrats saw the pre-debate and pre-election race for the nomination as more of a Biden coronation than a contest. In the summer and fall debates of 2019, Biden was occasionally confused about dates, places, names and facts. In public appearances, he often seemed grouchy or dazed. LESLIE MARSHALL: SANDERS SHOULD END CAMPAIGN – PRIMARY WINS SHOW BIDEN WILL BE DEM PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE Biden was once faulted for being too handsy in his interactions with women; now he was being criticized for losing his temper and insulting people during campaign stops. Biden dived in the polls. Democratic candidates such as Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Julian Castro, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren had all wounded the septuagenarian Biden, portraying him as too moderate and out of touch with contemporary green and diversity issues. Meanwhile, rival Bernie Sanders in the new year took over the lead in the polls. He focused on evil corporations, an unfair America and a rigged system. His populism drew crowds even as his socialism terrified the Democratic Party establishment. By early 2020, Sanders was feared to be unstoppable. Multibillionaire former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg jumped into the race with a storm of endorsements and paid ads. Bloomberg was supposed to save the Democratic Party from Sanders’ socialism in the wake of Biden’s implosion. Then the unanticipated happened. Sanders began praising Cuba and other Marxist countries, thereby confirming criticism that he really was too soft on communism. Bloomberg entered his first two debates and performed dismally. Almost overnight, he nullified his $500 million investment in a radio, television, social media and mailing campaign. But Biden just stayed Ol’ Joe Biden — occasional bewilderment, gaffes and all. As others sank in the polls, Biden seemed a known quantity in comparison. Other events lined up in Biden’s favor. The primaries headed to the South and West, where there were more moderate voters. On Super Tuesday, Biden was seen as less risky than Sanders and won a majority of delegates. Bloomberg dropped out of the race, as did Biden’s younger rivals — and most of them endorsed Biden. At no time did Biden cease his bloopers or embarrassing moments of forgetfulness and confusion. The field changed, not Biden himself. After Super Tuesday, Biden was, by process of elimination, suddenly the front-runner again in one of the more amazing comebacks in primary history. Democrats may have dodged the Sanders socialist bullet and united the party behind Biden, but how will Biden beat Trump? Biden’s threefold strategy is obvious. First, Biden will copy the Bloomberg playbook and avoid campaign appearances as much as possible, instead relying on ads, endorsements and the occasional short, teleprompter-aided speech. Biden also will name administration officials in advance and use a dozen or so of them as surrogates and anti-Trump attack dogs on the campaign trail. The subtext will be that the abstract idea of Biden is preferable to the concrete reality of hearing him speak or seeing him in action. Second, Biden’s running mate, with a wink and a nod, will be sold as the likely future president sooner than later. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Diversity candidates who did not run effective campaigns and dropped out of the race now have a chance to be revived as Biden’s running mate — with a real shot to be president or at least to have a more influential role than past vice presidents. Such a running mate could help Biden win over the base. And he or she could solve the Democratic Party’s embarrassing dilemma of damning white privilege while ending up with two elderly white men as finalists for the nomination. Third, no one knows the trajectory of the coronavirus, but the economic damage it is inflicting on the economy is already considerable. Democratic strategists are demagoguing it in a way that seems analogous to the freak storm Katrina, which wrecked the second term of George W.

CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP In 2020 we will hear a lot from candidate Biden — but less frequently will we see him in person, speaking to or mixing with crowds. His running mate will be advertised as the future of the Democratic Party, with the subtext of soon becoming president. And the 24/7 message won’t be collusion or impeachment, but the coronavirus. There are problems with all of these strategies.

"                          Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell provides updates on the coronavirus funding bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell signaled Thursday that the third phase of Congress’ coronavirus response plan would aim to deliver stimulus checks to the majority of Americans in a bid to provide relief to families under economic strain “as rapidly as possible.” McConnell, R-Ky., speaking on the floor, outlined the emerging Senate GOP proposal to provide “direct financial help” as the nation grapples with the COVID-19 global pandemic. MNUCHIN SAYS WH LOOKING TO SEND $1,000 CHECKS TO MOST AMERICANS WITHIN 3 WEEKS  “Senate Republicans want to put cash in the hands of the American people,” McConnell said Thursday, noting that lawmakers are currently finalizing a structure that can quickly send assistance to Americans. An outstanding question has been whether the aid would be restricted based on income and work status. McConnell indicated job status would not be a factor, and that the money would go to unemployed workers and those recently laid off; those still working; and retirees, even if they're already receiving Social Security checks. While officials have indicated the ultra-rich would not be eligible, McConnell said Thursday the checks would still go to everybody ""from the middle class on down. Period."" How the middle class is defined can be a contentious subject when stimulus checks are on the line. One source told Fox Business Network that the amount would start to reduce for those making $75,000 and above -- and the checks would be limited to those who make $99,000 or less. “This is something we want to do right away,” McConnell said on the floor. “This is not an ordinary policy, but this is not an ordinary time.” He added: “The American people need help and they need it fast. This will deliver it.” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday morning told Fox Business Network that the White House is looking at payments of $1,000 to most adult Americans within three weeks, and an additional $500 for children. A family of four would receive as much as $3,000. Mnuchin also said that if the crisis were still ongoing in six weeks, the federal government would deliver another round of checks worth the same amount of money. But sources familiar with the negotiations between Congress and the Treasury Department later told FBN on Thursday that the Senate is now looking to deliver more than that per person. Sources said that senators are weighing delivering $1,200 per adult in the U.S. in two payments, and an additional $500 for children. Negotiations, though, are ongoing. SENATE DEMS PROPOSE SUSPENDING FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS AMID CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK Mnuchin said earlier this week that it was “clear we don’t need to send people who make a million dollars a year checks.” Meanwhile, McConnell’s new proposal also includes relief and support for small businesses, and would provide “new federally guaranteed loans” that he said would “address immediate cash flow problems.” McConnell also said that the Senate was working to let “qualified” small businesses get liquidity through “familiar institutions” like their community banks. He added that the relief for small businesses would help them to “endure, help workers keep their jobs, and businesses and workers emerge from this ready to thrive.” The Senate is also looking at implementing “targeted lending” to industries of national importance, like the airline industry. “We’re not talking about so-called bailouts for firms that made reckless decisions,” McConnell said, referencing the 2008 financial crisis. “No one is alleging a moral hazard here.” “None of these firms, not corner stores, pizza parlors, not airlines, brought this on themselves,"" he continued. “We’re not talking about a taxpayer-funded cushion for companies that made mistakes. We’re talking about loans that must be repaid.” McConnell also said the new proposal would give more resources to those in the medical field and healthcare industry, and would “remove barriers to care, speed innovation, fund hospitals and health centers to treat patients and expand health care workers access to the tools they need.” Meanwhile, President Trump on Wednesday signed the second coronavirus relief bill into law that provides paid sick leave, unemployment help and free testing to Americans. The legislation provides 14 days of paid sick days to workers affected by the coronavirus, ensures free testing to everyone, including the uninsured, and expands food aid and boosts unemployment dollars to states. The House and Senate already passed a bipartisan $8.3 billion package to prop up the health care system to prepare for the influx of sick Americans. The second response bill that was signed into law Wednesday aims to bring relief to workers who lost their jobs and families at home for illnesses, quarantines or caring for kids whose schools have shuttered. As of Thursday afternoon, the U.S. had more than 10,700 confirmed cases of coronavirus in all 50 states, including Washington, D.C. The U.S., so far, has seen 154 COVID-19-related deaths. The Trump administration’s task force predicted Tuesday that the number of cases in the U.S. could peak in about 45 days.

"                          Senator Chris Coons comments on the two members of Congress who tested positive for coronavirus and how Congress is functioning remotely Members of both the House of Representatives and the Senate are pushing to allow Congress to vote remotely as leaders work feverishly to hash out an agreement for a massive coronavirus relief bill and after two colleagues tested positive for the novel coronavirus Wednesday. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, on Thursday introduced a resolution to amend the chamber's rules to allow for remote voting in emergencies. Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., also said in a letter to Democratic members that he expected the House to ""adjust our voting procedures"" in order to follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations limiting the number of people in any one gathering. ""I joined with Sen. Portman of Ohio in proposing that we take into consideration the fact that we have critically important work to do in the Senate,"" Durbin said in floor remarks Thursday. ""But gathering in groups, as we've done historically, poses a health risk not just to us as members and our families, but to the staff as well as their families."" CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW TRUMP ANNOUNCES FDA MAKING ANTI-MALARIA DRUG AVAILABLE 'ALMOST IMMEDIATELY' TO TACKLE CORONAVIRUS He continued: ""Why is it required that we be physically present on the floor closer to one another than perhaps we should be at this moment of a public health crisis?"" The resolution introduced by Portman and Durbin would allow the Senate majority leader and the minority leader – currently Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. – to agree to allow ""secure remote voting"" in an emergency. The Senate would then be able to vote every 30 days to continue to allow remote voting. ""In times of a national emergency, the Senate must be able to convene and act expeditiously even if we can’t be together in person,"" Portman said in a statement. ""While I know there is resistance to changing a Senate tradition to allow for remote voting during national emergencies, I believe this is an important issue and worthy of robust discussion among our Senate colleagues."" Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., and Rep. Ben McAdams, D-Utah, on Wednesday were the first two members of Congress to announce they tested positive. CHINA RECASTS ITSELF AS GLOBAL CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE LEADER AS US, EU STRUGGLE McConnell, an old-fashioned Senate parliamentarian, panned the idea of remote voting Tuesday, saying he would work to keep senators from spreading the coronavirus among each other ""without fundamentally changing Senate rules."" The Senate majority leader said one of the ways this could be accomplished is by extending the amount of time each vote lasts, thus allowing senators to space out their time in the chamber and maintain social distancing. It is also unclear how ""secure"" remote voting from members of Congress would work under Durbin and Portman's proposal. In floor remarks Thursday, Portman also cited constitutional concerns as a reason why he thought the Senate should allow for remote voting. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""It's important to me, and I think to all of my colleagues, that Article I be heard, that the legislative branch be heard, that we have the ability to convene for the continuity of government and not allow what we would normally do perhaps to shift over ... to the executive branch or not to be addressed at all,"" he said. Durbin, citing evolving national security threats worldwide, said it may be inevitable that the Senate figure out a way to have members vote remotely. ""We live in an age where national emergencies, public health crises and terrorism can threaten the ordinary course of Senate business,"" he said in a statement. ""We need to bring voting in the Senate into the 21st century so that our important work can continue even under extraordinary circumstances. Bob Dylan was right: ‘the times they are a-changin'.'""

"                          Shelter-in-place restrictions are rapidly expanding in California, affecting over 10 million residents; Claudia Cowan reports from San Francisco. The coronavirus outbreak has resulted in federal, state and local officials declaring a state of emergency, which allows them to wield additional powers in an effort to protect residents and curb the severity of the outbreak. The result has been varying degrees of life-disrupting events such as quarantines, shuttered businesses and school closures -- which raises a multitude of questions about what the government legally can and cannot do. GOV. DESANTIS TO FLORIDA SPRING BREAKERS: 'THE PARTY'S OVER' Federal emergency powers The federal government is relatively limited in what it can do to control people’s daily lives, as “police power” such as measures aimed at promoting public safety is generally reserved for the states. What Washington can do is impose certain travel restrictions and border protections and issue warnings to avoid travel to certain areas. The Secretary of Health and Human Services also has the ability to declare a Public Health Emergency, which Secretary Alex Azar has done. In the case of a PHE, the government takes on powers related to “making grants; entering into contracts; and conducting and supporting investigations into the cause, treatment, or prevention of the disease or disorder,” according to an HHS website for Public Health Emergency. States of emergency last for the duration of the emergency or 90 days, and can be extended by the secretary. Congress needs to be notified within 48 hours of a declaration, and other agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security, Justice Department and the FBI have to be kept informed. 'THE VIEW' HOSTS DEFEND TRUMP'S DESCRIPTION OF HIMSELF AS A 'WARTIME' PRESIDENT DURING PANDEMIC The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) can also take certain steps under the Public Health Services Act. This includes imposing quarantines, like they did in the case of 200 people who were evacuated from Wuhan, China, and others who had been on cruise ships. The CDC can also isolate and examine individuals who they suspect or know to be infected. As Arizona State University Law professor James G. Hodge, Jr., wrote for the Network for Public Health Law, while the federal government can quarantine individuals or groups suspected of being infected by coronavirus, they cannot enforce broad lockdowns of groups in “hot zones.” The government can make medical triage decisions based on scientific recommendations, but not based on factors such as race, religion, nationality, or ability to pay. Even individuals cannot be isolated without confirmation of infections. Individuals also have due process rights, meaning they cannot be subjected to forced treatment. President Trump has also invoked two laws that enhance the federal government’s ability to respond to the crisis. The Stafford Act allows the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to utilize government programs to provide assistance to local governments. The Defense Production Act, which Trump said he has invoked in case of ""a worst case scenario,"" requires companies to accept and prioritize contracts from the government and to prioritize “materials, services, and facilities to promote the national defense or to maximize domestic energy supplies.” While this provision has historically been used to ramp up military production, in the midst of the COVID19 pandemic the act will be used for medical supplies. One thing that the president cannot do is delay November’s presidential election. While numerous states have laws allowing them to put off their own elections, and Congress reserves the power to change the time of a federal election, the executive branch has no say over these matters. States and local actions Going back to states’ police power, this is the basis for measures currently being taken in places like New York and California, where daily life has been dramatically altered. Governors can impose restrictions statewide, while mayors have the ability to put in place additional measures at the local level. San Francisco, for example, has imposed a “shelter in place” lockdown, meaning people must remain at home except for tasks such as grocery shopping, getting medical treatment, caring for other people, and exercising. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has said he is considering imposing similar restrictions, although Gov. Andrew Cuomo stated Thursday that there is currently no plan for this to happen. He did, however, call for 75 percent of the ""nonessential"" workforce to work from home. New York City has already seen the closures of establishments such as concert venues and bars that do not serve food, with restaurants restricted to takeout and delivery only -- restrictions being imposed in jurisdictions across the country. This was followed by restrictions across the tri-state area of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, which include 8 p.m. curfews, and the closure of all schools, gyms, movie theaters, and casinos. This does not count those run by Native American tribes, although the Oneida Indian Nation stated they would be closing casinos. Additional restrictions that New York law permits in a state of emergency include “the suspension or limitation of the sale, dispensing, use or transportation of alcoholic beverages, firearms, explosives, and flammable materials and liquids” and the establishment of emergency shelters and medical shelters. EATING TAKEOUT AND DINING IN: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW DURING THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC California has also closed bars and nightclubs in the state. Like New York, the states of Massachusetts, Ohio and Illinois have limited bars and restaurants to takeout and delivery only. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker has also restricted gatherings to only permit those of 25 people or less. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot ordered Thursday that all sick people remain home. Texas also declared a shutdown that will close bars, restaurants, gyms and schools from Friday until April 1. Florida also saw a range of responses from state and local officials. Cocoa Beach Mayor Ben Malik announced that the city would be shutting down parking to dissuade people from going to the beach. On Thursday, Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez announced that all parks and beaches in the county will be closed. Since then, Gov. Ron DeSantis said on “Fox & Friends” that “the party’s over in Florida” for spring breakers who were still looking to party at the shore despite the outbreak, and beaches will either close or abide by federal guidelines limiting crowds. Enforcement and limitations Enforcement and penalties for violating restrictions can vary significantly from state to state. According to a survey by Law & Crime’s Aaron Keller and Elura Nanos, violations of quarantines in New Jersey and Montana can be punished by fines of between $10 and $100. In Mississippi, someone who “knowingly and willfully violates” a quarantine order can be fined up to $5,000 and be imprisoned for up to five years. Despite their broad authorities, there are limitations on prohibitions states can put in place. In New York, a state of emergency only lasts for 30 days or until the proclamation is rescinded, whichever is sooner. A state of emergency can, however, be extended by additional 30-day periods. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In California, emergency regulations remain in effect for 180 days, unless the state’s Office of Administrative Law approves a readoption, which can only be done twice, and each readoption period is just 90 days.

"                          The number of people testing positive for coronavirus has spiked after testing has become more readily available in the U.S. President Trump and Gov. Cuomo are just two officials considering how to address this issue. Kansas GOP lawmakers on Wednesday moved to limit their Democratic governor’s emergency powers during the coronavirus pandemic, arguing that they are an overreaction that is fueling panic and an unnecessary intrusion into people’s lives.  The pushback came after Gov. Laura Kelly announced Tuesday that all public schools will be closed for the remainder of the school year and classes will be held remotely to curb the spread of the coronavirus.        Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly answers questions from reporters after announcing that she'd order all public and private K-12 schools in the state to close for the rest of the semester, Tuesday, March 17, 2020, at the Statehouse in Topeka, Kan.      (AP) Conservative critics have suggested that Kelly's actions suggest she might go after firearms and try to limit their sale. Kelly declared a state of emergency last week to mobilize state resources, but it will expire March 27 unless legislators pass a resolution extending it. Lawmakers are now set to have the GOP-controlled legislature's leaders scrutinize all of Kelly's future coronavirus orders and to give them the power to revoke many of them within days.  ""There is a concern about civil liberties, a concern about the proper exercise of government authority and not wanting it to be too extreme,” House Speaker Pro Tem. Blaine Finch, who helped draft the final version, told fellow Republicans. The House approved a version of the resolution last week as a straightforward extension of Kelly's state of emergency into January 2021.  CURFEWS, CLOSURES AND MORE: WHAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN AND CAN'T DO IN A HEALTH EMERGENCY The Senate on Wednesday passed its version limiting Kelly's power, 37-2. The two chambers then negotiated a compromise Wednesday night, with final votes in both chambers expected later Thursday. The state of emergency would last until May 1, but legislative leaders could approve further extensions every 30 days. The Senate-approved language from conservatives to strip Kelly of power governors have had in other emergencies. Among those powers is the authority to say who goes into or out of a disaster area and to restrict movement within an area. She also would lose the governor's broad power to act to ""promote and secure the safety and protection of the civilian population."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Conservatives argued that Kelly's bold moves, and similar actions in other states, are unnecessarily torpedoing the economy and isolating people.  Democrats warned that the Senate's language could limit Kelly's ability to set up quarantine zones around communities in crisis.

"                          Schools close, sports leagues suspend or delay their seasons and large public gatherings are limited in response to the coronavirus pandemic; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' The State Department advised United States citizens on Thursday to avoid all international travel due to the outbreak of coronavirus around the globe, urging Americans abroad to arrange for an “immediate return” to the U.S. unless they plan to stay out of the country for “an indefinite period.” Fox News reported early Thursday that the State Department would raise its global travel advisory to a Level 4, “Do Not Travel,” which is the most severe warning on State’s advisory scale. The department made it official later in the afternoon. “The Department of State advises U.S. citizens to avoid all international travel due to the global impact of COVID-19,” the State Department said in a statement. “In countries where commercial departure options remain available, U.S. citizens who live in the United States should arrange for immediate return to the United States, unless they are prepared to remain abroad for an indefinite period.” The State Department also warned that U.S. citizens living abroad “should avoid all international travel.” “Many countries are experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks and implementing travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines, closing borders, and prohibiting non-citizens from entry with little advance notice,” the State Department said. “Airlines have cancelled many international flights and several cruise operators have suspended operations or cancelled trips.” The department added: “If you choose to travel internationally, your travel plans may be severely disrupted, and you may be forced to remain outside of the United States for an indefinite timeframe.” ENERGY DEPARTMENT BUYING MILLIONS OF BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL TO FILL STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE The State Department, before the outbreak of COVID-19 around the globe, had reserved Level 4 for Libya, North Korea, Afghanistan, Somalia, Syria, Burkina Faso, South Sudan, Yemen, Venezuela, Central African Republic, Mali, Iran, Iraq and Haiti. State also had designated parts of countries Level 4, like Sinaloa state in Mexico, due to cartel violence, or areas of southern and eastern Turkey due to terrorism and war. The move comes after the department had implemented a global Level 3 advisory over the weekend, which warned Americans to reconsider traveling abroad. Last week, the State Department authorized the departure of U.S. personnel and family members from any diplomatic or consular post in the world who ""have determined they are at higher risk of a poor outcome if exposed to COVID-19 or who have requested departure based on a commensurate justification.""  The department said Thursday that ""these departures may limit the ability of U.S. Embassies and consulates to provide services to U.S. citizens."" The World Health Organization designated COVID-19 a global pandemic last week. TRUMP TO EXTEND EUROPEAN TRAVEL BAN TO INCLUDE UK, IRELAND AMID CORONAVIRUS  Following that designation, President Trump announced a temporary halt on air travel to the United States from Europe, initially excluding flights from the United Kingdom and those carrying cargo, in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. Trump then declared a national emergency over the outbreak and moved to ban travel from the U.K. as well. This week, the president and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also agreed to largely close the U.S.-Canada border to curb the spread of the virus. As of Thursday, the U.S. currently has 11,274 confirmed cases of coronavirus in all 50 states, including Washington, D.C. The U.S., so far, has seen 157 COVID-19-related deaths. The Trump administration’s task force predicted Tuesday that the number of cases in the U.S. could peak in about 45 days.

"                          California’s over 151,000 homeless people are being moved into hotels to prevent the spread of the coronavirus on the street. California Gov. Gavin Newsom authorized on Wednesday the spending of $150 million in emergency funding to protect homeless individuals amid the coronavirus pandemic. Newsom, a Democrat, directed that $100 million will go to local governments for shelter support and emergency housing, while the remaining money will be used to buy trailers and lease hotel and motel rooms to serve as quarantine sites for any homeless individuals who have become infected with the contagion. “People experiencing homelessness are among the most vulnerable to the spread of COVID-19,” Newsom said. “California is deploying massive resources to get these vulnerable residents safely into shelter, removing regulatory barriers and securing trailers and hotels to provide immediate housing options for those most at risk."" He added: “Helping these residents is critical to protecting public health, flattening the curve and slowing the spread of COVID-19.” PHOTOS: EMPTY STREETS AMID CORONAVIRUS FEARS IN US CITIES Along with the allocation of millions of dollars, the state has also permitted local municipalities to freely spend money allocated to battle homelessness on combating the spread of the virus among the community, ramped up public health outreach among the homeless, and opened two hotels it has leased to house homeless individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19. California is home to half of the country’s street homeless population – and more than one-fifth of the reported cases of coronavirus nationwide so far – and state and local lawmakers have already thrown billions of dollars trying to tackle the mounting issue of homelessness. The coronavirus pandemic adds another – possibly deadly – angle to the issue. The stress and physical toll of living on the streets paired with the poor sanitary conditions faced by the homeless make them particularly susceptible to diseases and viruses. In addition, many homeless people deal with mental health and substance abuse issues and are generally wary of local authorities, meaning they are hesitant to seek help when they do get sick.

Sign up here.**On the roster: Some political coronavirus questions to consider - I’ll Tell You What: Bernie double or nothing - Pelosi holds tight grip on next stimulus plan - Trump to have call with nation’s governors - To your health SOME POLITICAL CORONAVIRUS QUESTIONS TO CONSIDERMaybe first of all, we should remember that it’s only been a week that most people have really been living differently.The electorate has barely begun to digest the most dramatic change in how Americans live and work since at least Sept. 11, 2001. We are still at the very front end of things.So before you start making guesses about November, just consider that almost no sane person would have predicted eight months ago anything like the events of the past seven days.Last July would you have gone with, “Joe Biden declared the Democratic nominee by acclamation in mid-March after the remaining primaries have been indefinitely scrapped because of a public health emergency?” We’d buy a whole raft of Boston coolers (at a reasonable social distance) for the man or woman who picked that particular square on the political tipboard.We’ve only been having even a minor national discussion about coronavirus and contagion for less than two months, about the time that the administration in relatively modest tones announced a public health emergency to shut off travel from China.It was only three weeks ago that President Trump was completely blowing off the idea of mass infection. There would, he said, be fewer than 15 cases by the end of February, “down to close to zero.”The first death in the U.S. was a nursing home in the Seattle suburbs on Leap Day. In the following two weeks, world markets started to buckle under the pressures of disrupted international commerce and what was increasingly an absolute shutdown of Europe.But while there were certainly early American adopters on coronavirus closures, it was only after the president gave his speech last Wednesday that things really got wild.Having watched him heave his way through that one – and the White House hazmat fact-check mop up after – institutional leaders of the corporate, academic and cultural kinds realized that the federal cavalry was still trying to get astride its mounts.That’s what, in part, gave us the two historic days that followed. Without a clear message from the public sector, the privates took command. Human resources and risk management executives from Miami to Seattle started implementing the protocols that they have been obediently writing, re-writing and improving for decades – while being studiously ignored by most of their colleagues.Regular America was not prepared for compliance. It went down hard.In a WSJ/NBC News survey taken between Wednesday and Friday of last week, 78 percent of respondents said that the virus had changed their lives either not at all or in “only a small way.” What do you think those numbers would look like today, one week later?Whatever they took away from Trump’s speech, the shared sentiment seems to have been with the president’s hot mic moment before he began.When the National Collegiate Athletic Association closes March Madness at a cost to itself (and the scholarship money it pays out) of nearly a billion dollars after its massive insurance policy, you know the sauerkraut is getting pretty sticky – and everybody did know it. That’s the kind of institution that still has extra-governmental powers, even in this frayed society. When the NCAA and its peers like Disney theme parks, Little League baseball and the dense network of professional associations and organizations that shut down gatherings, social pressure for precautions intensified throughout the day Friday and into the weekend.Americans, many of whom had been skeptical just days before, jumped into action.The churches that closed their doors Sunday, the families that took a loved one in trouble to safety and the supervisors who stayed all night so that their crews could go home have probably done far more to prevent losses from this epidemic than anything the federal government will ever do.By Monday, the shutdown wave was just climbing toward its apogee. On Wednesday, they shuttered the auto plants.The word from governmental entities up and down the line was, ahem, uneven as leaders tried to catch up.As a note of Appalachian origins, we’d like to thank West Virginia’s governor, Jim Justice, for being extremely on brand with his misguided Monday encouragement to the Mountain State and its fourth-oldest population in the nation that, “if you want to go to Bob Evans and eat, go to Bob Evans and eat.”But in this time of panic, not even the crispy deliciousness of country-fried steak in sawmill gravy was exempt. Justice ordered all the restaurants in the state close for sit-down service the next day.Now, a week and a day after the Oval Office speech, America and its leaders are very different. Trump has gone from aggressive virus minimizer to self-described “wartime president.” Democrats are trying to sound supportive (if only grudgingly so). And voters are stuck at home contemplating collapsed retirement funds and wondering what fresh freak-out is next.So it’s safe to say that we don’t know much, if anything, about the medium-term political consequences here. We wouldn’t even feel much confidence talking about the short term.But we do have questions.The biggest being: How long will these massive shutdowns go on? That, of course, depends on how successful the shutdown will be at minimizing the spread of the illness.Will this be like the 1979-80 energy crisis was for Jimmy Carter or will it be, as Trump hopes, an opportunity to wield wartime powers and enjoy wartime national unity?Will Democrats be able to hold a convention at all? Will the disrupted nomination process deprive Joe Biden of the traditional “win bonus?” Can Biden even scratch his way into the national discussion?Will the smothered economy and imploded financial markets starve campaigns of cash as donors cinch their purse strings?Will state election officials conclude that mail-in voting is the only prudent course as they prepare ballots this summer, especially if there are serious concerns about an autumn flare up? What does that do to voter participation?Will Trump be long deprived of his mass rallies, the centerpiece of his re-election campaign?Will this be like the other crises of our young century and increase the national appetite for governmental intervention or will this further erode confidence in government to the point that large-scale programs become unappealing?Once we start getting some answers to these, then we can get back in the business of forecasting. Until then, we’ll be watching and waiting.THE RULEBOOK: SHOCKER “IT IS not a little remarkable that in every case reported by ancient history, in which government has been established with deliberation and consent, the task of framing it has not been committed to an assembly of men, but has been performed by some individual citizen of preeminent wisdom and approved integrity.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 38TIME OUT: VIVA LAS VEGASHistory: “In an attempt to lift the state out of the hard times of the Great Depression, [on this day in 1931] the Nevada state legislature votes to legalize gambling. Located in the Great Basin desert, few settlers chose to live in Nevada after the United States acquired the territory at the end of the Mexican War in 1848. … [In 1864] during the Civil War, Nevada was hastily made the 36th state in order to strengthen the Union. At the beginning of the Depression, Nevada’s mines were in decline, and its economy was in shambles. In March 1931, Nevada’s state legislature responded to population flight by taking the drastic measure of legalizing gambling and, later in the year, divorce. Established in 1905, Las Vegas, Nevada, has since become the gambling and entertainment capital of the world… In the first few decades after the legalization of gambling, organized crime flourished in Las Vegas. Today, state gambling taxes account for the lion’s share of Nevada’s overall tax revenues.”Flag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARDESTIMATED DELEGATES FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATIONBiden: 1181Sanders: 885[Ed. note: 1,991 delegates needed to win]TRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE Average approval: 43.8 percentAverage disapproval: 51.8 percentNet Score: -8 percentChange from one week ago: ↑ 0.4 points[Average includes: NPR/PBS News/Marist: 43% approve - 50% disapprove; NBC News/WSJ: 46% approve - 51% disapprove; Gallup: 44% approve - 52% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 41% approve - 54% disapprove; CNN: 45% approve - 52% disapprove.]WANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT? You can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

LISTEN AND SUBSCRIBE HEREPELOSI HOLDS TIGHT GRIP ON NEXT STIMULUS PLANPolitico: “House Democrats are drafting a new stimulus bill to address the coronavirus pandemic — legislation designed as their counter-offer to a trillion-dollar package currently being assembled in the Republican-controlled Senate. On a private call Wednesday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi directed her leadership team and committee chairs to begin further efforts to address the looming economic disaster caused by the growing coronavirus crisis. The House Democratic plan will incorporate proposals from several panels and is expected to include additional unemployment insurance payments, expanded Medicaid coverage, an airline rescue package, relief for homeowners and renters, support for small businesses, and additional food security measures, according to Democratic lawmakers and aides. … Each House committee will submit their own plans to Pelosi, who will compile a large-scale relief package in the coming days. Pelosi and her top deputies plan to review the ideas with Democrats — who are working from their districts this week — on a conference call Thursday afternoon.”Mnuchin: Coronavirus stimulus plan could deliver $3K to family of four - Roll Call: “The emerging $1 trillion aid package intended to help weather the COVID-19 economic storm appears likely to deliver $1,000 to every U.S. adult, plus $500 per child, according to Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and a GOP senator involved in the drafting. ‘So for a family of four, that's a $3,000 payment,’ Mnuchin told Fox Business on Thursday morning, adding that he thinks the checks would be sent within three weeks of enactment. ‘That may change in negotiations with Democrats, but that’s the priority right now,’ Mitt Romney of Utah said on the Hugh Hewitt radio show, confirming the basic structure of the plan under discussion. Mnuchin said a second round of checks in the same amount would go out six weeks later if economic conditions haven't improved and the ‘national emergency’ Trump declared last week is still in effect. Mnuchin said most households wouldn't have to worry about venturing outside to the bank to cash their checks and risk virus exposure: ‘It's really money direct-deposited, most people.’”Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart, Ben McAdams first lawmakers to test positive - Fox News: “Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., on Wednesday became the first member of Congress to announce that he has tested positive for coronavirus, saying he had been stricken with a fever and headache this weekend. Shortly afterward, Rep. Ben McAdams, D-Utah, said he too had tested positive after developing ‘mild cold-like symptoms’ Sunday evening. The 45-year-old told constituents he first learned the test result Wednesday. As the news broke, Republican whip Steve Scalise, R-La., issued a statement announcing he would go into quarantine, although he said he did not currently have any symptoms. … Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Mo., said she would also self-quarantine, although she had no symptoms, because last week she ‘participated in a small group meeting with a colleague who has since tested positive for COVID-19.’”The Judge’s Ruling: Freedom in a Time of Madness - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano explains Coronavirus fear, our freedom and the Constitution: “The Contracts Clause of the Constitution prohibits the states from interfering with lawful contracts, such as leases and employment agreements. And the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the states from interfering with life, liberty or property without a trial at which the state must prove fault. The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment requires just compensation when the state meaningfully interferes with an owner’s chosen lawful use of his property. Taken together, these clauses reveal the significant protections of private property in the Constitution itself. … Why is this happening? Throughout history, free people have been willing to accept the devil's bargain of trading liberty for safety when they are fearful. We supinely accept the shallow and hollow offers of government that somehow less liberty equals more safety.” More here.TRUMP TO HAVE CALL WITH NATION’S GOVERNORS Politico: “The nation’s governors are going to be talking to President Donald Trump and VP Mike Pence today at 2 p.m. here are the five things they are going to ask from Trump and the federal government: 1) They want the government to dedicate at least half of the supplemental funding directly to states and for the W.H. to provide quick action on waiver requests. 2) They want increased access to personal protective equipment, masks, test kits, extraction kits and to quicken the production of life-saving equipment like ventilators. 3) Support Title 32 -- which allows governors to call National Guardsmen to active duty, with the approval of the president. 4) They want guidance on the implementation of the Defense Production Act -- they want to know what the administration is prioritizing. 5) Allow more time for completion of the Census and REAL ID.”Trump: FDA making anti-malaria drug available for virus - Fox News: “President Trump announced Thursday that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is making experimental drugs -- including those used for treating malaria -- available as part of the ongoing effort to tackle the spread of the coronavirus. Trump announced at a White House press briefing that chloroquine, a drug designed for use in malaria, has been FDA approved and will be made available by prescription ‘almost immediately.’ He said it was one of a number of antiviral therapies to limit the symptoms of the virus that the administration is trying to get to Americans as quickly as possible. … Addressing potential safety concerns, Trump noted that it had been used previously in treating malaria, ‘so we know if things don't go as planned, it’s not going to kill anybody.’ He said it had shown ‘very encouraging’ early results. He also said another drug, remdesivir, would be made available to Americans as well by the process of ‘compassionate use.’ He said it would remain to be seen whether it would help combat the crisis.”PLAY-BY-PLAYSanders to head home to Vermont, will reassess campaign - WaPoTulsi Gabbard suspends long-shot campaign, endorses Biden - Fox NewsBill Weld drops quixotic primary bid against Trump - NYTWhen it comes to Election Day in November, only Congress can change the date - WSJReport: State Department moves toward advising against all international travel - Fox NewsAUDIBLE: SAME THOUGH“Will work for donuts.” – The phrase on the t-shirt Jeb Bush sported in a video about social distancing with his granddaughter, per the NYT.FROM THE BLEACHERS“I took note of the comment by Mr. Jim Hain [in Wednesday’s Halftime Report] concerning preparations for the lean times.

Last week, Melissa and Lee Katrincic, owners of Durham Distillery, which makes Conniption Gin … [wanted to help their community.] The answer was close by. Durham Distillery has an active permit with the state-run Alcohol Beverage Control commission (ABC), which allows the couple’s company to buy corn-based ethanol at 95% alcohol by volume. That permit, coupled with Lee Katrincic’s experience from his twenty-four-year tenure as a pharmaceutical chemist, gave the company both the ability and the means to create the cleaner earlier this week. Mixing their ethanol with distilled water brings the solution down to 70% alcohol by volume, matching levels recommended for sanitizing solutions by the Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization. So instead of producing gin, the distillery has temporarily switched focus to producing their cleaning solution.”AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES…“The arguments for and against the filibuster are so well-known to both parties as to be practically memorized.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on April 6, 2017.Chris Stirewalt is the politics editor for Fox News. Brianna McClelland contributed to this report.

"                          Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell provides updates on the coronavirus funding bill. Saying lawmakers ""need to take bold and swift action as soon as possible,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday introduced legislation to provide as much as $1,200 per person and $2,400 per couple in the U.S. amid the coronavirus outbreak and skyrocketing jobless claims. The draft legislation, obtained by Fox News, would provide minimum payments of $600, and aid would be phased down at adjusted gross income thresholds of $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 per couple. Additionally, there would be $500 payments for each child. The rebate amount is slated to then be reduced by $5 for each $100 a taxpayer’s income exceeds the legislation's threshold. The amount is therefore reduced to zero for single taxpayers with incomes exceeding $99,000 and $198,000 for joint filers. The IRS would determine income based on taxpayers' 2018 tax returns, or 2019 tax returns in cases where there is no 2018 return -- a provision that The Federalist's Sean Davis called ""idiotic,"" given that many ""jobs or businesses disappeared within the last month."" Qualifying income includes earned income, as well as Social Security retirement benefits and certain compensation and pension benefits paid to veterans. This approach ""ensures relief gets to low-income seniors and disabled veterans"" as well, top Republicans said in their summary of the legislation. READ MCCONNELL'S STIMULUS PROPOSAL And, similar to previous disaster-related relief provisions, the bill would ""waive the 10-percent early withdrawal penalty for distributions up to $100,000 from qualified retirement accounts for coronavirus-related purposes."" McConnell's proposal aligns with the Trump administration's push to swiftly send checks to U.S. citizens. The legislation additionally contains numerous provisions geared at helping small businesses, including a delay of payment for employer payroll taxes, a delay of estimated tax payments for corporations, and modifications for net operating losses.

Phillip)       McConnell's plan would provide $208 billion in loans and loan guarantees to distressed sectors of the economy, including $50 billion for commercial airlines and $8 billion for air cargo carriers, and $150 billion for other eligible businesses, but those loans would have to be paid back. It's an opening salvo in fast-track talks with Democrats as President Trump urges Congress to “go big” to respond as Americans reel from the crisis. McConnell, R-Ky., speaking on the Senate floor, said he wanted key Republicans to meet with Democrats on the relief bill, known as S.3548, Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (Phase III). READ REPUBLICANS' SECTION-BY-SECTION SUMMARY OF THE BILL ""These are urgent discussions and they need to happen at the member level,"" McConnell said, noting the White House will send key personnel to talk about the bill as they try to forge a compromise. Fox News is told McConnell did not yet have the votes on his side, and that the situation was complicated by the fact that two Republicans have self-quarantined. The GOP holds a slim 53-47 majority in the Senate, with Vice President Mike Pence the possible tiebreaking vote. Speaking after McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., complained that Republicans had sought ""no input"" from Democrats, and asserted that no Democrats had even seen the bill. He added he was told ""there is a bailout for industries"" in the measure. ""The number one priority is addressing this health crisis, which requires a Marshall Plan to rebuild our health care infrastructure on a continental scale and ensure the resources are there to test and treat everyone who needs it,"" Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a joint statement. “To earn Democratic support in the Congress, any economic stimulus proposal must include new, strong and strict provisions that prioritize and protect workers, such as banning the recipient companies from buying back stock, rewarding executives, and laying off workers,"" they added. “We look forward to working in a bipartisan way to deliver for the American people as soon as humanly possible.” ILHAN OMAR PRAISES TRUMP'S 'INCREDIBLE' CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE Even some of McConnell's GOP senators have said they preferred instead to use the federal dollars to keep workers who are asked to stay home on the business payrolls. “What I want is income, not one check,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., summing up the views of some exiting a long, private meeting of GOP senators on Capitol Hill. One or two checks “makes no sense to me,” he said. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday morning told Fox Business Network that the White House was looking at payments of $1,000 to most adult Americans within three weeks, as a way to stem the widespread economic damage caused by shuttered businesses and social distancing.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)       Mnuchin also said that if the crisis were still ongoing in six weeks, the federal government would deliver another round of checks worth the same amount of money. The Treasury secretary said Thursday the checks would be direct-deposited into people’s accounts. Though unusual, stimulus checks are not unprecedented. Former President George W. Bush's administration twice successfully pushed for economic stimulus checks. Meanwhile, President Trump on Wednesday signed the second coronavirus relief bill into law that provides paid sick leave, unemployment help and free testing to Americans. INSIDE CHINA'S PROPAGANDA PUSH ON CORONAVIRUS The legislation provides 14 days of paid sick days to workers affected by the coronavirus, ensures free testing to everyone, including the uninsured, and expands food aid and boosts unemployment dollars to states. The House and Senate already passed a bipartisan $8.3 billion package to prop up the health care system to prepare for the influx of sick Americans. The second response bill that was signed into law Wednesday aims to bring relief to workers who lost their jobs and families at home for illnesses, quarantines or caring for kids whose schools have shuttered. Fox News' Chad Pergram, Brooke Singman, Mike Emanuel, and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

"                          Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Businesswoman Marie Newman and her pro-choice allies ousted Rep. Dan Lipinski, D-Ill., an eight-term, pro-life incumbent on Tuesday, and in doing so, ignited accusations that the Democratic Party had solidified a hostile apparatus for members who oppose abortion. The narrow loss for Lipinski marked the end of an era in which his father -- another pro-life Democrat -- held that seat since 1983. The younger Lipinski’s loss came as the abortion debate intensified with national and state-level laws bringing an already hot-button issue to the forefront of political battles. AOC’S PICK IN DEMOCRAT PRIMARY FOR HOUSE SEAT BEATS INCUMBENT Planned Parenthood Votes, a political project of the nation’s largest abortion provider, recently announced its most ambitious electoral effort to date with $45 million in spending nationwide. That included funding for a $1.4 million initiative -- comprising direct mail and digital and television ad buys -- it and other pro-choice groups led, creating what pro-life leaders are describing as an onslaught of negative ads against Lipinski.       Rep. Dan Lipinski, D-Ill., an eight-term, pro-life incumbent on Tuesday, was ousted in a Democratic primary on Tuesday.      (Reuters/Kamil Krzacznski) ""I think they can claim it,"" Marjorie Dannenfelser, head of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, told Fox News when asked about the impact of groups like NARAL and Planned Parenthood Votes on Tuesday’s election. In his concession speech, Lipinski similarly argued that pro-choice groups beat him by capitalizing on his anti-abortion background -- which was also present when he beat Newman in 2018. MEET THE PRO-LIFE DEMOCRAT BEHIND ONE OF THE SUPREME COURT'S MOST CONTROVERSIAL CASES FOR 2020 In the days after Tuesday’s primary, it’s unclear what exactly drove voters to the polls. Lipinski, whose team touted his support among older voters, could have lost needed turnout due to social distancing guidance surrounding the coronavirus. Planned Parenthood Votes, however, maintains that Lipinski’s record was a major factor in his loss, and that its status as a trusted third-party helped validate Illinois voters’ opposition to abortion regulations. The group said its internal polling -- conducted in conjunction with EMILY's List, NARAL, SEIU, and other organizations -- showed a majority (62 percent) of Lipinski’s residents saying they were less likely to vote for him after learning about his anti-abortion views (opposing abortion access, voting to defund Planned Parenthood, and receiving money from pro-life groups). They also point to national polls showing support for Roe v. Wade -- the landmark Supreme Court decision blocking certain state-level abortion restrictions. It’s unclear whether those polls asked about specific restrictions on abortion, but pro-life groups say voters were closer to Lipinski than the rest of his party on those particulars. In-person surveys administered by Students for Life showed about 70 percent of Lipinski’s residents overwhelmingly opposing taxpayer funding for abortion and favoring restrictions on the procedure after five months. After Newman’s 2018 loss, she out-fundraised Lipinski in a political climate increasingly dominated by concerns about health care and abortion. The stakes have “never” been higher, Planned Parenthood Votes executive director Jenny Lawson previously said. PLANNED PARENTHOOD LAUNCHES 2020 INITIATIVE WITH ENDORSEMENTS, FIVE-FIGURE AD BUY Lipinski opposed recent efforts to weaken Obamacare but initially opposed the law partially due to abortion-related provisions. That was a “watershed moment,” according to Dannenfelser, who said Obama “helped crystallize complete polarization of the issue.” Dannenfelser previously worked for a pro-life Democrat in Congress and directed the pro-life caucus. Derrick Jones, the chief marketing officer for the National Right to Life Committee, charged that Tuesday’s results reflected the culmination of the party’s decadeslong drift towards extremism on the issue. Lipinski’s primary loss was particularly symbolic since he co-chairs the pro-life caucus, said Jones, whose organization sent pro-Lipinski mailers in his district. Around Democrats for Life’s founding in the late 1990s, the group listed more than 40 pro-life Democrats in Congress. Today, the number is much smaller and a far cry from the majorities Danenfelser says she fought to build in the late 80s. For example, only three Democrats, including Lipinski, voted in February to reconsider a bill that would mandate medical care for infants who survive abortion attempts. Party leadership had blocked it dozens of times from coming to the floor. And both NARAL, which endorsed Newman, and Obama have opposed those types of measures. Polling from the Women Speak Out PAC, which is affiliated with SBA List, showed 75 percent of likely Democratic primary voters in Lipinski’s district supported protections for babies who survive failed abortions. Democrats for Life executive director Kristen Day, who also worked for a pro-life Democrat in Congress, suggested the groups like SBA List didn't do enough to support Lipinski. But more so, Day put the onus on party leadership, which Danenfelser says “watched [Lipinski] die” in his primary. The Illinois Democratic Party and Democratic National Committee (DNC) did not respond to Fox News’ requests for comment. HOUSE DEMS QUASH BILL MANDATING MEDICAL CARE FOR INFANTS WHO SURVIVE ABORTIONS “We need to get rid of Tom Perez,"" Day said, citing to the DNC chair's position on pro-life Democrats. Newman didn't just receive endorsements from progressive leaders and Illinois lawmakers. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), which typically supports incumbents, also offered what’s been described as tepid support for Lipinski’s re-election. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In a statement provided to Fox News, DCCC Chair Cheri Bustos, D-Ill., praised Lipinski’s service. But it's been pointed out that she backed out of a Lipinski fundraiser amid pressure over his pro-life record. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., traveled to Texas to campaign for Rep. Henry Cuellar, an anti-abortion Democrat, but didn’t do the same for Lipinski. Day said after Lipinski’s election that Democrats like herself might just stay home in the presidential election. While she maintains hope for state-level candidates opposing abortion, she warns that emboldened pro-life Democrats may send a national message by sitting out the 2020 presidential election.

"                          Bernie Sanders denies reports he will suspend his campaign after Biden sweeps primaries; Biden campaign senior adviser Symone Sanders reacts. Conversations are underway between the campaigns of former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont regarding the coronavirus pandemic, with a top aide saying the contact is at “a senior level.” The communication between the camps of two remaining Democratic presidential candidates comes as Sanders is mulling his next political move – after a string of devastating primary losses on Tuesday at the hands of the former vice president. BIDEN AND SANDERS LAST CANDIDATES STANDING AS LONG-SHOT GABBARD DROPS OUT OF THE RACE Sanders’ campaign on Wednesday emphasized that “the next primary contest is at least three weeks away. Sen. Sanders is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign.” Biden’s landslide victory in Florida, his crushing defeat of Sanders in Illinois, and his win in Arizona cemented his status as the presumptive Democratic nominee and all but closed the door to the senator’s extremely narrow path to win the nomination. Both candidates late last week gave policy addresses laying out their plans to combat the coronavirus outbreak that’s sweeping across America – as well as steps to assist Americans devastated by the growing economic downturn caused by the pandemic. And both contenders have continued to spotlight their efforts and ideas this week in their public comments. Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said that “since last week, the Biden and Sanders campaigns have been in regular contact at a senior level to discuss how the coronavirus is affecting the campaigns, how to adjust schedules and activities in light of that – as well as to discuss both Vice President Biden’s and Senator Sanders’ ideas on policy responses to the virus.” “While the two campaigns obviously have their differences, they are working together to try to promote the health and safety of their teams, those who interact with the campaigns, and the American people,” she added. Biden camp accuses Trump of downplaying outbreak In a taste of the general election battle ahead, Biden’s campaign on Thursday charged that President Trump is attempting “to erase his months of ignoring medical experts who were sounding the alarm.” “Time after time, President Trump has failed the American people through his negligent and incompetent response to a global health pandemic — squandering months as he blithely downplayed its risks,” Bedingfield argued. An email from the Biden campaign then includes a series of statements and comments from the president from late January through early March where he appeared to be downplaying the severity of the approaching coronavirus outbreak. The list starts with Trump saying on Jan. 22 that “we have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.” And it ends with the president commenting on Monday of last week that “nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!” The Trump campaign hit back in a statement to Fox News. “The only thing Joe Biden knows about handling a public health crisis is that the Obama White House had to apologize for his remarks that set off a panic during the swine flu outbreak in 2009,” said Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign communications director. Said Murtaugh: “And when President Trump took the critical step of restricting travel from China in response to the coronavirus, Biden called it ‘xenophobic.’ Most of what Biden says the government should do are things President Trump is already doing.  The President is leading an unprecedented mobilization of America against the coronavirus and all Joe Biden can offer is ineffective partisan sniping from the sidelines.” As of Thursday afternoon, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported more than 10,000 domestic cases of COVID-19 – the disease caused by the coronavirus – with the death toll standing at 150.” More primaries postponed Connecticut is the latest state with an upcoming presidential primary to postpone its nominating contest. ""In coordination with other states and our Secretary of the State, and in an effort to carry out Democracy while keeping public health a top priority, I have decided to move our presidential primary to June 2nd,"" Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont tweeted on Thursday. With the pandemic sweeping across the nation, presidential primaries that took place Tuesday in Arizona, Florida, and Illinois may well be the last nominating contests held for the next couple of months. Ohio’s primary was also scheduled to be held Tuesday – but state officials used emergency powers to postpone the contest hours before the polls were set to open. After the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) urged against any gatherings of 50 people or more, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine stressed on Monday that “we cannot conduct this election tomorrow.” Primaries scheduled for next Tuesday in Georgia, April 4 in Louisiana, and May 19 in Kentucky already have been pushed back to later dates. Maryland announced earlier this week that their April 28 primary is being postponed until June 2. Democratic Party officials in Puerto Rico – which would hold its contest on March 29 – are seeking a delay as well. More delays are likely to follow for states scheduled to hold contests in the coming weeks. Biden grabs another high profile endorsement Another former 2020 Democratic presidential nomination rival is backing Biden. This time it’s Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. The former White House hopeful saying in a statement on Thursday that “it is clear that our country desperately needs a president with experience, honesty and integrity -- that person is Vice President Joe Biden. Not only does Joe have the experience to lead our country, but he has the empathy and character to go with it.” Gillibrand – who made championing the rights of women an integral part of her presidential campaign – took shots at the former vice president during the second round of primary debates in late July of last year.  Running short on campaign cash and failing to resonate in the polls, Gillibrand ended her presidential bid a month later.

"                          Fox Business host Stuart Varney believes a recession is on the way. Ray Dalio, the billionaire founder of hedge fund behemoth Bridgewater Associates, sounded the alarm Thursday over the coronavirus crisis and said U.S. corporations will lose up to $4 trillion and President Trump needs to dramatically increase his stimulus plan. NEWSOM ISSUES STAY AT HOME ORDER Dalio’s comments come a day after Bill Ackman, another billionaire investor, called on the president to shut down the country for 30 days or “America will end as we know it.” CORONAVIRUS LATEST Few people understand the global economy like Dalio. He told CNBC that the coronavirus crisis is something not seen “in our lifetime.” He said there will be some who suffer “very big losses” and in order to soften the blow, the federal government needs to spend more money. “A lot more money.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell unveiled a sweeping economic rescue plan Thursday to pump $1,200 direct checks to taxpayers, $300 billion for small businesses to keep idled workers on payroll and $208 billion in loans to airlines and other industries. The GOP leader’s effort builds on Trump’s request for Congress to “go big” as lawmakers race to craft a $1 trillion economic aid and stimulus package amid the pandemic crisis and nationwide shutdown that’s hurtling the country toward a likely recession.       Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates LP, speaks during a panel discussion at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Beijing, China, on Thursday, Nov. 21, 2019. PHOTO: Takaaki Iwabu/Bloomberg via Getty Images       Dalio said the stimulus package should be, minimum, $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion. The Federal Reserve put in motion two emergency lending programs Tuesday that were last deployed in response to the 2008 financial crisis, aiming to ease the flow of credit to businesses and households struggling amid the viral outbreak. The first is intended to unclog a short-term lending market for what is known as “commercial paper.” The second is also intended to mostly assist the commercial paper market and allows a wider range of financial institutions to access short-term loans from the Fed — in this case investment banks and securities trading divisions of large banks. It also allows them to pledge a wider range of collateral in return for the loans. The funds will then mostly be used to purchase commercial paper.

In a video posted to her Twitter account, Blackburn called China's threats to plunge the U.S. into a ""mighty sea of coronavirus"" by withholding access to critical medication a national security and public health issue. ""Relying on foreign countries like China for instance, for our pharmaceutical supply chain can lead us to critical shortages,"" she said.

China maintains a grip on the global supply chain. Though the United States is a global leader in research, much of the manufacturing of lifesaving drugs has moved overseas.

"                          Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. It was a cruel mirage. The midday sun burned off the chill of the March morning. Foreboding, iron-grey clouds slinked away. A low sun finally pried its way through the sheath, teasing a powder-blue sky. The U.S. Capitol Dome spiked into the air. An American flag flapping in the east wind. The temperature struggled into the low sixties. It was a reminder that spring was just days away. The panorama was nearly perfect. But this wasn’t an honest tableau. It was a deceitful scene, a trick. One that hid the misery and pain lurking at the microbial level. A cloak shrouding pending economic chaos and human catastrophe inflicted by the coronavirus. This wasn’t any ordinary sun shining down on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. This was a 9/11 sun. We’ve seen that sun before in Washington, D.C. In New York City. In Shanksville, Pa. Sept. 11, 2001, was a radiant day in the eastern U.S. And as the World Trade Center Towers smoldered and the Pentagon belched a tower of soot, that same, brilliant sun mocked us. The firefighters who raced to douse the flames only to perish in an inferno. The military pilots who contemplated a suicide mission. They discussed ramming their jet fighters into the rogue commercial aircraft bound for Washington. The people who dashed from the Capitol, losing heels and strewing briefcases along the East Front, sprinting for their lives. This sun was a fraud on Tuesday. An imposter, concealing perhaps weeks and months of social upheaval that could resonate for a generation. Each day, the information grows more grim. The market tanks. The cases rise. Companies shred jobs. There are no sports. No bars. No theater. No concerts. It doesn’t take much of an imagination to envision a dystopian world resembling the album cover of practically every heavy metal band from the 1980s. I saw the sun Tuesday because I wasn’t in the U.S. Capitol very much that day. Or Wednesday, for that matter. On a normal day when Congress is in session, I may be inside the Capitol complex for 10 to 12 hours at a time. During President Trump’s impeachment trial -- which I’m pretty sure happened around the time of the Moon Landing -- I may have arrived at the Capitol just as dawn broke. As the trial drifted deep into the night, I wouldn’t experience fresh air again until close to midnight after doing a live report or two once the session wrapped.       Chad Pergram reporting from Capitol Hill.       But now we have to engage in “social distancing.” The U.S. Capitol complex is scarily vacant these days. The Rotunda is empty and hollow. It echoes like a mausoleum. Paintings of George Washington and Hernando De Soto stare at each other. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Here’s who’s at the U.S. Capitol each day: U.S. Capitol Police officers. Custodial staff. Maintenance staff. Some of the “institutional” staff. Most House and Senate aides have teleworked for a while now. As House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., negotiated the “phase 2” coronavirus package with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Congressional Republicans last week, only a smattering of lawmakers was anywhere near the Capitol. They kept their distance. Most lawmakers only rolled in after midnight early Saturday to vote on the bill. The House roll call ended at 12:51 am. PHOTOS: CORONAVIRUS SAFEGUARDS AND ACTIONS ACROSS THE US But who waited outside Pelosi’s office all day and deep into the night? A cadre of journalists. The Capitol press corps numbers are a lot lower than usual right now. But the reporters vastly outnumber the aides and certainly senators who periodically wander by. Mnuchin huddled with a group of Republican senators in the Mike Mansfield Room of the Capitol Monday night to discuss upcoming legislative steps. Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., exited the meeting in the Ohio Clock Corridor. Reporters were torn. They needed to talk to Braun to get a readout -- but also keep their distance. Reporters fanned out, hollering questions at Braun from several feet away. When someone asked the Indiana Republican to speak up, Braun instinctively stepped closer to the reporters. Someone gently admonished the senator not to come closer but just to talk a little louder. Senate Republicans finally stopped squeezing together for their regular conclaves in the Mansfield Room of the Capitol or the even tinier Strom Thurmond Room. When Mnuchin, White House Economic Adviser Larry Kudlow and White House Legislative Director Eric Ueland met with Senate Republicans Tuesday, they convened in the much grander Kennedy Caucus Room in the Russell Senate Office Building. The room is best known for hosting Supreme Court confirmation hearings and investigations into the sinking of the Titanic. By Thursday, Republican senators began conducting their meetings in the even more commodious “Central Hearing Facility” in the Hart Senate Office Building. That room hosted confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh of late. Senate Democrats have held their discussions via conference call. PHOTOS: EMPTY PLACES ACROSS AMERICA Few senators roamed anywhere near the chamber all week except when the Senate called a series of votes Wednesday afternoon on the “phase 2” coronavirus bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., advised senators he would elongate roll call votes from the standard 15 minutes to 30 minutes (even though most usually take about 25). “Senators should come in, vote and leave,” instructed McConnell, worried that senators would congregate for long chunks of time in the well of the chamber. And so, this is what makes it hard as a reporter to cover Congress in the time of coronavirus. The Capitol press corps usually stakes out lawmakers in the Senate subway stations, just off the floor, by committee rooms and in the Speaker’s Lobby. It may not be hygienic for a gaggle of reporters to cluster around a member -- or even chat one-on-one, walking through the tunnel to the Russell Senate Office Building. Under normal circumstances, most TV reporters do their live reports from several different locations on Capitol Hill. One such spot is called the “Will Rogers” area near the House floor. That’s because it’s close to the Will Rogers Statue. A lot of other reports come from the rotundas in the Russell Building or the Cannon House Office Building. But, since it’s spring, and the weather is improving, Fox News made an effort to do live reports from a location near the House steps, known as the Elm Tree. That’s a misnomer because the Elm Tree that used to stand there is long gone. But the spot presents a dynamic, television-friendly backdrop of the U.S. Capitol. CORONAVIRUS CASES TOP 200,000, DEATH TOLL PASSES 8,000 That’s why I was outside Tuesday afternoon to watch the clouds split, opening the sky to a striking pre-spring day. And there was the sun. Bright. Bold. And an artifice in contrast to the chaos unfolding around the globe. However... The sun rose the morning after 9/11. It also rose on the other 6,753 days between 9/12 and this past Tuesday. The coronavirus scourge will subside at some point. And when the sun shines then, it will serve as a partner. Days of baseball games and strolls by the cherry blossoms near the Tidal Basin here in Washington. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It’s the same sun as it always was. The same sun as on 9/11. The sun that shone over the Spanish Flu. The same sun that stared down on the Bubonic Plague in Europe. That sun may seem cruel now, beaming down on the U.S. Capitol. But it will be there when there are again wedding celebrations. Graduations. Births. Parties. Promotions. Electric first dates. And, those aforementioned ballgames. That may not be the sun as we perceive it now. Pandemics come and go. But not the sun. It will be there on the other side.

In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, President Trump will now hold the annual G-7 Summit in June via teleconference, rather than inviting the other six other G-7 nations to Camp David as originally planned. Trump had originally planned to host the leaders of the seven major industrial nations -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan along with the United States -- at his private golf resort in Miami, before moving it to Camp David after public criticism. Now the leaders will convene electronically to allow “each country to focus all of its resources on responding to the health and economic challenges of COVID-19,” economic advisor Larry Kudlow informed his colleagues, according to White House spokesman Judd Deere. Trump already spoke with G-7 leaders Monday in a meeting organized by French President Emmanuel Macron. Deere said Trump, who holds leadership of the group this year, would hold virtual meetings monthly as the world battles COVID-19 and its economic fallout. The announcement came as the world has faced 229,390 cases of the novel coronavirus and 9,325 deaths and many countries across the globe institute travel bans and social distancing guidelines. The U.S. currently has 10,755 confirmed cases and 154 deaths. Trump irritated certain G-7 nations when he instituted a European travel ban without consulting European leaders.

Former aides to high-ranking Democratic politicians are joining a so-called ""coronavirus war room"" in order to attack President Trump's response to the pandemic. Protect Our Care -- a nonprofit tied to liberal dark money groups -- announced the war room on Thursday, with the group's leader accusing Trump of exacerbating the pandemic. Heading the war room is Zac Petkanas, a former adviser to Hillary Clinton and former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Sarah Chase, a former research associate for the presidential campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., is joining the team as well. Patrick Devlin, former Communications Director for Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., will serve as an adviser to the war room as well.

(AP) Here are some politicians or public officials who have tested positive from the coronavirus:  Massoumeh Ebtekar, Iran’s Vice President for Women and Family Affairs  Iranian state media reported last week that Masoumeh Ebtekar, the country’s Vice President for Women and Family Affairs, had tested positive for the coronavirus.  On March 11, Ebtekar tweeted that she had recovered from the virus while linking to images of Western officials who have contracted the illness. “Iran faces sanctions & psycho-terrorism,” she wrote. “They portray Iran as corona epicenter, accuse us of undercounting, count afflicted officials as proof. Reality: Numbers are clear, thank God I’m back in my office.” Sophie Trudeau, wife of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau  Canadian officials announced last week that Sophie Trudeau, wife of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, had tested positive for the coronavirus and “will remain in isolation for the time being,” along with the rest of the family.

The 42-year-old mayor said he would self-quarantine after learning he had been in contact with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s communications secretary, who had also tested positive for the virus.  MCCONNELL'S CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS PLAN WOULD PROVIDE PAYMENTS OF $1,200 PER PERSON, $2,400 FOR COUPLES Mario Diaz-Balart, Republican lawmaker from Florida Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., this week became the first member of Congress to test positive for the coronavirus, announcing this Wednesday that he had been stricken with a fever and headache over the weekend.  Diaz-Balart has since been in quarantine. In a statement posted on Twitter, he said he was “feeling much better” but urged the public to take the outbreak “extremely seriously and follow CDC [the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] guidelines in order to avoid getting sick and mitigate the spread of this virus.”  Ben McAdams, Democratic lawmaker from Utah Not long after Diaz-Balart’s announcement, Rep. Ben McAdams, D-Utah, said he, too, had tested positive after developing “mild cold-like symptoms” Sunday evening. In an interview with NBC’s “TODAY” show, McAdams likened the feeling of being infected to having “a belt around my chest, and so I couldn’t breathe deeply.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The vast majority of infected people recover, and most have only mild or moderate symptoms.

Dianne Feinstein of California and three of her Senate colleagues sold off stocks worth millions of dollars in the days before the coronavirus outbreak crashed the market, according to reports. The data is listed on a U.S. Senate website containing financial disclosures from Senate members. Feinstein, who serves as ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and her husband sold between $1.5 million and $6 million in stock in California biotech company Allogene Therapeutics, between Jan. 31 and Feb. 18, The New York Times reported. SENS. RICHARD BURR, KELLY LOEFFLER SOLD MILLIONS IN STOCK BEFORE CORONAVIRUS CRIPPLED MARKETS, REPORTS FIND When questioned by the newspaper, a spokesman for the Democrat from San Francisco said Feinstein wasn’t directly involved in the sale. “All of Senator Feinstein’s assets are in a blind trust,” the spokesman, Tom Mentzer, told the Times. “She has no involvement in her husband’s financial decisions.” “All of Senator Feinstein’s assets are in a blind trust. She has no involvement in her husband’s financial decisions.”       Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., is seen in an undated photo. (Associated Press)       Reports identified the three other senators as Richard Burr of North Carolina, Kelly Loeffler of Georgia and James Inhofe of Oklahoma, all Republicans. Burr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, used more than 30 transactions to dump between $628,000 and $1.72 million on Feb. 13, according to ProPublica. The report said the transactions involved a significant percentage of the senator’s holdings and took place about a week before the impact of the virus outbreak sent stock prices plunging to the point where gains made during President Trump’s term in office were largely erased. “Senator Burr filed a financial disclosure form for personal transactions made several weeks before the U.S. and financial markets showed signs of volatility due to the growing coronavirus outbreak,” a Burr spokesperson said. “As the situation continues to evolve daily, he has been deeply concerned by the steep and sudden toll this pandemic is taking on our economy.” Burr was an author of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, a law that helps determine the federal response to situations such as the coronavirus outbreak, ProPublica reported. Burr’s office would not comment on what kind of information Burr might have received about coronavirus prior to his stock sales, the outlet reported. NPR reported that Burr made more ominous comments about coronavirus behind closed doors last month. “There’s one thing that I can tell you about this: It is much more aggressive in its transmission than anything that we have seen in recent history,” Burr said at a Feb. 27 meeting of business leaders in Washington. “It is probably more akin to the 1918 pandemic.” Loeffler was appointed to the Senate in December by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp after incumbent Sen. Johnny Isakson resigned because of health issues – despite allies of President Trump having urged Kemp to select Rep. Doug Collins instead. Loeffler and her husband, Jeffrey Sprecher, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, sold stock Jan. 24, the same day she sat in on a briefing from two members of Trump’s Coronavirus Task Force, The Daily Beast reported. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Between that day and Feb. 14, the couple sold stock worth a total between $1.2 million and $3.1 million, the report said. In addition to the sales, they also purchased stock in a maker of software that helps people work at home – just before millions of Americans were forced to leave their offices because of the outbreak, the report said. Loeffler slammed the Daily Beast report as a ""ridiculous and baseless attack"" in a pair of late-night tweets. ""This is a ridiculous and baseless attack. I do not make investment decisions for my portfolio. Investment decisions are made by multiple third-party advisors without my or my husband's knowledge or involvement,"" Loeffler wrote. ""As confirmed in the periodic transaction report to Senate Ethics, I was informed of these purchases and sales on February 16, 2020 — three weeks after they were made."" Imhofe sold as much as $400,000 in stock all on Jan. 27, in companies such as PayPal, Apple and real estate company Brookfield Asset Management, The New York Times reported.

"                          Trump signs the Defense Production Act to possibly ramp up inventories of desperately needed medical supplies; chief White House correspondent John Roberts reports. We are about to embark on a trillion-dollar effort to bolster an economy being ravaged by the coronavirus. And given the magnitude of the problem, everyone in politics is scrambling to get on board. Never mind that Republicans have long been the party of limited government, shrinking deficits and battling bailouts. Perhaps it’s true that in a pandemic, we’re all socialists. In any event, President Trump is leading the effort, and he has virtually total control over the GOP as he runs for reelection. I’ve long argued that both parties are hypocritical when it comes to red ink, denouncing it only when the other party controls the White House. But that argument is moot right now. A virtual shutdown of America requires a response akin to war -- a term the administration is now using regularly. BIDEN’S VICTORIES SWALLOWED BY VIRUS, LIKE MUCH OF AMERICAN LIFE The damage to the economy grows by the day. The stock market has nose-dived, giving up all its gains since Trump took office. Businesses across the country, especially retail outlets, are laying off workers or slashing their pay (jobless claims, up 70,000 last week, are starting to soar). And tens of millions of Americans are hunkered down at home and not spending money. Trump is pushing Congress to approve $500 billion in cash payments to Americans, $300 billion to help small businesses, $50 billion to shore up the airlines now that travel has plummeted, and $150 billion for other industries. The details, of course, will be hotly debated. But as the Washington Post points out, “The president and many of his conservative allies rose to power on the strength of a grass-roots movement forged in opposition to the bank bailouts during the 2008 financial crisis and President Obama’s subsequent economic stimulus package.” It was easy to hate TARP, since big and reckless banks got bailed out, with no one going to jail, while ordinary Americans lost their homes and jobs. But the virus is just as much an existential threat to financial stability, or more, and some on the right are calling it an act of God--the better to justify their support of massive government spending. At stake, says the Post, is whether Trump is remembered as Herbert Hoover or FDR. The paper quoted one White House official as saying Trump “doesn’t give a [expletive]” about the plan’s impact on the federal debt. “It’s all about the markets and the economy for him. It’s all about the jobs numbers.” And politically, most Americans would probably agree. The debt seems a far-off and abstract concern. But while a massive bailout (or stimulus or other euphemism) is a virtual certainty, there will be a debate about the role of government. Is sending people $2,000 checks more than a Band-Aid? How small does a small business have to be to get aid? Should the airlines, like the car industry a decade ago, be limited to loans that have to be repaid? Jonah Goldberg, in the Dispatch, says that “every five minutes, someone on Twitter or TV says that this crisis proves the need for government, as if the opposite view dominated public life. It doesn’t.” Virtually everyone on the right, the conservative pundit says, believes the feds should go full steam ahead in a pandemic. “This is one of most infuriating rhetorical sleights-of-hand in ideological debates: Take an example of a problem the government should deal with, and then claim it proves that there is no problem the government shouldn’t deal with. I want the government to nuke a meteor heading our way. That doesn’t mean I must think we should have a federal minimum wage.” SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES But that argument is for another day. Mistakes were made, in Ronald Reagan’s famous phrase. A Trump administration simulation last year of a killer virus that would start in China “drove home just how underfunded, underprepared and uncoordinated the federal government would be for a life-or-death battle with a virus for which no treatment existed,” says the New York Times. We can and will fight about what happened in the past and what will happen down the road. But politicians are casting their usual beliefs aside over the clear-and-present danger that urgent action is needed right now.

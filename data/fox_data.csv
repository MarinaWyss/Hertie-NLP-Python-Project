"                          VP Pence meets with cruise line executives as 19 coronavirus deaths confirmed in the U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Saturday said the U.S. was engaging in a “whole of America” approach in response to the coronavirus, as he met with cruise line executives and port directors in Florida to discuss if any additional measures need to be taken. “President Trump has no higher priority than the health and safety and well-being of the American people,” Pence said, sitting alongside Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. “It’s the reason why, from the first advent of the coronavirus in America, the president launched a whole of government approach, but as evidenced here today it’s not just a whole of government approach... but it’s really a whole of America approach.” FLORIDA REPORTS 2 DEAD FROM CORONAVIRUS, FIRST KNOWN FATALITIES ON EAST COAST Pence said that the industry had found itself at the ""center"" of America's response to the crisis. He also said efforts were underway to bring the Grand Princess to shore, which has more than 3,500 passengers aboard and has been held off the California coast. Twenty-one people have tested positive for the virus on the ship, and Pence said Saturday that all passengers will be tested and those who have the virus will be quarantined. Pence said the administration has also met with the pharmaceutical industry, nursing home leaders, commercial laboratories and others in an effort to stem the spread of the global virus in America. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE “I speak for President Trump when I say we couldn't be more grateful with the spirit of cooperation from all the American businesses that we’ve engaged and their desire to put the health of America first,” he said. Pence’s remarks come as health officials reported that two people in Florida who tested positive for the virus have died -- making them the first known fatalities outside of California and Washington state. FLA SEN. RICK SCOTT: WE NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE CRUISE INDUSTRY The announcement raised the U.S. death toll from the coronavirus strain to at least 16, including 13 in the state of Washington and one in California, with at least 253 confirmed cases across the country. One of the Floridian deaths was a man with underlying health issues in Santa Rosa County in Florida's Panhandle and the other was an elderly person in Lee County, in the Fort Myers area. In his remarks, Pence highlighted the actions the Trump administration has taken, including declaring a public health emergency, suspending travel from China and now screening 100 percent of all of those who take direct flights from Italy and South Korea. He also praised the “yeoman’s work” by Health and Human Services in expanding testing for the virus. Trump signed an $8.3 billion spending bill this week, significantly higher than the $2.5 billion the administration had initially requested from Congress. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Pence also emphasized that for most Americans, the risk remains low -- noting that the risk is higher for the elderly who already have serious underlying health issues. “The risk of contracting the coronavirus for the average American remains low,” he said. “That being said, we are going to continue to lean into this effort, to call on industry, to call on every agency of government to deal with it.” Fox News’ Caleb Parke and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

"                          Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders battle for the Democratic presidential nomination ahead of the Michigan primary; Fox News senior political correspondent Mike Emanuel reports. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on Saturday expressed doubt that Democratic presidential primary rival Joe Biden can “generate enthusiasm” due to the support he is getting from dozens of billionaires -- while promising to back the former vice president if he is the nominee. “The American people are disgusted with billionaires buying elections. We believe in democracy, one person one vote, not billionaires spending hundreds of millions of dollars ” Sanders told supporters in Dearborn, Mich. “I just don't think that Joe Biden can generate enthusiasm when you got 60 billionaires contributing to his campaign,” he said to boos. DEMOCRACY 2020 DIGEST: BIDEN PRESS SECRETARY SAYS SANDERS IS 'LYING' He went on to accuse Biden's backers of running “ugly” ads against him. The two men have trained their sights on each other after most other candidates have pulled out of the race -- with only Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, as the third remaining candidate. “When you've got, Joe Biden has a Super PAC with billionaires putting money into that Super PAC and right now our campaign has taken on a Super PAC running ugly negative ads against us all over the country,” Sanders said. After Biden scored major wins on Super Tuesday, restoring his status as frontrunner, Sanders has sought to draw a bigger distinction between them -- casting doubt on Biden’s ability to fight for the American people. “At the end of the day, people understand that if you're taking lots of money from billionaires, you’re not going to be there standing up for the working class and the middle class of this country,” he said. MODERATE DEMS BREATHE SIGH OF RELIEF AFTER SUPER TUESDAY BLUNTS SANDERS However, he also said he would support Biden if he got the nod from the Democratic Party, something that Biden has also said about Sanders. ""Because we know how important it is to beat President Trump,"" Sanders said. The remarks indicate the race for the nomination is intensifying. The self-described democratic socialist has targeted Biden since before Super Tuesday, but that has increased since Biden swept 10 of the 14 Super Tuesday states. This week, Sanders accused Biden of supporting banning openly gay Americans from serving in the military when he was in the Senate. Biden campaign national press secretary Jamal Brown responded by saying Sanders was “lying.” “[Biden] is on record saying he didn't have an issue with gays & lesbians in the military,” he said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP With 125 pledged delegates at stake, Michigan is the biggest prize among the six states holding primaries on Tuesday, March 10. Missouri, Mississippi, Washington State, Idaho and North Dakota also hold contests. Sanders told reporters on Thursday: ""Michigan is where we'll spend a bit of our time."" Fox News' Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.

"                          Former Vice President Joe Biden rallies supporters at a Super Tuesday event in Los Angeles, California. The Democratic primary took a dramatic turn on Super Tuesday, with Joe Biden winning at least eight states to continue his comeback story. At the same time, Bernie Sanders took home at least four states, including a win in delegate-rich California, to set up a showdown between the two in the primaries ahead. Maine and the key state of Texas remained extraordinarily close. Preliminary data from surveys in eight states conducted as part of the Fox News Voter Analysis sheds light on why the Super Tuesday results shook out the way they did – though these numbers may change slightly as more results come in.  Biden’s resounding win on Saturday in South Carolina gave him a much-needed boost and pushed fellow moderates Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg out of the race. Klobuchar, Buttigieg, and former presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke all endorsed Biden at an event in Dallas on Monday night, bolstering the sense of a campaign gathering steam.  BIDEN SURGES TO VICTORY ACROSS SUPER TUESDAY MAP, AS SANDERS CLAIMS DELEGATE PRIZE IN CALIFORNIA Late-deciding voters clearly bought into the idea that Biden was still in the game. More than a quarter of voters in each state said they made up their minds in the last few days – including more than half of those in Minnesota. Biden won late deciders by at least 15 points in every state but California, and by roughly 30 points or more in Virginia, Alabama, Minnesota, and North Carolina.  Sanders’ main sources of strength continue to be young and very liberal voters. He won better than four-in-10 voters under age 30 in each Super Tuesday state, topping out at 60 percent in a trio of states. Similarly, Sanders won at least four-in-10 of those who called themselves “very liberal” in each state.  By contrast, Biden’s base was seniors and, to a lesser degree, political moderates. He won at least four-in-10 voters over age 65 in every state except California, Colorado, and Massachusetts.  Among both seniors and moderates, Mike Bloomberg’s presence in the race appears to have complicated Biden’s path to victory. Roughly two-in-10 seniors in each state (except Minnesota and Massachusetts) backed the former mayor, and he picked up roughly 15 percent of the moderate vote or more in each state.  The Sanders campaign invested heavily in outreach to the Latino community, and it paid off in the states with the largest Hispanic populations. Biden narrowly edged Bloomberg as Latinos’ second choice.  Sanders’ strength among Latinos was balanced by Biden’s success with black voters. Biden won roughly half of the black vote (or better) in every state except for California (36 percent). Sanders’ best performance among black voters was 26 percent in North Carolina, followed by 24 percent in California.  Biden won white voters in Alabama, Virginia, and Minnesota; Sanders won whites in Colorado, and the two were deadlocked (or nearly so) in the remaining states.  Whites without a college degree went for Sanders by double-digit margins in Colorado and backed Biden by 11 percentage points in Alabama and 15 points in Virginia. The margins among this group in the other states were razor-thin.  The best groups for Bloomberg tended to overlap directly with sources of Biden’s strength: seniors, blacks, and political moderates. Biden’s late surge, however, effectively pushed Bloomberg off the map – the billionaire got less than two-in-10 late-deciding voters in each state.  Adding to Bloomberg’s difficult night was a failure to connect on his signature issues. Despite committing a considerable amount of his personal fortune to gun control and combating climate change, he won no more than two-in-10 voters who prioritized those issues in each state. Similarly, Bloomberg’s attempt to position himself as the candidate most likely to beat President Trump fell short – in each state, he got 20 percent or less among those who said beating President Trump was a very important quality for their nominee.  Most Super Tuesday voters – six-in-10 in most states, with a high of 73 percent in Minnesota – said it was important to them that a woman be elected president in their lifetime. Elizabeth Warren won 29 percent of these voters in Massachusetts, but still lost her adopted home state. In each other state, she won less than a quarter of those who wanted to see a female president in their lifetime.   Issues and policies As in the early primary states, more Super Tuesday voters wanted a candidate who would bring fundamental change to the political system than one who would restore it to the way it was before the Trump administration. That was particularly true in California and Colorado, two of the best states for Sanders.  At the same time, about six-in-10 voters wanted a candidate offering practical, centrist policies over one promising bold liberal ideas – even in more liberal states like California.   Biden won “restore” voters in each state, while Sanders won “change” voters everywhere except for Alabama (where they went for Biden). Similarly, voters wanting centrist policies opted for Biden in each state, and those seeking bold liberal ideas went for Sanders everywhere save Alabama (where, again, Biden won).  Despite divisions about the tone and tenor of their candidates’ approaches, Democrats were largely united in their opinions on key issues and policies. Health care topped voters’ issue list, with at least one-third in each state citing it as the most important issue facing the country. The economy and jobs was second in most of the Southern states (cited by roughly two-in-10 voters). Outside of the South, voters were more likely to mention climate change as their second-place concern (between 26 percent in California and 32 percent in Colorado).  On health care, more than eight-in-10 voters in each state favored a public option approach, while roughly two-thirds in each state backed a Sanders-style single payer plan.  Primary voters also broadly agreed on taxing the use of carbon-based fuels (support ranged between 62 percent in Alabama and 87 percent in Minnesota), marijuana legalization (72 percent in Virginia and Texas to 84 percent in Colorado), and reducing the criminal justice system’s focus on low-level offenses (78 percent in Alabama to 85 percent in Colorado). Fully nine-in-10 primary voters in Colorado and California favored limiting the amount of money presidential candidates and campaigns could spend, while support for the idea was slightly lower in Texas (85 percent) and Alabama (78 percent).  Democrats divided? Majorities of voters in each state would be satisfied if Biden, Sanders, or Warren were the eventual nominee. Overall satisfaction was slightly higher for Biden (ranging between 58 percent in Colorado and 81 percent in Alabama) than for Sanders (a low of 55 in Virginia and a high of 67 in California) or Warren (60 in Virginia to 71 in Colorado).  It was a different story for Bloomberg, as satisfaction ranged from a low of 39 (Colorado and Minnesota) to a high of 61 (Alabama). In five states, majorities would be dissatisfied if he captured the nomination. Across all states, nearly half of Biden and Bloomberg voters would be dissatisfied with Sanders as the nominee, while roughly six-in-ten Sanders supporters would be dissatisfied with Biden. Majorities of Warren voters would be satisfied with either Biden or Sanders as the nominee.  Sanders’ voters’ dissatisfaction could be amplified by concerns about the fairness of the nomination process. While roughly two-thirds of Super Tuesday voters overall had confidence in the process, a majority of Sanders voters felt the process was unfair.  Roughly three-quarters of voters (or more) in each state said they would definitely support the Democratic candidate in November against Trump, with Minnesota voters showing the most party solidarity (84 percent).  In several key swing states, however, two-in-ten voters said their decision in November would depend on who won the Democratic nomination. Warren voters were the most likely to say they would support the Democrat regardless of who won; Sanders and Bloomberg supporters were the least likely. Still, at least three-quarters of each candidate’s supporters said they would back the eventual nominee no matter what.  Texas and California The two largest prizes of the night – Texas and California – were a study in contrasts. Sanders was dominant throughout California, with Biden a distant second and both Bloomberg and Warren hovering around the 15 percent viability threshold for delegates. In Texas, on the other hand, Sanders and Biden were neck-and-neck, with Bloomberg lurking in third and Warren a distant fourth.  In California, Sanders led among most demographic groups, with the exception of moderates (with whom Biden led by 6 points), voters ages 45 and over (Biden +7 points) and black voters (Biden +12 points).  Sanders’ strongest groups in California – as they were across the country – were young voters, very liberal voters, and Latinos. He also won nearly four-in-ten voters without a college degree.  Biden’s strength with late-deciding voters helped him hold down Sanders’ delegate gains out of the Golden State.  Perhaps the most competitive – and consequential – battleground of the night was Texas, where Bloomberg played a major role. White voters split between the two leaders (27 percent for Biden and 25 for Sanders), while Bloomberg picked up 17 percent and Warren 13 percent. Sanders nearly doubled Biden’s support among Latinos, and Biden returned the favor by dominating among black Texans. Warren was unable to attract significant nonwhite support in the state.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Texans were much more likely to favor a public option approach to health care (87 percent) than single payer (63 percent) – and yet more felt Sanders would be best able to handle health care than Biden.  Methodology The Fox News Voter Analysis, conducted in partnership with The Associated Press, provides a comprehensive look at voting behavior, opinions and preferences as America votes. On Super Tuesday, surveys were conducted in Alabama, California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. The surveys were conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago the week before the primaries, concluding as polls closed. Interviews were conducted in English or Spanish. The survey is based on interviews with a random sample of registered voters drawn from the state voter file. In California, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Texas, and Virginia, these probability sample results were supplemented by interviews with self-identified registered voters recruited from nonprobability online panels. The sample sizes for the surveys ranged from 1,168 (Alabama) to 3,976 (California), with margins of sampling error ranging between plus or minus 4.9 and 3.0 percentage points.

"                          Some Republicans are reportedly growing concerned about the virus' impact on the stock market and Americans' sense of security heading into the election; reaction and analysis on 'Outnumbered.' By a 20-point margin, voters say the Trump administration has mostly succeeded at stimulating the economy: 51 percent think that and 31 percent believe he has mostly failed. In addition, by a 19-point margin, more think the administration has mostly succeeded at creating jobs (50 percent succeeded, 31 percent failed). These are two of nine national priorities the latest Fox News Poll asks voters about.  The findings indicate success in some areas, while others need improvement -- including security. CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS The poll, released Friday, also finds more voters say they are better off than they were four years ago (35 percent) than worse off (24 percent).  The largest number, however, feels their situation is about the same (40 percent).  Nearly three times as many Republicans (58 percent) as Democrats (19 percent) say they are better off today. The president’s worst rating is on unifying the country: 59 percent say Trump has mostly failed (19 percent mostly succeeded).  Almost as many think he has mostly failed at improving race relations (55 percent), and many say the same about improving health care (50 percent failed). Voters are less than wowed with the job Trump has done on his “drain the swamp in Washington” promise -- 48 percent call that a failure (21 percent succeeded). Views are more mixed on security issues.  On making the country safer, voters say the administration has mostly failed by 7 points (38 succeeded, 45 failed). And despite the expansion of the U.S.-Mexico border wall, voters divide over whether Trump has been effective on his signature issue of border security (40 succeeded, 42 failed). On handling the Islamic extremist group ISIS, voters split:  39 percent mostly succeeded vs. 38 percent mostly failed. For comparison, voters believed the Obama administration had mostly failed on many of these same priorities as his term started to wind down. In January 2016, majorities gave failing grades for stimulating the economy (51 percent mostly failed), improving health care (53 percent), making the country safer (58 percent), improving race relations (59 percent), and handling ISIS (65 percent). In general, 47 percent of voters approve of Trump’s job performance and 52 percent disapprove.  That is a tad better than last month when it was 45-54 percent (January 2020).  The president’s best rating continues to be 48 percent approve vs. 47 percent disapprove in February 2017, soon after his inauguration.  His record low was 38 percent approval in October 2017. Fully 89 percent of Republicans are happy with Trump’s performance. And, his job approval stands at a record high of 14 percent among Democrats. Overall, a majority of voters approve of how Trump’s handling the economy (54 approve, 42 disapprove) -- yet a majority disapproves on health care (38 approve, 53 disapprove). Poll Pourri -- Most voters are at least somewhat confident the federal government is prepared to deal with the coronavirus (74 percent).  A smaller majority feels confident U.S. intelligence agencies are prepared to deal with the Russian government trying to interfere in the next presidential election (68 percent). -- On the Senate impeachment trial, voters approve of Trump’s acquittal (50-44 percent). -- Views split on Trump’s recent presidential pardons.  Forty-nine percent think they were an abuse of pardon power, while 43 percent call them “fairly typical.”  In February 2001, 55 percent said pardons by former President Clinton were an abuse of power and 32 percent said typical. -- Voters remain unhappy with lawmakers in Washington:  26 percent approve of the job Congress is doing and 65 percent disapprove. -- Nearly half of voters, 49 percent, disapprove of Trump’s tweeting.  That’s more than double the 19 percent who approve.  Another 28 percent “wish he’d be more cautious.” Conducted February 23-26, 2020 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,000 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones.  The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points for all registered voters.

"                          Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Capitalism beats socialism by a two-to-one margin in the latest Fox News Poll. By a 26-point spread, voters have a more positive than negative view of capitalism (56 favorable - 30 unfavorable). The opposite holds true for socialism, where sentiment is net negative by 30 points (28 favorable - 58 unfavorable). CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS That’s almost exactly where things stood a year ago, despite the popularity of Sen. Bernie Sanders', I-Vt., presidential campaign. The Democratic presidential frontrunner says “billionaires should not exist,” yet 76 percent of voters overall and 67 percent of Democrats think it’s a good thing people can become billionaires in the United States. For many though, there are limits.  Voters agree by a 56-35 percent margin the government “should increase taxes on the wealthiest individuals so that nobody gets to be too rich.”  A decade ago, it was the reverse: 40 percent favored increased taxes and 55 percent disagreed. Billionaires, generically, garner somewhat negative ratings in the poll (35 favorable - 44 unfavorable).  Mere millionaires are a bit more popular (41 favorable - 39 unfavorable).  One in five voters is unable to give an opinion of either millionaires or billionaires. Views among groups Twice as many Democrats (40 percent) as Republicans (15 percent) feel positively about socialism. Republicans (67 percent) are more likely than Democrats (50 percent) to have a favorable view of capitalism. Men are 26 points more likely than women to have a favorable view of capitalism (70 vs. 44 percent).  That gender gap disappears on socialism, as roughly equal numbers of men (29 percent) and women (27 percent) feel positively. Voters ages 65 and over are far more likely than those under age 35 to like capitalism (72 vs. 44 percent), and young voters are more than twice as likely as seniors to have a favorable view of socialism (35 vs. 16 percent). CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Democratic primary voters who back Sanders in the nomination race have a net positive view of socialism by 17 points (49 favorable - 32 unfavorable), and a net negative view of capitalism (by 15 points) and billionaires (by 59 points).  Some 74 percent of Sanders’ supporters have an unfavorable opinion of billionaires.

"                          As young voters embrace Sen. Bernie Sanders' promises of 'free' college and health care, a new study shows only 16 percent of millennials are 'financially literate.' Bernie Sanders pushes Joe Biden out of the frontrunner spot for the Democratic nomination, capturing a record 31 percent support among primary voters in a new Fox News Poll. This is the first 2020 Fox national poll that finds Biden not leading the Democratic race. The survey also finds a marked increase in the number of voters who think President Trump will win the election. Sanders has gained 8 percentage points since January in the nomination race, while Biden drops into second with 18 percent, down 8 points. Close behind is Mike Bloomberg at 16 percent, up 6 points since last month and triple his 5 percent in December. Pete Buttigieg comes in at 12 percent (up 5), Elizabeth Warren at 10 percent (down 4), and Amy Klobuchar at 5 percent (up 2). This is the first Fox News poll with five candidates in double digits. It was conducted Sunday through Wednesday. Sanders, notably, was the most attacked candidate during Tuesday’s contentious presidential debate in South Carolina. Sanders performs well with groups across the board, with an extra boost from young voters, self-described liberals, whites without a college degree, and those looking for change. Biden is strongest among women over age 45, voters who regularly attend religious services, and those who long for a return to the pre-Trump era. CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS The nomination race looks almost the same when narrowed to Democratic primary voters in the 14 Super Tuesday states: Sanders remains on top with 30 percent, followed by Bloomberg at 18 percent, Biden 17 percent, Warren 11 percent, and Buttigieg and Klobuchar each get 8 percent. Overall, majorities of primary voters think Sanders (65 percent), Bloomberg (57 percent) and Biden (56 percent) can beat Donald Trump. Since December, the number believing Sanders can win is up 5 points (was 60 percent). But Democratic voters’ faith in most of the other candidates is shaken since December. The portion saying Biden can win is down 21 points (from 77 percent), while Warren (-22 points) and Buttigieg (-12) also saw declines. Democrats remain divided on central questions facing their party. By a 10-point margin, more want a nominee who will fundamentally change how the political system works (52 percent) than want someone who will restore the system to pre-Trump administration (42 percent). There is a similar divide over whether they prefer a nominee who is a pragmatist or a visionary: by a 9-point margin, more are looking for a candidate who will pursue “practical centrist” policies (49 percent) than want someone who will pursue “bold liberal” plans (40 percent). Sanders leads by more than 30 points among “bold liberal” voters, while support among “practical centrist” voters splinters: Biden (21 percent), Bloomberg (20 percent), Sanders (19 percent) and Buttigieg (15 percent). Those wanting change prefer Sanders by more than 20 percentage points. Biden is the favorite for those wanting to hit reset, although he leads by a narrower 9-point margin. It’s important not to overstate these differences, as Sanders is the second choice among restore voters and Bloomberg comes in second among change voters. More primary voters think Biden’s policies are realistic (67 percent), than say the same about Bloomberg (57 percent realistic), Buttigieg (55 percent), Sanders (53 percent), Warren (49 percent), and Klobuchar (44 percent). When asked if there is a candidate primary voters could not support, Bloomberg and Sanders (18 percent each) have the largest number saying they would refuse to vote for them in November, followed by Biden and Warren (13 percent apiece) and Tulsi Gabbard (10 percent). Forty-five percent of Democratic primary voters say they would vote for any one of the current candidates over Trump. There is no hurry to narrow the field. Fifty-four percent of primary voters want candidates to stay in the race even if they failed to finish in the top three in any of the early contests. What’s more, by a 50-38 percent margin, they say the Democratic Party should have the flexibility to nominate someone else if no candidate has a majority of delegates at the convention. Sanders, as the candidate currently best positioned to win the most delegates, thinks the candidate with the delegate lead should win the nomination, even if it isn’t a majority. The other top candidates support flexibility if no candidate has a majority. In general, 75 percent of all Democratic primary voters and 67 percent of Sanders supporters feel confident the Democratic Party’s process of picking a nominee is fair. 2020 general election Among all voters, all six Democratic candidates tested top the president in trial ballots. Trump trails Biden and Bloomberg by 8 points and Sanders by 7. Those are the only leads outside the poll’s margin of error.  Warren (+3 points), Buttigieg (+3) and Klobuchar (+1) are barely ahead. And in each instance, there are enough undecided/third-party voters to move the race either way. Forty-two percent would vote to re-elect Trump if the election were today. That’s up from 38 percent in May 2019 and the largest share he’s received to-date. On the other side, a majority of 52 percent would vote for someone else. That puts the president underwater by 10 points, an improvement from a net negative of 16 points in May 2019. At the extremes: 32 percent would definitely vote for Trump vs. 45 would definitely back someone else. Despite those findings, 56 percent think Trump will be re-elected. That’s up from 44 percent in October.  Expectations increased among Republicans (+9 points) and Democrats (+16). Eight years ago, 52 percent thought former President Obama would be re-elected. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Poll Pourri Biden (50 percent) and Sanders (49 percent) have the highest favorable ratings -- and have more who view them positively than negatively. Biden’s net favorability rating is best (+4 points), followed by Sanders (+2), and Buttigieg (+1). Klobuchar is net neutral, and the ratings for Warren (-4), Steyer (-7), Bloomberg (-8), and Trump (-11) are underwater. Voters favor giving everyone the option to buy into Medicare by a 67-23 percent margin and making minor changes to Obamacare by 58-32 percent. A 49-percent plurality opposes getting rid of private insurance and moving to a government-run health care system (42 percent favor). Among Democratic primary voters, 76 percent favor the public option (Buttigieg’s position), 74 percent favor mostly keeping Obamacare (Biden), and 56 percent favor a government-run plan (Sanders and Warren). The poll, released Thursday, asks Democratic primary voters if any candidates may not be physically healthy enough to carry out the job of president. Sanders is the most frequently mentioned at 30 percent, followed by Biden at 16 percent. Nearly one in five Sanders supporters thinks he may lack what it takes to do the job physically. Among all voters, 63 percent think presidential candidates should be required to release their full medical records, and 70 percent say the same about tax returns. When it comes to Democratic primary voters, there is an even larger desire for full disclosure: 72 percent want to see full medical records and 90 percent want to see tax returns. Conducted February 23-26, 2020 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,000 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points for all registered voters and 4 points for Democratic primary voters (507).

"                          Fox News has confirmed the departure of Corbin Trent from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's re-election campaign. He was the campaign’s spokesman and former leader at Justice Democrats. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is coming under fire after urging illegal immigrants to participate in the upcoming census -- with opponents saying her language was “anti-American,” ""We're all going to get mailed a prompt to fill out the census in the next two weeks or so,"" she said Thursday on “Late Night with Seth Meyers.” ""And so I think what’s really important is that we all fill this out. It happens once every 10 years.” FACEBOOK DROPS TRUMP ADS AFTER PELOSI CITES CENSUS CONFUSION “Every single person, no matter your documentation status, no matter your housing status, income, etc., is to be counted,” she said, before assuring viewers that the data included is “completely confidential” and not shared with other agencies. “So don’t worry if you’re having a creative living situation, it’s not going to be told to your landlord or anything crazy like that,” she added. The census is a once-a-decade population count that determines how $1.5 trillion in federal spending is allocated, and also how many congressional seats each state gets. The Census Bureau notes that it counts “our population and households” in the U.S. The remarks come after she shared a video, distributed by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's office, and emphasized that ""you will NOT be asked about immigration status."" Ocasio-Cortez’s remarks angered at least one New York lawmaker -- who said her rhetoric was “anti-American.” “Illegal aliens should not be counted equally to law-abiding Americans and legal immigrants – plain and simple,” Assemblyman Mike LiPetri said in a statement.  “When radical left-wing politicians like AOC make such statements, she sends a message to all Americans and legal immigrants that it doesn’t matter if you work hard and play by the rules, we’re going to prioritize criminals and those here illegally over you.” AOC CLAIMS BIDEN 'OVERPERFORMED' SUPER TUESDAY BECAUSE HIS CAMPAIGN FACED 'LOW EXPECTATIONS'  Ocasio-Cortez’s push for those in the country illegally to fill out the census is part of a broader fight over the census, which saw the Trump administration try to include a question on citizenship in the census. That move was scrapped after the Supreme Court ruled against the administration, with Democrats claiming that even asking the question could spook illegal immigrants from filling out the entire census. The question however, did not ask whether a non-citizen was here illegally or not, just whether they were a citizen. A number of Democratic states and localities, including New York and California, are estimated to have large numbers of illegal immigrants and the amount of funding they receive -- something determined by the census -- rests in part of how many of them they can get to fill out the form. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump in July last year accused Democrats of trying to “conceal the number of illegal aliens in our midst.” This is part of a broader left-wing effort to erode the rights of the American citizen,” he said. “And it’s very unfair to our country.”    ",         Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calls on illegal immigrants to fill out 2020 census,         2020-03-07T091229-0500,https://foxnews.com/politics/ocasio-cortez-illegal-immigrants-2020-census,Fox
"                          Democratic presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard addresses preparations that need to be made to protect the U.S. from a coronavirus outbreak. The only woman remaining in the 2020 race for the White House is calling on her party's top two competitors to help pressure the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to allow her to participate in an upcoming presidential debate in Phoenix. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, is now one of only three Democratic candidates still running for president. On Super Tuesday, March 3, she walked away with two delegates from American Samoa, which would have helped her qualify in the previous debate, held Feb. 25 in Charleston, S.C. However, the DNC released a new requirement for the March 15 Phoenix debate. Participants for that contest must have at least 20 percent of the pledged delegates, which means only the two leaders -- former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. -- qualify. 'THE VIEW' LAUGHS OFF TULSI GABBARD AFTER SHE WON DELEGATE ON SUPER TUESDAY: 'PUT A FORK IN IT!' On Friday night, Gabbard took to social media and appealed to Biden and Sanders to let her join them on the debate stage once again. ""@JoeBiden @Bernie Sanders I’m sure you would agree that our Democratic nominee should be a person who will stand up for what is right. So I ask that you have the courage to do that now in the face of the DNC's effort to keep me from participating in the debates,"" Gabbard tweeted. She then called out the DNC for changing the debate requirements to allow Mike Bloomberg onto the debate stage. ""To keep me off the stage, the DNC again arbitrarily changed the debate qualifications. Previously they changed the qualifications in the OPPOSITE direction so Bloomberg could debate. I ask that you stand w/ me against the DNC’s transparent effort to exclude me from the debates. #LetTulsiDebate,"" she said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The hashtag #LetTulsiDebate trended on Twitter throughout Friday evening. Gabbard has not appeared on at a Democratic debate since November.

"                          Sen. Elizabeth Warren expresses disappointment that little girls will have to wait four more years for the chance of a female president; reaction and analysis on 'Outnumbered.' Now that Elizabeth Warren has bowed to the inevitable, the Biden-Bernie matchup is either a battle for the soul of the Democratic Party…or the typical dust-settling of a conventional race. That is, one establishment candidate, a veteran, battle-scarred establishment type who is not terribly exciting, and an insurgent candidate, a colorful, more ideological provocateur who makes followers swoon. In this view, the voters who gave Joe Biden 10 Super Tuesday victories were simply coming home after flirting with two dozen potential dates. Biden was the safe, dependable choice for those whose main goal is beating President Trump—and that includes some who feel more affinity with Bernie Sanders. Usually, this plays out over a couple of months, and the race is hardly over. But in the space of four days, Biden transformed his fortunes and, in what had seemed unthinkable, passed Sanders in the delegate count. It didn’t hurt that Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg closed ranks behind him, followed by Mike Bloomberg, or that he was lifted aloft by his first sustained burst of positive press. But the breadth of his coalition—African-Americans, working classes, suburban dwellers and older voters—suggests he was always a likely front-runner once folks were convinced he could win. BLOOMBERG INVESTMENT BOMBS AS PRESS BELATEDLY BOOSTS BIDEN It was, as John Harris puts it in Politico, “a signal that not all the old ways of thinking about national politics are defunct in an age of disruption.” The 2008 contest was the exception, with newcomer Obama toppling semi-incumbent Hillary. But Harris recites the history: “Jimmy Carter in 1980, Walter Mondale in 1984, Bill Clinton in 1992, John Kerry in 2004, Hillary Clinton in 2016—the party has ultimately coalesced over the more consensus-oriented politician in the spring after a flirtation with more flamboyant or purely ideological insurgents.” And that means Gary Hart, Paul Tsongas, Howard Dean, Bill Bradley—and Bernie last time—didn’t win. The very factors that made Biden seem like a plodding war horse—nearly four decades in the Senate, eight as vice president, lots of political baggage—were why a majority of Democrats have so far decided that he’d be a reassuring choice as commander-in-chief. And that brings us to why the race is now down to a 77-year-old Democrat, a 78-year-old independent and a 73-year-old president. When Warren emerged from her Cambridge home and made some humble withdrawal comments, MSNBC reporter Ali Vitali asked: “I wonder what your message would be to the women and girls who feel like we’re left with two old white men to decide between?” (We’re left with.) SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES Warren replied that “one of the hardest parts of this is all those pinky promises and all those little girls who are going to have to wait four more years. That’s going to be hard.” The problem with this question is that Warren was riding a wave of favorable press and voter support when she was leading the polls last fall. Then she started making mistakes, from embracing and then fudging on Medicare for All to migrating from an unabashed progressive to a “unity” candidate. Of course there is sexism in the press and in society. But that didn’t stop Hillary from winning the nomination and the popular vote. Warren, Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand didn’t drop out because America is wedded to male septuagenarians; they just failed to get sufficient traction. Here’s a different view of the former Harvard law professor from Megan Garber in the Atlantic: “Warren had something about her, apparently: something that galled the pundits and the public in a way that led to assessments of her not just as ‘strident’ and ‘shrill,’ but also as ‘condescending.’ The matter is not merely that the candidate is unlikable, these deployments of condescending imply. The matter is instead that her unlikability has a specific source, beyond bias and internalized misogyny.  “Warren knows a lot, and has accomplished a lot, and is extremely competent, condescending acknowledges, before twisting the knife: It is precisely because of those achievements that she represents a threat. Condescending attempts to rationalize an irrational prejudice…When I hear her talk, I want to slap her, even when I agree with her.” Running for president is brutal; only one person prevails in each party. Everyone’s personality is mocked; Joe Biden is routinely portrayed as a rambling, forgetful geezer. In “SNL” terms, Kate McKinnon is Warren the know-it-all; Larry David is Bernie the ranting relative; Alec Baldwin is Trump the know-nothing. Maybe it comes down to the fact that this was the first presidential campaign for Warren, who got into politics less than a decade ago, but the second for Sanders and the third for Biden. The former veep will need that experience, if he’s the nominee, going up against another political newcomer who has come to dominate American politics.

"                           Mike Bloomberg didn’t need one of his fancy Wall Street terminals to interpret the data that he got shellacked on Super Tuesday. And faster than anyone might have imagined, he got out of the race and backed Joe Biden. Bloomberg’s return on his $500-million investment: not much, though he’ll always have American Samoa. It was a stark reminder that money—even massive amounts of money on a scale never before seen in American politics—can’t buy a nomination. And an equally dramatic reminder that the press makes the same mistake every four years, conflating big bucks with political strength. Bloomberg, who never recovered from that Vegas debate debacle, was smart to call it quits, and his considerable fortune will certainly help Biden, especially if the former VP prevails against Bernie Sanders and has to battle the Trump machine. BIDEN SHOCKS THE PUNDITS, AGAIN, WITH SURPRISINGLY STRONG SUPER TUESDAY Politicians and the press always overstate the importance of money and organization. They matter, but not as much as the candidate and the message. That mistake has been made again and again, with candidates ranging from Phil Gramm to Jeb Bush to, well, Donald Trump, who was massively outspent in 2016. And how many pieces did I have to read about Elizabeth Warren’s awesome field operation? That didn’t stop her from being clobbered again and again, even finishing third in her home state of Massachusetts. When the press was portraying Biden as having one foot in the political grave, Bloomberg became the new savior—especially for many in the party who feared a Bernie nomination would be disastrous. And it’s true that as he blitzed the airwaves, he moved up in the polls. But Bloomberg was damaged by reports of things he’d done and said as a Republican, especially stop and frisk, and was less than impressive when he finally came out from behind the curtain to do a couple of interviews. In the end, the money didn’t matter. Voters deserted him en masse as soon as Biden seemed viable again. In a way, the former vice president ought to thank the press for performing last rites on his struggling campaign. It made his victories in Virginia, Massachusetts, Maine, North Carolina, Alabama, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Minnesota and Texas seem absolutely miraculous. The way in which so much of the press had declared Biden finished, kaput, washed up after Iowa and New Hampshire was nothing short of journalistic malpractice. “Drop out, Joe Biden. New Hampshire proves you are done,” said a Business Insider headline. SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES Everyone knew those two small, largely white states were rough terrain for Biden, and yet it didn’t matter. Even after his blowout win in South Carolina, many journalists said he couldn’t possibly be competitive in 14 states because he didn’t have the money and organization (there are those words again). It didn’t matter. A strong ground game is great when a candidate is connecting. But the dogs have to like the dog food. The two-day interval between South Carolina and Super Tuesday turned out to be perfect for Biden. Peaking at the right time is political gold. Another week would have given him more time to raise money, but also more time for Sanders to sharpen his attacks and for unexpected events to intervene. The candidate, of course, deserves substantial credit. Biden got better as he grew in confidence. He was often photographed, by design, interacting with average votes, not a Sanders or Bloomberg specialty. His two victory speeches were tightly scripted rather than an attempt to thank everyone in the room. But the press should be careful about this latest swing of the pendulum. Biden is the same guy who not long ago was being derided for stupid gaffes, shaky debate performances and meandering speeches. Sanders still has a passionate following and substantial number of delegates. The same journalists who said Biden couldn’t win shouldn’t fall into the trap of now saying he can’t lose.

Hillary Clinton may not have yet given her endorsement for her party’s presidential nomination this year, but that doesn’t mean she’s not weighing in on who she thinks will be the best – or the worst - candidate to go up against President Trump this fall.  Clinton, who lost the 2016 general election to Trump, said of  Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders: ""I do not think he's our strongest nominee against Donald Trump.” But she stopped short of throwing her endorsement behind former Vice President Joe Biden. Speaking on CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS,” Clinton – who faced a surprisingly tough nomination in 2016 from Sanders – has been highly critical of the Vermont lawmaker throughout the 2020 election season, but this is the former secretary of state’s first comments since the race to take on Trump basically became a two-man contest following Super Tuesday.  HILLARY CLINTON UNLEASHES ON BERNIE SANDERS IN NEW DOCUMENTARY: 'NOBODY LIKES HIM' While Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, has yet to exit the race, the Democratic nomination is now firmly a battle between Sanders and Biden. Clinton’s slam on Sanders comes just days after she called his campaign and platform “baloney” and ripped his claims that he is taking on Washington elites. ""He was a career politician,” she said during an interview on ABC's ""Good Morning America.""  “It's all just baloney and I feel so bad that people got sucked into it.” In regards to Biden, Clinton did not come out with an outright endorsement of the former vice president, but praised the “coalition” he is building and the momentum he has generated since his wins on Super Tuesday. “I think what Joe’s victories on Super Tuesday showed is that he is building the kind of coalition that I had basically,” Clinton said. “It’s a broad-based coalition. I finished, you know, most of the work I needed to do for the nomination on Super Tuesday, and then it kind of lingered on — and I think Joe is on track to doing exactly the same thing — putting together a coalition of voters who are energized.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Clinton, who last month said she would support Sanders should he win the Democratic nomination, told CNN that she hopes Sanders and his backers would go in for Biden should the former vice president secure the Democratic nomination. “I hope so because his failure and the behavior of a lot of his top aides, and certainly many of his supporters — up to the convention, at the convention, and even up to Election Day was not helpful,” she said, recalling Sanders’ actions during the 2016 election. She added: “I had thought we would unify, that's what we'd always done before and that's what I expected. I certainly tried to do that when I ran against Barack Obama and worked very hard for him.”    ",         Hillary Clinton says Sanders would not be Dems strongest candidate to beat Trump,         2020-03-08T122846-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/hillary-clinton-says-sanders-would-not-be-dems-strongest-candidate-to-beat-trump,Fox
"                          Reaction from former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise. Hunter Biden should be held in contempt for continuing to defy a court order to turn over his financial information, flaunting his lack of ""respect"" for the legal process and undermining the interests of the child he has previously refused to support or even acknowledge, according to a blistering new filing from the mother of Biden's child in an ongoing paternity case. The motion comes as Joe Biden has surged to front-runner status in the Democrats' presidential primary amid new questions over whether his son may have corruptly benefited from his father's position as vice president. The case threatens to surface new information about the younger Biden's overseas dealings in Ukraine, China and elsewhere during the Obama administration -- and his father's apparent knowledge of those arrangements. ""After months of hiding, one has to wonder if the reason Hunter Biden continues to defy the court is because there are financial documents that could shed light on his father’s massive conflicts of interest as vice president,"" Republican National Committee (RNC) spokesman Steve Guest told Fox News on Sunday. The filing from 28-year-old Lunden Alexis Roberts' legal team wastes little time in charging that Hunter Biden ""continues to act as though he has no respect for this Court, its orders, the legal process in this state, or the needs of his child for support."" It argues that the court ""should take some action that will make the defendant follow court orders and a believer in the rule of law."" Specifically, Biden has not turned over information concerning his address, financial institutions he or his businesses use, a list of all the companies he ""currently owns or in which he has an ownership interest and the state in which those companies are incorporated,"" or a list of ""all sources of income for the past five years."" HUNTER BIDEN'S SCANDALS EXPLAINED: UKRAINE, COCAINE, AND MORE       U.S. Vice President Joe Biden (L) waves as he walks out of Air Force Two with his granddaughter Finnegan Biden and son Hunter Biden at the airport in Beijing December 4, 2013. The younger Biden's business dealings are coming under scrutiny as House Democrats push forward with an impeachment inquiry into President Trump for allegedly pressuring the Ukranian President to investigate the Biden family for political gain.      (Reuters) Additionally, Biden has failed to produce a list of all ""employers for the past five years,"" an unredacted copy of his tax returns, deeds for properties he owns, and tax documents for companies in which he has any ownership interest. The previous judge in the case, Don McSpadden, said in December that Biden was ""going to have to provide at least the last three years of tax returns."" A Dec. 4 court order required Biden to turn over at a minimum ""five most recent paystubs or five previous years"" of tax returns; and a later order mandated both sides provide ""their personal tax returns for the past five years; and ... any and all financial documents and information showing money or monies they received in the past five years."" Independence County Circuit Court Judge Holly Meyer, who now oversees the case, has said those orders are still in effect. Biden's conduct is ""willful and contemptuous,"" according to Roberts' lawyers, and he should be ordered to appear in person at a March 13 hearing to explain why he should not be held in contempt. WHOOPS: BIDEN CAMPAIGN TOUTS UKRAINE ACTIVIST WHO CALLED HUNTER'S ACTIONS 'VERY BAD' Meyer had previously ordered Biden to appear in person for the same reason, but Biden temporarily avoided being held in contempt when he agreed to pay an undisclosed monthly child support amount. At the time, Meyer noted she ""lacks sufficient information"" about Biden's finances to determine the appropriate child support totals, and delayed contempt proceedings until March 1. Those proceedings now appeared likely to resume this week. The younger Biden is also slated to appear at a deposition on March 11, despite his efforts to quash the deposition and obtain a protective order (“He needs to make himself available unless his hair is on fire,” Meyer said during a conference call with the attorneys on the case last month, according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.) ""After months of hiding, one has to wonder if the reason Hunter Biden continues to defy the court is because there are financial documents that could shed light on his father’s massive conflicts of interest as vice president."" The New York Times reported last week that the 50-year-old Hunter Biden is spending his time attempting to pass himself off as a painter in a rented $12,000-per-month hideout in Hollywood Hills while driving a Porsche. The paternity case established that Hunter Biden was the father of Roberts' baby after a DNA test. Roberts had argued that Biden was essentially an absent father, and the younger Biden had repeatedly denied paternity until the DNA test. Republicans, and even some left-of-center commentators and career State Department employees, have said Biden appeared to be trading on his access to his father as part of a career of illicit dealings -- raising the prospect that the financial documents could shed additional light on their accusations. Top Republican senators recently requested travel records from the Secret Service that might shed light on Hunter Biden's dealings in China, which President Trump has long said merit a state investigation. The paternity dispute has presented headaches for the elder Biden ever since a court filing showed that DNA results indicated he was now a grandfather. Joe Biden tangled with a Fox News reporter on camera when asked about that development last November. ""I'm wondering if you have a comment on this report, and court filing, out of Arkansas, that your son Hunter just made you a grandfather again,"" Fox News’ Peter Doocy asked. ""No, that’s a private matter and I have no comment,"" Biden fired back before attacking the reporter. ""Only you would ask that,"" Biden said. ""You're a good man. You're a good man. Classy."" TENSIONS FLARE IN CONGRESS, AS GOP REP BRINGS UP HUNTER BIDEN'S COCAINE USE Campaigning late last year, Biden has also lashed out at voters -- even appearing to call one man ""fat"" for bringing up issues with his son's possible corruption and questioning his fitness for office. “You’re a damn liar, man,"" Biden said. “Let’s do push-ups together here, man. Let’s run. Let’s do whatever you want to do. Let’s take an IQ test. ... No one has said my son has done anything wrong.""

"                          Coronavirus task force member Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, joins Chris Wallace on 'Fox News Sunday.' Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Sunday that while he hopes it doesn’t come to it, the government could shut down certain sections of the country hit hard by the coronavirus. Speaking during an interview on “Fox News Sunday,” Fauci said that “anything is possible” when asked if measures like those currently being imposed in Italy could be enacted in the U.S. to help prevent the continued spread of the coronavirus.  “I don’t think it would be as draconian as nobody in or nobody out,” Fauci said. “But if we continue to get cases like this, particularly at the community level, there will be what we call 'mitigation,' where we have to essentially do social distancing, keep people out of crowded places, take a look at seriousness, do you really need to travel, and I think it’s particularly important among the most vulnerable.” He added: “You know, you don’t want to alarm people, but given the spread we’ve seen, you know, anything’s possible. And that’s the reason why we’ve got to be prepared to take whatever action is appropriate to contain and mitigate the outbreak.” CORONAVIRUS: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW Fauci’s comments shortly after Italian Minister Giuseppe Conte signed a decree restricting the movements of about a quarter of the country's population in a bid to limit contagions at the epicenter of Europe's outbreak. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo joins 'Sunday Morning Futures' to discuss the growing number of coronavirus cases in his state. “For Lombardy and for the other northern provinces that I have listed there will be a ban for everybody to move in and out of these territories and also within the same territory,"" Conte said. ""Exceptions will be allowed only for proven professional needs, exceptional cases and health issues.” Around the world, more and more countries were bracing for a big increase in virus cases. Western countries have been increasingly imitating China – where the virus first emerged late last year, and which has suffered the vast majority of infections — by imposing travel controls and shutting down public events. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Fauci also cautioned people most at risk of dying from the coronavirus or complications relating to it – the elderly and people with preexisting conditions – to keep their distance from places where they could contract the virus, and to avoid any unnecessary travel. “If you are an individual that has an underlying condition, particularly an elderly person with an underlying condition, right now you should start to distance yourself from the risk: crowds, getting on a plane, on a long plane trip, and above all, don’t get on a cruise ship,” he said. “That is a health issue.”  In waters around the world, the virus outbreak has left the cruise ship industry largely in disarray.  The Grand Princess cruise ship, where 21 people have tested positive for the virus, was heading Sunday to Oakland, Calif., after idling off San Francisco for days. It is expected to arrive Monday. Americans on the ship will be transferred to facilities around the country for testing and isolation, officials have said, but it's not yet clear what will happen to passengers from other countries. The ship had a cluster of almost 20 infections during an earlier voyage, which led to one death.  Another cruise ship has been in quarantine on the Nile River in Egypt with 45 confirmed virus cases. Malaysia and Malta turned away two other ships with no confirmed cases amid virus fears. While the global death toll has risen past 3,400, more people have now recovered from the virus than are sickened by it. As of Saturday, nearly 90,000 cases have been reported in Asia; more than 8,000 in Europe; 6,000 in the Mideast; about 450 in North America, Latin America and the Caribbean, and fewer than 50 cases reported so far in Africa. While many scientists say the world is clearly in the grips of a pandemic — a serious global outbreak – the World Health Organization isn’t calling it that yet, saying the word might spook the world further. The virus is still much less widespread than annual flu epidemics, which cause up to 5 million severe cases around the world and up to 650,000 deaths annually, according to the WHO. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is urging older adults and people with severe medical conditions to ""stay home as much as possible"" and avoid crowds.

The video was retweeted by President Trump on Saturday. The clip showed Biden in Missouri. Biden is seen addressing a crowd and the video ends with the former vice president saying, ""We can only re-elected Donald Trump."" The video got the attention of Twitter. The social media giant marked the video with a ""manipulated media"" tag, TechCrunch reported. It was the first time that the company took the step, but unveiled the policy last month.

Perhaps the most memorable one was when he was in Des Moines and talked to the Iowa Asian and Latino Coalition.

"                          366 confirmed coronavirus deaths in Italy as they implement a sweeping quarantine, 16 million people under lockdown. Amy Kellogg reports. Congress is a reactive body. It responds to events.  And here, with coronavirus, we have an “event.”  We’ve written about the late British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan in these spaces before. The story is somewhat apocryphal. But Macmillan is said to have proclaimed that “events” are the most important factor when setting the course of public policy. Macmillan wasn’t wrong.  STEVE HILTON: STOP THIS RECKLESS REACTION And that means that Congress and the Trump Administration will likely craft a series of measures to react and respond to coronavirus in the coming months. LATEST NEWS ON CORONAVIRUS The $8.3 billion measure okayed last week was mostly for health, readiness and vaccine development. Other measures will likely address everything else. The easy word to bat around is a “stimulus” measure. In the most conventional sense, a “stimulus” is an infusion of government cash to jolt the economy. President Obama and Congressional Democrats modeled their 2009 stimulus plan to bolster the economy after the “New Deal” of the 1930s. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and lawmakers authored a series of measures which changed fiscal regulations, created Social Security and launched a massive development of public works projects to respond to the Great Depression. It’s too early to completely understand the scope of coronavrius and if a “stimulus” could be required here.  But we are hearing chatter on Capitol Hill about tax cuts. More government spending. Rebates for travel. But unlike in 2009, it’s doubtful any legislation will simply be an infusion of cash centered around economic recovery. Infrastructure was a hallmark of the much-maligned 2009 stimulus plan engineered by Democrats. There are regular emanations from the Trump Administration about infrastructure. “Infrastructure week” is a running joke in Washington. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle would love to pursue an infrastructure package. Yet nothing ever happens. The Trump Administration and some Republicans on Capitol Hill spoke about “tax reform 2.0” long before coronavirus hit. But those discussions largely went nowhere. That’s partly because Democrats now control the House. There is also consternation in high tax states about how well voters received the new tax policy of a couple of years ago. There’s also a question whether Republicans really want to wade into the tax reform waters again. So let’s review what Congress did the last time it faced a fiscal crisis. In February, 2009, Congress approved what was initially billed as $787 billion economic stimulus package to shock the American economy into action after the Great Recession. The price tag of the measure eventually ballooned to $831 billion.  The Democratic House and Senate passed the plan in the first month of President Obama’s presidency. It consumed months to develop such a plan – and a new President. No Republicans in the House supported the bill. Only three GOP senators voted yea: Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Arlen Specter (R-PA). Granted, Congress responded with a $700 billion relief measure to salvage the economy in the fall of 2008 to cover losses in the financial sector. After an epic, initial failure in the House of Representatives (costing the market what was then it’s biggest point drop in a single day, in synchronicity with the bill blowing up on the House floor), Congress finally approved Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) in October, 2008. That was an immediate response because the economy teetered on the brink of collapse that autumn. But, it took a new Congress, a new President and time to assemble a full-blown stimulus package. Also, Congress and President Obama assembled a number of measures after the fiscal meltdown. There was the controversial “Dodd-Frank” financial re-regulation plan. There was also a federal rescue of the American auto industry. A contemporary package to respond to coronavirus would likely be an amalgam of tax credits for small businesses and travel, loans or even “bailouts” for damaged sectors of the economy (airlines?) and health assistance. There could also be a reduction of the “payroll tax.” If you go to the dictionary and look up the word “donnybrook,” you’ll see a picture of the internal fight waged between Congressional Republicans, over extending the payroll tax holiday in late 2011. This was a pitched, Christmastime battle royale. GOP fiscal hawks duked it out with fellow Republicans who wanted to trim taxes. And, it unfolded around the holidays because, as you know, only the zaniest worst-case scenarios unfold on Capitol Hill at Christmas.  In other words, it’s hard to have it both ways: keep taxes low yet reduce deficit spending. So what are the politics with a possible stimulus measure for coronavirus? Some Republicans are close to pushing for action – but up to a point. Those same Republicans who balked at President Obama’s stimulus plan will likely excoriate Democrats who championed the one in 2009 – and vice versa. Still, some Congressional Republicans may be tentative to call for major action, worried it would send a message of desperation and undercut President Trump. The optics of this are going to be complicated. Congressional maneuvering sends a message that lawmakers are on the case. But it can also sound alarm. At his briefing this week, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) seemed cool to cutting taxes. “I don’t know that talking about additional tax cuts now, other than for political purposes, is what we ought to be focused on,” said Hoyer. “What we ought to be focused on is what is our medical response to this.” When pressed further, Hoyer introduced an additional factor which could complicate a stimulus: Obamacare. The Maryland Democrat argued that the Trump Administration and Congressional Republicans are still trying to undo Obamacare. The Supreme Court will soon hear yet another case to overturn Obamacare. “It is ironic,” said Hoyer “That the administration says it wants to fight a major health challenge that is keeping America healthy.” Democrats are concerned that persons with “junk” health insurance plans won’t stay home from work because if they fall ill they lack adequate coverage. That could spread coronavrius. So, there could be an opportunity for Republicans to finally undercut Obamacare and replace it with something else to help respond to coronavirus.  Or…. It could mean that Republicans have to halt their attacks on Obamacare amid coronavirus and Obamacare expands far beyond its current form. Or…it could mean that coronavirus prompts a major recalibration of the American health care system.  Public opinion - and the death toll - will play heavily in all of this. If people don’t think they have sufficient health care in the coronavirus era, other options could look good. That may not mean “Medicare for All.” But it may alter the GOP’s decade-plus crusade to repeal and replace Obamacare. On Sunday night, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) took issue with the administration offering “tax breaks for major corporations” to cope with coronavirus. Pelosi and Schumer outlined a different set of proposals: Paid sick leave. Enhanced unemployment insurance. An expansion of food “security programs,” such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the food initiative for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). Protections for frontline health care workers. Widespread testing for coronavirus. Reimbursements for non-covered coronavirus-related costs. And, measures to guard against price gouging. “The administration must move more quickly and seriously to address the severe impacts of the coronavirus on the financial security of America’s families,” said Pelosi and Schumer. These are all proposals which will cost money. They will all likely require legislation. And, to become law, they have to go through President Trump. GET THE FOX NEWS APP The legislative response will take a while to sort out. Look at how long it took Congress to counter some aspects of the 2008 financial crisis. There may be immediate steps Congress takes as certain demands become evident. But the “big stuff” is likely a long way off.

Donald Trump Jr. wants to debate Hunter Biden in a bid to prove the former vice president’s son has financially benefited more than him from their fathers’ government positions. President Trump’s eldest son offered up the idea in an “Axios on HBO” interview that aired Sunday night. “You know what will be great, I’ll let you host it. You moderate a debate between Hunter Biden and myself,” he told Axios co-founder Jim Vandehei. Trump Jr. added: “We can go full transparency. We show everything, and we can talk about all of the places where I’m supposedly grifting, but Hunter Biden isn’t.” Republicans, including Trump, have repeatedly scrutinized Hunter’s lucrative position on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma while his father, Joe Biden, was vice president. “Hunter Biden, his father becomes VP. All of a sudden he goes over to Ukraine and he’s making 83 grand a month,” Trump Jr. said in the interview. Trump Jr. claimed Sunday night that, unlike Hunter, he has not profited from his father’s presidential position.

"                          366 confirmed coronavirus deaths in Italy as they implement a sweeping quarantine, 16 million people under lockdown. Amy Kellogg reports. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, issued a statement Sunday revealing that he had interacted with an attendee at last month’s Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) who had tested positive for the coronavirus -- and as a result, he'll stay at home until two weeks have passed since the encounter. Shortly afterward, Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., announced he and three additional staffers were “under self-quarantine” after “sustained contact” with a virus patient. Officials with the American Conservative Union (ACU), which hosted CPAC, said Saturday the attendee had been exposed before the conference, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed his case.       Sen. Ted Cruz R-Texas, speaks to the media during the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.      (AP) Cruz said his interaction with that individual “consisted of a brief conversation and a handshake.” “I’m not experiencing any symptoms, and I feel fine and healthy. Given that the interaction was 10 days ago, that the average incubation period is 5-6 days, that the interaction was for less than a minute, and that I have no current symptoms, the medical authorities have advised me that the odds of transmission from the other individual to me were extremely low,” Cruz said.  CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE  He added that he did not meet the CDC criteria for self-quarantine because testing was not effective before symptoms manifest.  “The medical authorities explicitly advised me that, given the above criteria, the people who have interacted with me in the 10 days since CPAC should not be concerned about potential transmission,” Cruz said.  The senator said he has decided to remain at his home in Texas until 14 days have passed since the CPAC interaction because of how frequently he interacts with his constituents and “to give everyone peace of mind.”  CONNECTICUT GOVERNOR ANNOUNCES STATE’S FIRST CORONAVIRUS CASE  “Everyone should continue to treat this outbreak seriously and be driven by facts and medical science. We need to continue to be proactive in mobilizing resources to combat this outbreak—including the $8.3 billion in emergency funding we provided last week—and I encourage everyone to follow the recommendations of the CDC and other health professionals in protecting their own health and welfare, as well as the health and welfare of those around them,” Cruz said.  Gosar later tweeted: “I am announcing that I, along with 3 of my senior staff, are officially under self-quarantine after sustained contact at CPAC with a person who has since been hospitalized with the Wuhan Virus. My office will be closed for the week.” He added, “We are all asymptomatic and feel great. But we are being proactive and cautious.” Also Sunday, ACU officials said they were working with the Maryland Department of Health since the CPAC conference was held in that state.

"                          Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders battle for the Democratic presidential nomination ahead of the Michigan primary; Fox News senior political correspondent Mike Emanuel reports. Bernie Sanders' campaign is accusing Joe Biden of pushing for a sit-down format at the March 15 presidential primary debate in Phoenix, according to a new report that highlights mounting concerns over the 77-year-old former vice president's stamina and cognitive ability. Sanders' team raised the alarm about the sit-down format during a Friday call with CNN, which is set to moderate the debate along with the Democratic National Committee (DNC), Politico reported this weekend.  All previous primary debates this cycle have required candidates to stand at podiums; and during his one-on-one debates with Hillary Clinton in 2016, Sanders stood alongside her. ""Why does Joe Biden not want to stand toe-to-toe with Sen. Sanders on the debate stage March 15 and have an opportunity to defend his record and articulate his vision for the future?"" senior Sanders advisor Jeff Weaver told the outlet. The Biden campaign denied it had anything to do with the proposed new format. Biden has stood for each of the previous debates, but the upcoming one-on-one with Sanders is expected to be a more grueling and taxing event. (Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, will be excluded from the debate under new DNC rules requiring that each candidate have received a large number of delegates.) ""We will participate in whatever debate CNN chooses to stage: standing, sitting, at podiums or in a town hall,"" Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield told Politico. ""The problem for the Sanders campaign is not the staging of the debate, but rather, the weakness of Sen. Sanders’ record and ideas."" Bedingfield added that during the joint call with CNN and the campaigns, the Biden team ""agreed to the format that CNN proposed"" -- and that after Sanders objected, the Biden ""campaign agreed to a modification of that format that CNN proposed, to compromise with both campaigns."" The nature of that modification was unclear, but the DNC has suggested the format would change to become more intimate. Sit-down-style debates are not unprecedented; in 2012, Biden sat across from then-Rep. Paul Ryan at a vice presidential debate, and in 2008, the-candidate Barack Obama debated Clinton at a roundtable. HUNTER BIDEN DEFYING COURT ORDER TO TURN OVER FINANCIAL DOCS, CONTEMPT MOTION SAYS ""After 10 debates, the DNC worked with its network partners to adapt the March debate to the smaller field of candidates and to give voters more of a voice. This format provides candidates longer response times, and for the first time, will incorporate questions from undecided voters in the audience,"" DNC spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said. Thus far, Biden's debate performances have been largely underwhelming, analysts have said. He has suggested that most Americans owned ""record players"" and could use them to connect with children, declared that half of the country has been killed by gun violence since 2007, and baffled audience members by telling them to ""go to Joe 30330."" Republicans, meanwhile, have made Biden's possible health issues a major part of their messaging, and there were signs that the attacks weren't simply political. Obama's longtime doctor, for example, has flatly remarked in an interview with The Washington Examiner that Biden was ""not a healthy guy."" ""He's not in bad shape for his age, but I wouldn't say he’s in outstanding health,"" Dr. David Scheiner said last year, after reviewing partial medical records. ""Could I guarantee he won't have issues for the next four years? He has a lot of issues that are just sort of sitting there."" On Sunday, Trump mocked Biden's gaffe-marked, seven-minute speech in St. Louis the day before. TRUMP EMBRACES MUDDLED BIDEN 'ENDORSEMENT' During the brief address, Biden declared:  ""If you want a nominee who will bring this party together, who will run a progressive, positive campaign, and turn, turn this primary from a campaign that's about negative attacks into one that's about what we're for -- because we cannot get -- re-elect -- we cannot win this re-election -- excuse me. We can only re-elect Donald Trump -- if, in fact, we get engaged in this circular firing squad here. Gotta be a positive campaign, so join us.""

Joe Biden is racking up endorsements from former rivals and Democratic insiders, but a gaffe-riddled 7-minute speech on Saturday in St. Louis, Missouri, led President Trump to tweet out an edited clip that appears to have the former vice president endorse the current commander in chief. During the brief address, Biden, 77, declared: ""If you want a nominee who will bring this party together, who will run a progressive, positive campaign, and turn, turn this primary from a campaign that's about negative attacks into one that's about what we're for -- because we cannot get -- re-elect -- we cannot win this re-election -- excuse me.

Biden also bizarrely described himself as an ""O'Biden Bama"" Democrat, transposing his name and the name of his old boss. The muddled remarks led to renewed concerns from both Republicans and left-of-center commentators that Biden may be mentally unfit for the presidency. On Twitter, President Trump jokingly took Biden's speech as a mangled endorsement. ""I agree with Joe!"" Trump wrote, captioning a video of the address that edited out the second part of Biden's remarks. The tweet was part of a larger effort by Republicans to point out what they see as one of Biden's fatal vulnerabilities, along with his son's possible corruption. Trump suggested at a Fox News Town Hall last week that Biden isn't fit for office, saying that Biden's numerous gaffes were indicative of a competency issue.

But he also said 150 million people were killed with guns, and that he was running for the U.S. Senate -- there's something going on there."" With Biden set to potentially deliver a knockout blow to Bernie Sanders during Tuesday's Michigan primary, some doctors and even some left-of-center commentators are agreeing with the president's assessment.

""Stop. Pause. He can't be president,"" Rogan said. ""Listen, we can't play any games here folks. This is a really old man who can't talk."" On Sunday, Glenn Greenwald countered accusations on social media that he was mentioning what he called Biden's ""obvious cognitive issues"" only to help Sanders, noting that he has been writing about them for months. Journalist Aaron Mate has pointed out the relative lack of scrutiny for Biden in the network media, which with some exceptions has largely steered clear of probing the former vice president's overseas dealings or his possible cognitive issues. ""When's the last time Joe Biden sat for a live, unedited interview like Bernie did this week w/ Maddow?"" Mate asked. ""For example, I'd love to know what Biden said here after claiming Hunter got his $80K/month Ukraine board gig because 'he's a really bright guy.' But it's clearly edited."" And, last summer, The New York Times reported that many Biden associates and insiders were doubting with ""significant unease"" whether he would be too old to serve as an effective candidate. Meanwhile, reports have emerged that the format for the next presidential debate will allow Biden and his opponent to sit down -- prompting the Sanders campaign to suggest Biden is getting favorable treatment. “Why does Joe Biden not want to stand toe-to-toe with Sen. Sanders on the debate stage March 15 and have an opportunity to defend his record and articulate his vision for the future?” Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ senior adviser, told Politico. For now, though, Biden is largely basking in the support of a mostly unified Democratic Party -- even picking up the endorsement of Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who just last year accused Biden of supporting what she called racist policies that affected her personally. ""There is no one better prepared than Joe to steer our nation through these turbulent times, and restore truth, honor, and decency to the Oval Office,"" Harris said in a statement Sunday. ""He is kind and endlessly caring, and he truly listens to the American people."" Harris joins Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke, ex-New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohion, former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, and former Maryland Congressman John Delaney in endorsing Biden.

Kevin McCarthy breaks down how the White House is tackling the outbreak and how Congress is planning to deal with the threat of a slowing economy. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, D-Calif., continued the Republican assault on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., for his comments last week about Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. McCarthy said that Schumer’s comments, which came as the court heard arguments in a high-profile abortion case, were meant to influence the justices’ decisions and that Democrats in the Senate should replace the New York senator as their party’s leader. “He's standing before the Supreme Court trying to influence the outcome in America,” McCarthy said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures.” “We believe we encourage the exchange of ideas not to the idea that you're going to intimidate.” McCarthy added: “If I was a Democrat in the Senate, I would have changed my leadership if this was what was happening.” MCCONNELL CALLS SCHUMER'S RESPONSE TO SUPREME COURT NOT 'MUCH OF AN APOLOGY' Schumer has taken heat following his comments at a pro-choice rally last week, where he called the case, June Medical Services LLC v. Russo, the first ""major"" abortion case since President Trump's court picks have been on the bench. The dispute, dealing with restrictions over who can perform abortions, involves a Louisiana law similar to one in Texas that the court ruled unconstitutional in 2016, before either Trump justice was on the Supreme Court and before conservatives held a 5-4 majority. ""I want to tell you, Gorsuch. I want to tell you, Kavanaugh. You have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price!"" Schumer warned. ""You won’t know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions."" Video of the remarks quickly circulated on social media, with Republicans casting the warning as a threat against two sitting Supreme Court justices. Schumer attempted to walk back his statements, claiming his words didn't come out right because of his state of mind at the time.  “I’m from Brooklyn. We speak in strong language. I shouldn’t have used the words I did, but in no way was I making a threat,” he said on the Senate floor Thursday. “I feel so deeply the anger of women all across America about Senate Republicans and the courts working hand in glove to take down Roe v. Wade."" Hours after the rally where Schumer appeared, Chief Justice John Roberts issued a statement singling out the senator's comments.  CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP “Justices know that criticism comes with the territory, but threatening statements of this sort from the highest levels of government are not only inappropriate, they are dangerous,"" Roberts said.  It was only the second time the chief justice has responded to criticism of individual judges. In 2018, Roberts rebuked Trump for the president's criticism of an ""Obama judge."" But Roberts has otherwise stayed silent, including in recent weeks when Trump questioned the impartiality of Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor, and of U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who presided over the trial and sentencing of Trump ally Roger Stone. Senate Republicans did not criticize those comments. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., himself came under criticism in August when his campaign tweeted a photo of signs that were shaped like tombstones with names of Judge Merrick Garland, President Obama's nominee to replace Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, and Democrat Amy McGrath, McConnell's likely 2020 election opponent.

The son of former vice president and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has faced accusations of corrupt behavior from both sides of the political aisle, and played a starring role in the recently concluded impeachment proceedings against President Trump. The younger Biden's distinct scandals are best understood in rough chronological order because Republicans have argued that Biden's apparently irresponsible behavior only made it more likely that his later sweetheart gigs were obtained not through merit, but because of connections that he could monetize. In 2008, both The New York Times and The American Spectator highlighted Hunter Biden's sweetheart gigs while his father rose in political prominence. The articles, written as Barack Obama and John McCain vied for the White House, found that Hunter Biden received consulting fees from the financial services company MBNA from 2001 to 2005 — while his father, then a senator, was pushing successfully for legislation that would make it harder for consumers to file for bankruptcy protection. The precise amount of the payments was unclear, but a company official once said Hunter Biden was receiving at least a $100,000 per year retainer, the Times reported. Hunter Biden, now 49, previously had been an executive at MBNA beginning in 1996, but the consulting fees came years after his departure from the company as a full-time employee. Aides to then-presidential candidate Barack Obama at the time denied that any lobbying had occurred, and insisted the payments were proper. However, that explanation was immediately treated with skepticism. The Trump campaign recently posted a contemporaneous interview in which an incredulous Tom Brokaw asked Joe Biden whether it was ""inappropriate"" for the then-senator to have his son ""collecting money from this big credit card company while you were on the [Senate] floor protecting its interests."" Hunter Biden's previous work as an executive at MBNA from 1996 to 1998 also has raised what critics called red flags. Rachel Mullen, a former senior personal banking officer at MBNA from 1994-2001 who later went into Republican politics, tweeted that managers referred to the younger Biden as ""Senator MBNA"" after he was hired into a lucrative management-prep track right after he graduated from Yale Law School. An MBNA source who previously worked at the company told Fox News that other employees heard Hunter Biden boasting that his salary was unusually high, even for the management-prep track — which was widely seen in the company as a way to groom and pamper well-connected executive candidates with powerful family members.

(AP Photo/Elise Amendola)       The source said Biden's ""Senator MBNA"" nickname was not politically motivated, but rather reflected a widely held belief among managers – who did not work directly with Biden – that he essentially was engaged in lobbying. The Bidens' connections with MBNA apparently ran deep. In a January 2008 article entitled ""The Senator from MBNA,"" columnist Byron York recounted how then-MBNA vice chairman John Cochran paid ""top dollar"" for Joe Biden's home in February 1996, just prior to his Senate reelection bid, and that ""MBNA gave Cochran a lot of money – $330,000– to help with 'expenses' related to the move."" The $1.2M sale was a ""pretty darned good deal for Biden,"" York wrote, noting that ""Cochran simply paid Biden’s full asking price"" even though the ""house needed quite a bit of work; contractors and their trucks descended on the house for months after the purchase."" Asked how Cochran and Biden found each other for the sale, an MBNA spokesperson told York: ""That’s a very personal question."" Aside from MBNA during this period, the younger Biden worked at a lobbying firm and served on the board of Amtrak -- a prestigious role he apparently obtained through his connections, although Democrats claimed he deserved the post because he traveled regularly on trains. ""Hunter Biden has spent a lot of time on Amtrak trains. Like his father, like our congressman, Mike Castle, and myself, Hunter Biden has lived in Delaware while using Amtrak to commute to his job as we commute to our job in Washington almost every day of the week,"" Democratic Delaware Sen. Tom Carper said at a hearing on Biden's nomination to the Amtrak board in June 2006. ""You know, you learn a lot about what could work and what would work better at Amtrak by riding trains and talking to the passengers, the commuters, the passengers, the folks who work on the trains and make them work every day."" In 2014, Hunter was kicked out of the military after testing positive for cocaine. The Navy said that Biden, a former lobbyist who worked at a private equity firm, was discharged barely a year after he was selected for his part-time position as a public affairs officer in the Navy Reserve. Two people familiar with the situation quickly told the media that Biden was discharged because he failed a drug test in 2013. The Wall Street Journal first reported Biden’s discharge and failed drug test. TREASURY COMPLIES WITH HUNTER BIDEN INQUIRY, HANDS OVER SENSITIVE DOCS An attorney by training, Biden applied to join the Navy Reserve as a public affairs officer and was selected in 2012 — one of seven candidates recommended for a direct commission for public affairs. A board of senior Navy officers interviewed Biden before making the recommendation.       Photo exclusively obtained by Fox News shows Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, and Devon Archer golfing. The elder Biden has denied discussing his overseas business dealings with his son.       Because he was 42 at the time, he needed a special waiver to be accepted. Cmdr. Ryan Perry, a spokesman for the Navy, said Biden had been assigned to the Navy Public Affairs Support Element East, based in Norfolk, Va. Hunter Biden and and his friend Devon Archer joined the natural gas company Burisma Holdings board in April 2014. Biden apparently cannot speak Ukrainian and had no relevant natural gas experience. Joe Biden has acknowledged on camera that in spring 2016, when he was vice president and spearheading the Obama administration's Ukraine policy, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire top prosecutor Viktor Shokin. At the time, Shokin was investigating the notoriously corrupt Burisma Holdings — where Hunter's role was especially lucrative. The vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion in critical U.S. aid if Shokin was not fired. ""Well, son of a b---h, he got fired,"" Biden joked at a panel two years after leaving office. Shokin himself had already been widely accused of corruption. WHOOPS: BIDEN CAMPAIGN TOUTS UKRAINE ACTIVIST WHO CALLED HUNTER'S ACTIONS 'VERY BAD' Critics alleged Hunter Biden might have been selling access to his father, who had pushed Ukraine to increase its natural gas production. Government officials have raised similar concerns. During the House impeachment proceedings, a career State Department employee testified that he had flagged Hunter Biden's apparent conflict of interest, but was told essentially not to bother the vice president's office. ""Impossible to justify $50k/month for Hunter Biden serving on a Ukrainian energy board w zero expertise unless he promised to sell access,"" political scientist Ian Bremmer previously tweeted. Joe Biden has said he never discussed his son's overseas business dealings -- an assertion seemingly contradicted by both his son and a photo exclusively obtained by Fox News. “I know I did nothing wrong at all. Was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is a swamp in many ways? Yeah,"" Hunter Biden said in an exclusive sit-down with ABC's Amy Robach at his Los Angeles home last October. TENSIONS FLARE IN CONGRESS, AS GOP REP BRINGS UP HUNTER BIDEN'S COCAINE USE He acknowledged he may not have gotten the job were it not for his connections to the vice presidency. In the ABC News report last year which also delved into the Bidens' China dealings, journalist Tom Llamas called it ""strange"" that Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings, widely accused of corruption, had appointed Hunter Biden to its board of directors -- and agreed to pay Hunter Biden's company ""more than a million dollars a year."" ""Hunter -- a lawyer, who had just been discharged from the Navy Reserves for testing positive for cocaine,"" Llamas says incredulously. ""He had served on other boards, but had no known experience in Ukraine or natural gas."" Earlier this month, the Treasury Department complied with a Senate inquiry into the younger Biden's business dealings in Ukraine and reportedly handed over highly sensitive financial records and ""evidence of questionable origin."" Top Republican senators recently requested travel records from the Secret Service that might shed light on Hunter Biden's dealings in China, which Trump has long said merit a state investigation. Much of the focus concerns Biden's position as one of nine directors at BHR -- a private-equity company controlled by Chinese government-backed stakeholders. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said the arrangement raised red flags.

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File)       ""In December of 2013, one month after Rosemont Seneca's joint venture with Bohai Capital to form BHR, Hunter Biden reportedly flew aboard Air Force Two with then-Vice President Biden to China,"" the senators wrote. ""While in China, he helped arrange for Jonathan Li, CEO of Bohai Capital, to 'shake hands' with Vice President Biden."" ""Afterward,"" they continued, ""Hunter Biden met with Li for reportedly a 'social meeting.' After the China trip, BHR's business license was approved. Then, in 2015, BHR joined with Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) to acquire Henniges, which was the 'biggest Chinese investment into U.S. automotive manufacturing assets to date.'"" The senators also sought travel records relating to Biden's trips to Ukraine, if any. Last year, Biden stepped down from the board of BHR and said he wouldn't take similar roles if his father won the presidency. The Wall Street Journal reported that BHR Partners filings show that while Hunter was a director of BHR since its founding, he didn't become a shareholder until October 2017. Trump has specifically accused Biden of walking ""out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund.” The Journal reported in 2014 that BHR was trying to raise that much money to invest outside of China, but it's otherwise unclear what the president was referencing. In January of this year Hunter Biden agreed to pay monthly child support retroactive to November 2018, temporarily ending a standoff that began after the judge in his Arkansas paternity case ordered him to appear in person for a hearing to explain why he shouldn't be held in contempt. But, the standoff reignited in March, when Biden apparently failed to meet a court deadline to turn over additional financial documents. Republicans suggested he was hiding evidence of corruption. The matter remains pending. Biden had previously denied paternity, before a DNA test proved otherwise. HUNTER BIDEN FINALLY AGREES TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT FOR KID FATHERED WITH EX-STRIPPER The court redacted the amount of child support that Biden agreed to pay, pursuant to his agreement with plaintiff Lunden Alexis Roberts, who alleged Biden was an entirely absent father. However, Independence County Circuit Court Judge Holly Meyer noted that she ""lacks sufficient information"" to determine the appropriate amount of ""permanent"" child support ""based off the defendant's income,"" and that modifications to the child support owed each month could be made based on additional evidence. Contempt proceedings over Biden's repeated failure to turn over relevant financial documents were only delayed until March 1, and Biden apparently has not resolved the issue. ""After months of hiding, one has to wonder if the reason Hunter Biden continues to defy the court is because there are financial documents could shed light on his father’s massive conflicts of interest as vice president,"" Republican National Committee (RNC) spokesman Steve Guest told Fox News. READ THE ORDER REQUIRING BIDEN TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT The paternity dispute has presented headaches for the elder Biden ever since a court filing showed that DNA results indicated he was now a grandfather. Joe Biden tangled with a Fox News reporter on camera when asked about that development last November. ""No one has said my son has done anything wrong."" ""I'm wondering if you have a comment on this report, and court filing, out of Arkansas, that your son Hunter just made you a grandfather again,"" Fox News’ Peter Doocy asked. ""No, that’s a private matter and I have no comment,"" Biden fired back before attacking the reporter. ""Only you would ask that,"" Biden said. ""You're a good man. You're a good man. Classy."" Campaigning late last year, Biden has also lashed out at voters -- even appearing to call one man ""fat"" for bringing up issues with his son's possible corruption and questioning his fitness for office. “You’re a damn liar, man,"" Biden said. “Let’s do push-ups together here, man. Let’s run. Let’s do whatever you want to do. Let’s take an IQ test. ... No one has said my son has done anything wrong."" The Associated Press contributed to this report.

"                          Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders joins moderators Martha MacCallum and Bret Baier for a Fox News town hall in Dearborn, Michigan. As his struggling campaign seeks a big win in Michigan's Tuesday primary, Bernie Sanders took the stage at a Fox News Town Hall in Detroit and wasted little time in dismissing front-runner Joe Biden as a friend to ""crooks"" -- and former rival Hillary Clinton as a seemingly bitter ex-candidate stuck in the past. ""I always give this guy a hard time,"" Sanders joked at the outset, referring to Fox News Channel anchor Bret Baier, who was hosting the town hall alongside Martha MacCallum. ""This is going to be fun tonight,"" Baier responded. Within minutes, Sanders took aim at the former vice president, saying Biden had ""bailed out the crooks on Wall Street who nearly destroyed our economy 12 years ago."" That $700 billion rescue plan also had the support of then-presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain. Questioned about Biden's recent verbal gaffes and his broader competence, Sanders remarked, ""I'm not here to criticize Joe, but to say that I think the American people at this incredibly complicated and difficult moment in our history, are entitled to thoughtful answers to the crises we face.""       Fox News Channel anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum question Sanders at the Fox News Town Hall on Monday in Detroit, Mich.       ""I'm not gonna go to that level -- that's for people to decide,"" Sanders added, when Baier presented video of Democrats criticizing the former vice president's mental fitness for elected office. ""I’m not going to be making personal attacks on Joe."" The Biden campaign has repeatedly refused Fox News Channel's invitations to participate in a town hall. Separately, prompted by a recent video clip of Clinton claiming that ""nobody likes"" Sanders and that he ""didn't work until he was 41,"" Sanders responded: ""Unlike Secretary Clinton, I don't want to relive 2016. We're in 2020 now."" ""But, what I would say on a good day, is my wife likes me,"" Sanders said to applause. ""But also, if you guys look at some of the polling they do for United States senators, in most cases I turn out to be the most popular senator in the country."" (At the end of the town hall, in response to a question as to who his closest friend is in Washington, Sanders said, ""My wife."") Later, seeking to assure a voter from Russia that his brand of ""democratic socialism"" would not bring widespread poverty and despair to the United States, Sanders said he instead wanted a country more like Denmark, Finland and Sweden. ""What happened in the Soviet Union was not socialism, it was authoritarian communism,"" Sanders said as attendees cheered. ""I'm not an expert on the current economy in Sweden,"" Sanders responded when MacCallum noted Sweden was pushing towards more deregulation and less taxes, and that the population in the U.S. is much larger than that of the Nordic countries. ""They have gone a long way to eliminate poverty, to make sure that all of their people have the basic needs that they need to live good lives."" Sanders said studies have shown that countries like Denmark are among the ""happiest on earth,"" because they provide various free services like college and health care. Other studies, however, have showed that Denmark essentially free-rides heavily from U.S. capitalism, and argue that mimicking their welfare programs may backfire. Sanders also slammed President Trump's response to the coronavirus outbreak -- and said that he would not consider closing the border, no matter what. ""If you had to, would you close down the borders?"" Baier asked, referring to efforts to stop the spread of coronavirus. ""No,"" Sanders replied flatly. He went on to condemn xenophobia and suggest that scientists would need to outline the appropriate approach. Sanders also hit Trump's appointment of Vice President Mike Pence to lead the coronavirus task force and inaccurately claimed that Trump had advised Americans with the virus to head to work. In fact, Trump told Fox News ""Hannity"" that, empirically, some Americans are going to work with the virus and recovering without incident. ""Sadly, we have an administration in Washington that has shown the world that it does not believe in science,"" Sanders said, taking aim at the White House on issues from climate change to health care. ""When you appoint Vice President Pence, an individual who also doesn't much believe in science, what you're telling the whole world is that you're politicizing this issue."" ""I'm not an expert on the current economy in Sweden."" Baier pressed Sanders on the coronavirus response, saying that Trump has in fact appointed numerous experts to address the issue. Sanders responded by mocking Trump's claim to have a ""natural ability"" to address disasters. ""You listen to the scientists; you don't say stupid things,"" Sanders said. ""You don't suggest to people they can go to work."" Sanders returned to his talking points about the wealthiest people not paying their ""fair share"" in taxes, leading MacCallum to probe whether Sanders would reconsider his policies given the ongoing stock market crisis. SANDERS RELEASES DETAILS ON HOW HE'D PAY FOR MAJOR PROPOSALS -- ARE THERE ISSUES? ""I will not become president until January, and the economic situation will be different then,"" Sanders said. As to what he would do if he were president today, Sanders said an ""economic stimulus"" could come in the form of ""invest[ing] in working-class people in good-paying jobs by rebuiling our crumbling infrastructure -- roads, bridges."" He added that ""I'm not here to demonize anybody,"" after MacCallum pointed out that Bill Gates is contributing substantially to coronavirus efforts. At the same time, Sanders said, it was absurd to depend upon the ""generosity"" of billionaires. Then, in a dramatic call-and-response moment with the audience at the town hall, Sanders established that Canada is not a socialist or communist system of government and yet manages to provide government-run health care at a minimal cost to patients. The president, for his part, has derided Canada's health-care system and pointed out that even Canadians complain about their long waiting times, relatively substandard care, and high taxes. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders joins moderators Martha MacCallum and Bret Baier for a Fox News town hall in Dearborn, Michigan. The Vermont senator acknowledged that taxes would go up by 4 percent at a minimum to incomes over $29,000, in additional to more payroll taxes on employers and stock market transaction taxes, but asserted that ""comprehensive"" health care is worth it. Sanders said he wanted a ""modest"" tax on ""Wall Street speculation."" The proposal, according to Sanders' campaign, specifically would place a ""0.5 percent tax on stock trades – 50 cents on every $100 of stock – a 0.1 percent fee on bond trades, and a 0.005 percent fee on derivative trades."" Sanders' campaign has claimed that a ""modest tax on Wall Street speculation ... will raise an estimated $2.4 trillion over ten years"" and, in one fell swoop, make all ""public colleges, universities and trade schools tuition-free ... and cancel all student debt over the next decade."" However, the National Review has likened a tax on so-called ""Wall Street speculation"" to a de facto tax on savings, and asserted the Sanders plan is untested and ""would mean paying $25 to the federal government every time you traded $5,000 worth of stock — or five times what you’d pay the typical online brokerage in fees. ... Over the long term, that imposes serious costs on actively traded funds such as the ones containing many Americans’ retirement funds.""       Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rev. Jesse Jackson wave to the crowd at a rally for Sanders at Calder Plaza in Grand Rapids, Michigan on Sunday, March 8, 2020. Michigan's presidential primary is Tuesday. (Anntaninna Biondo/The Grand Rapids Press via AP)       At the town hall, Sanders alluded to a disputed Yale University study to argue that ""Medicare-for-all"" would save money largely by cutting down on administrative costs. Other nonpartisan estimates have put the cost of Sanders' ""Medicare-for-all"" proposal at over $32 trillion. Baier and MacCallum moderated Sanders’ second Fox News Town Hall of the election cycle. At last April's event, a combative Sanders made no apologizes for his wealth, and acknowledged that his plans would lead to tax hikes for many Americans. Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington will also hold primaries on Tuesday, and a combined 352 delegates will be at stake. Michigan's 125 pledged delegates are perhaps the day's biggest prize and offer Sanders an opportunity to cut down front-runner Joe Biden's current 91-delegate lead. SANDERS HIRES ADVISOR WHO BLAMED AMERICA FOR 9/11 Sanders won the Michigan primary over Hillary Clinton in 2016 after taking a beating on Super Tuesday, but this year, surveys show him down by as many as two-dozen points. Biden tops Sanders 51 percent to 36 percent among likely Democratic presidential primary voters in Michigan, a Monmouth University survey released on Monday showed. An outstanding question going into Tuesday is whether Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who dropped out of the race last week, will endorse Biden or Sanders. So far, she's declined to back either, an especially frustrating development for Sanders, who could use Warren's help in unifying progressives in much the same way Biden has been able to rally moderates. Sanders tells Fox News he wouldn't close US borders during coronavirus-type contagion Sanders has scoffed at suggestions he could drop out if he doesn't win Michigan, but his travel schedule underscores its importance. He canceled a trip to Mississippi and instead made five campaign stops across Michigan since Friday. And he was holding a roundtable in Detroit on Monday with health experts to discuss the spread of the new coronavirus. Sanders has accused Biden of relying on billionaires to finance his campaign but also says he's now running against “the Democratic establishment.” The senator told Fox News on Sunday that he'd win Michigan and repeated that at a rally in Grand Rapids, but he added the major caveat for supporters that he'd only pull it off “if we stick together, we bring our friends out to vote.” FLASHBACK: AT TESTY FNC TOWN HALL, SANDERS MAKES NO APOLOGIES FOR MAKING MILLIONS Sanders won't say if he's personally lobbying Warren for her endorsement. He did manage to secure the backing of Jesse Jackson, who said it was no time for centrist compromise. “With the exception of Native Americans, African-Americans are the people who are most behind socially and economically in the United States and our needs are not moderate,"" Jackson said at Sanders' Grand Rapids rally. “A people far behind cannot catch up choosing the most moderate path.” Still, one of Sanders' highest-profile supporters, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, struck a far more conciliatory tone addressing 10,000-plus on the campus of the University of Michigan on Sunday night, saying, “In order for us to win, we have to grow.”       President Donald Trump gestures while walking on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington on Monday after stepping off Marine One. A “Women for Trump” bus tour has been canceled, the president’s campaign said, citing scheduling conflicts. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)       “We must be inclusive. We must bring more people into this movement,"" she said, urging Sanders supporters to shed “cynicism and exclusion” and “turn with an embracing posture, where all people are welcome in a people's movement.” Sanders is hoping to do well in Washington state on Tuesday, but could face hurdles in Mississippi and Missouri. Sanders' team acknowledges he will also struggle in next week's Florida primary, where the senator's past defense of Fidel Castro looms large. He also could face long odds in Ohio and Illinois — especially if he underperforms in Michigan. Both of those states also vote March 17. The wild card next week could be Arizona, where Sanders will be counting on strong Latino support, which lifted him to victory in California. MARCH 10 PRIMARY PRIMER: THE STATES AND THE STAKES The intricate arithmetic of how delegates are won makes it possible Tuesday for a winning candidate to reap a bigger haul of delegates with a smaller margin of victory than any other night. This gives Biden an opportunity to greatly increase his lead over Sanders or for Sanders to close the gap. Delegates are mostly awarded proportionally in congressional districts. And nearly two-thirds of Tuesday districts have an odd number of delegates up for grabs. When there is an odd number of delegates available, that means one of the two candidates will get more delegates. In districts with an even number of delegates, proportional distribution means that in close races, both candidates get the same number of delegates and that makes it more difficult for Sanders to catch Biden. After March 17, most delegates are in districts with an even number of delegates. Monday's Sanders Fox News Town Hall was the eleventh town hall of the current election season hosted by Fox News and the tenth with a Democratic presidential candidate. FNC’s first town hall with Sanders held the record for the most-watched town hall of the 2020 election cycle with nearly 2.6 million viewers, before Trump's town hall dethroned it with a whopping 4.2 million viewers. Recent Fox News town halls were held with then-Democratic presidential candidates Mike Bloomberg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, both co-moderated by Baier and MacCallum, as well as former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, moderated by Chris Wallace.

"                          'Dr. Oz Show' host Dr. Mehmet Oz joins Harris Faulkner to discuss the coronavirus outbreak on 'Outnumbered Overtime.' Two more Republican lawmakers -- GOP Reps. Doug Collins of Georgia and Matt Gaetz of Florida -- revealed Monday they had contact with the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) attendee who has since been diagnosed with coronavirus, saying they are not experiencing symptoms but will self-quarantine out of an abundance of caution. Both Collins and Gaetz are pro-Trump Republicans who have been with President Trump since CPAC: Collins shook Trump's hand and joined him for a visit to the CDC in Atlanta on Friday. He also met with Trump at the White House last Tuesday, several days after the Feb. 26-29 conference.       President Donald Trump greets Rep.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)       That makes four Republican lawmakers who have said they interacted with the CPAC attendee who tested positive for COVID-19, after announcements over the last day from Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar. Cruz's office released an update on the senator, saying he feels fine: ""Sen. Cruz feels great, has not exhibited any symptoms of the coronavirus in the last 11 days, and is not currently experiencing any symptoms."" CPAC ATTENDEE INTERACTED WITH 'SEVERAL' MEMBERS OF CONGRESS: CAPITOL PHYSICIAN Collins said Monday it was a photograph that led CPAC to determine his interaction with the sick attendee. “This afternoon, I was notified by CPAC that they discovered a photo of myself and the patient who has tested positive for coronavirus,” Collins said in a statement Monday. “While I feel completely healthy and I am not experiencing any symptoms, I have decided to self-quarantine at my home for the remainder of the 14-day period out of an abundance of caution.” He added: “I will follow the recommendations of the House Physician and my office will provide updates as appropriate.” Gaetz's office said he planned to close his Washington office as he awaited test results. ""Congressman Gaetz was informed today that he came into contact with a CPAC attendee 11 days ago who tested positive for COVID-19,"" read a tweet from the congressman's account, adding that ""while the Congressman is not experiencing symptoms, he received testing today and expects results soon."" ""Under doctor's usual precautionary recommendations, he'll remain self-quarantined until the 14-day period expires this week,"" Gaetz's account said. The attending physician for the U.S. Capitol acknowledged Monday that the patient had contact with “several” members of Congress at CPAC. In a statement Monday, Dr. Brian Monahan said that the individual who has been diagnosed with coronavirus was “able to recall specific names of people he had contact with during the meeting.” TRUMP DOWNPLAYS CORONAVIRUS THREAT, NOTES 'COMMON FLU' KILLS THOUSANDS EVERY YEAR Three senior members of Gosar’s staff are also self-quarantined, the lawmaker said. Last week, Gaetz got attention for wearing a gas mask on the House floor and in the Capitol building. The White House was made aware of the CPAC attendee’s diagnosis, as both Trump and Vice President Pence attended and spoke at the conference which took place from Feb. 26 to 29. The White House said there is no indication that Trump or Pence was in close proximity to the stricken attendee. Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, which puts on CPAC, said he had a brief and “incidental contact” with the patient. He is also self-quarantined at this time, despite feeling no symptoms. Despite not having contact with the individual, Trump did come into contact with Schlapp. Meanwhile, Trump downplayed the threat of coronavirus on Monday, noting that the “common flu” kills thousands of Americans each year and that “life & the economy go on.” “So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year,” Trump tweeted Monday. ""Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus with 22 deaths. Think about that!” According to the CDC, during the 2018-2019 flu season in the U.S., an estimated 35.5 million people were sick with influenza and approximately 34,200 people died from the illness.

Trump said that he plans to meet with Senate leadership on Wednesday to discuss a payroll tax cut, small business aid and help for hourly workers who might become sick. “They’ll be very dramatic,” Trump said of the proposed economic measures during an evening briefing at the White House. “This blindsided the world and I think we handled it very well.” Trump told reporters that the administration was seeking “very substantial relief."" Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow were expected to make the request of Senate Republicans on Tuesday afternoon. The markets appeared to react positively to Trump's announcement, with futures on all three major indices surging by more than two percent. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE The president, who was joined in the White House briefing room by Vice President Mike Pence and the rest of the coronavirus task force, praised his administration’s work in combatting the virus – including prohibiting entry into the U.S. from certain countries and coordinating with state governors – and reiterated that the spread of the virus was not caused by mismanagement within Washington. “This is not our country’s fault, this was something that was thrown at us,” Trump said. “The main thing is we’re taking care of the American public.” Before his press conference, Trump met Mnuchin, Kudlow and other aides about a range of economic actions he could take. He also invited Wall Street executives to the White House on Wednesday to discuss the economic fallout of the epidemic. Kudlow told reporters Friday that the administration is not looking at a “massive” federal relief plan. Rather, any federal aid package would be “timely and targeted and micro.” Lawmakers on Capitol Hill had barely started to contemplate the economic implications of the spread of the virus and what might be needed to stimulate the economy as people cancel vacations and business trips and stay away from stores. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, told reporters that “everything’s on the table."" But members of the Senate Republican leadership, including Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, played down the need for an economic stimulus package of any kind, be it tax cuts or aid for workers. “It’s premature to be talking about that,” Cornyn told reporters. “I usually love tax cuts but I think it’s a little premature.” CORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN Democrats have indicated they preferred other responses, like passing legislation requiring employers to give their workers paid sick leave — a longtime policy priority of Democrats — and additional help for those with lower incomes. Pence, who is heading the task force combatting the outbreak of coronavirus, noted once again that the chances of Americans contracting the virus remain low – and of becoming seriously ill even lower – but warned that the precautions outlined by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) should still be followed. While intent on projecting calm, Trump earlier in the day lashed out about the plunging stock market and convened a meeting of his top economic advisers to address what to do about it. Meanwhile, the number of Republican lawmakers who announced they were isolating themselves because of possible exposure to the virus grew to five. As Trump grappled with an epidemic whose consequences he has repeatedly played down, the White House asserted it was conducting “business as usual.” But the day's business was anything but normal. Lawmakers pressed for details on how the Capitol could be made secure, a Pentagon meeting was broken into sub-groups to minimize the number of people in the same room and the Army commander in Europe placed himself in a precautionary quarantine. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The president dove into handshakes with supporters Monday morning when arriving to headline a fundraiser in Longwood, Fla., that raised approximately $4 million for his reelection campaign and the Republican Party. He ignored shouted questions about the sinking stock market as he boarded Air Force One for the flight back to Washington. On that flight was Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who later went into a voluntary quarantine. He was one of several GOP lawmakers who were exposed to a person at last month's Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) who later tested positive for the virus. Trump did not respond to shouted questions by reporters if he had been tested for the coronavirus following his flight with Gaetz. Pence said he did not know if the president had been tested but told reporters he had not himself received a test for the virus. Late Monday evening, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham issued a statement saying that Trump had not received testing for coronavirus because ""he has neither had prolonged close contact with any known confirmed COVID-19 patients, nor does he have any symptoms"" ""President Trump remains in excellent health, and his physician will continue to closely monitor him,"" Grisham said. On Monday, Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., and Gaetz put themselves in voluntary quarantine because of their contacts with the infected person at CPAC. Both said they did not have any symptoms but would wait out the remainder of the 14 days since the contact at home. Gaetz last week wore a gas mask to the House vote on the emergency funding bill for the virus response and said he wanted to highlight how Congress could become a “petri dish” for the virus. Collins met Trump on Tuesday night at the White House and shook hands with him Friday when the president visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Atlanta headquarters. “The president of the United States, as we all know, is quite a hand-washer,"" press secretary Stephanie Grisham told Fox News earlier Monday. ""He uses hand sanitizer all the time. So he's not concerned about this at all.” The Associated Press contributed to this report.

The U.S.-Taliban deal signed on Feb. 29 was touted as Washington’s effort to end 18 years of war in Afghanistan.

"                          Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders joins moderators Martha MacCallum and Bret Baier for a Fox News town hall in Dearborn, Michigan. Underscoring what’s at stake for his White House bid when Michigan and five other states hold Democratic presidential nomination contests on Tuesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders emphasizes that “this is a very, very important day in Michigan.” Speaking in front of more than 10,000 people at a rally at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, the populist senator from Vermont on Sunday spotlighted that Michigan’s “the most important state” to hold a contest on March 10, which is being dubbed ‘mini Super Tuesday’ or ‘Super Tuesday 2.0.’       Democratic presidential candidate U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., speaks during a campaign rally at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Mich., Sunday, March 8, 2020. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya)       MARCH 10 PRIMARY PRIMER: THE STATES AND THE STAKES With 125 pledged delegates at stake, Michigan is the biggest prize among the six states holding contests on Tuesday. The others are Missouri, Mississippi, Washington state, Idaho and North Dakota. Sanders, a populist senator who’s making his second-straight presidential run, defeated eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016's primary in Michigan, in what was considered a major upset victory. That foreshadowed Clinton’s narrow loss to Donald Trump in the November 2016 general election in Michigan. Trump’s victory with working-class white voters in the state, as well as similar narrow wins in two other crucial Rust Belt states – Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – propelled him to the White House. The pre-Michigan primary polls in 2016 got it all wrong – as they indicated Clinton with a double-digit lead over Sanders. “The 2016 Michigan Democratic primary is considered to be the biggest polling miss of that cycle. Polls released in the week before the state primary showed Hillary Clinton with anywhere from a 10 to 27 point lead,"" noted Monmouth University pollster Patrick Murray. Fast forward four years and former Vice President Joe Biden’s now the clear front-runner in Michigan with the final polls released on primary eve indicating the former vice president with a double-digit lead over Sanders. But Sanders is holding out hope for a repeat performance that would stave off elimination and instead boost the senator back into a massive battle with Biden for the nomination. An optimistic Sanders predicted on Fox News Sunday “I think we're gonna do well on Tuesday, and we're gonna beat Biden.”  While a loss would be considered a setback, Sanders doesn’t see such a prospect as fatal. “I certainly would not consider dropping out,” he stressed. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 20S0 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN  Sanders was the front-runner for the Democratic nomination after winning the Feb. 11 New Hampshire primary and then shellacking the field a week and a half later at the Nevada caucuses. But thanks to his landslide victory in South Carolina a week and a half ago – and a strong performance during last week’s Super Tuesday when he swept 10 of the 14 states holding primaries on Super Tuesday and took the lead over Sanders in the all-important race for Democratic nomination convention delegates – Biden’s moved closer to locking up the nomination. Because of its general election political symbolism and the large delegate cache, Michigan’s capturing the lion’s share of media attention among this week’s round of contests. Biden - very cognizant of the polling debacle in 2016 – stressed on Monday that “I’m kind of superstitious, I see all these polls...I remember Hillary was up by 23 points...I don’t take anything for granted.” Biden, with an eye on November’s general election, emphasized during a rally Monday in Flint that “Michigan is an important contest not just for the Democratic primary, because the outcome of Michigan in November may determine who the next person United States is going to be.” The former vice president’s enjoyed a tidal wave of endorsements from current and former members of Congress and governors the past 10 days - as the party establishment and other moderates all coalesced around Biden to prevent Sanders – a self-described democratic socialist – from becoming the party’s standard-bearer in November’s general election. And many of his former rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination have endorsed his White House bid. Two of those one-time rivals – Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California – joined Biden on the campaign trail in Michigan on Monday after backing him just in the past 24 hours. Sanders, fighting for survival, has increased his jabs at Biden in the wake of Super Tuesday. At a Fox News town hall on primary eve in Detroit, Sanders charged that Biden had ""bailed out the crooks on Wall Street who nearly destroyed our economy 12 years ago."" But he failed to mention that $700 billion rescue plan also had the support of then-presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain. A day earlier in Ann Arbor, Sanders slammed the former vice president  - saying “here we are a few days before a major primary here in Michigan. And we are taking on, in this campaign, not just Joe Biden….We're taking on the 60 billionaires who are funding his campaign. Biden, in a much more comfortable position, has refrained from blasting Sanders. Instead, on Monday he gently jabbed his rival, saying “we’re not looking for a revolution.” The push for a political revolution has long been a staple of Sanders stump speech. But the former vice president’s aiming for what he hopes will a be a near knockout punch to Sanders. Democratic strategist Michael Ceraso – a veteran of the 2016 Sanders campaign and the 2020 White House bid by former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg – stressed that a Biden victory in Michigan coupled with likely wins in Missouri and Mississippi will “put a huge hurdle in front of Sanders to get the delegates he needs to win.”    ",         Sanders fights for another rust belt upset to regain momentum against Biden,         2020-03-09T231941-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/sanders-fights-for-another-rust-belt-upset-to-regain-momentum-against-biden,Fox

Aides on Capitol Hill are anxious over what they consider to be a muddled response from both their bosses and the White House to the coronavirus outbreak. Lawmakers in both chambers have been fielding questions from members and staff about how Capitol Hill will be secured, but congressional leaders have so far shown little willingness to close the Capitol building, despite meetings being scheduled throughout the day to discuss preparations. “The chiefs of staff are in a panic,” one longtime aide told Fox News when speaking about coronavirus.  CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE The hesitancy to close Congress could be due in part to fears of how it would affect the already shaky stock market, which plunged to its lowest point since the 2008 financial crisis on Monday.  If Congress were to close up in the midst of the virus outbreak, a number of issues would need to be dealt with, including finding thousands of laptops for aides and members to use when working from home. Fox News is told that congressional work must be performed on congressionally issued computers or devices. The question of how Congress will operate also comes as a number of lawmakers have self-quarantined themselves after being in contact with someone exposed to the virus.  On Sunday, two members of Congress, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., said they are isolating themselves after determining they had contact with the person at the Conservative Political Action Conference nearly two weeks ago. Cruz said Sunday he had brief contact with the man and would spend the next few days at his home in Texas until a full 14 days had passed since their interaction. Gosar said that he had also made contact with the man at CPAC and that he and three members of his senior staff were under self-quarantine. His office will be closed for the week, he said in a tweet Sunday. President Trump also attended the CPAC conference. Besides Cruz and Gosar, the CPAC schedule listed three other senators and 12 House members as speakers. They included House Minority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, House Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney of Wyoming and congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina, who has since become the White House chief of staff. Also on the schedule was Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. A spokesman for Cheney said she has been told by CPAC that she was not exposed to the convention attendee who has tested positive for the coronavirus.

"                          Jenny Beth Martin, chairman of the Tea Party Patriots, and Democratic strategist Mustafa Tameez joins the debate. EXCLUSIVE: The Trump campaign has sent a scathing letter to Twitter's leadership after the platform took the unprecedented step of labeling one of its videos ""manipulated media,"" saying that under the social media giant's new standard, Joe Biden's team has uploaded its own ""doctored and deceptively edited"" video as recently as last week. “The Biden campaign is scared as hell that voters will see the flood of unedited and embarrassing verbal stumbles that will continue go viral if ‘Status Quo Joe’ is the nominee,"" Trump campaign rapid response director Andrew Clark told Fox News. ""Twitter shouldn’t be an enforcement arm of Joe Biden’s campaign strategy, but if they choose to police every video clip they must hold his own campaign to the same standard.” The confrontation began this the weekend when Trump communications director Dan Scavino tweeted an edited version of a Biden speech in which the former vice president appears to deliver a muddled and inadvertent endorsement of Trump. Scavino's clip, which the president later reposted, did not alter any of Biden's words, but it cut off before the conclusion of Biden's sentence at a rally in St. Louis. Conservatives called the video an obvious attempt to highlight Biden's verbal gaffes, and argued that no one would reasonably mistake it for a genuine Biden endorsement. ""Understandably, the Biden campaign has a strategic interest in intimidating social media companies into suppressing true and embarrassing video evidence of Joe Biden’s continued inability to communicate coherently—a sad truth that has been publicly noted by Democrats and media figures alike,"" Trump campaign chief operating officer Michael Glassner wrote in the missive to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, general counsel Vijaya Gadde, and public policy director Carlos Monje. ""Still, it appears that many people employed by Big Tech corporations in Silicon Valley are assisting the Biden campaign by instituting a special ‘Biden protection rule’ that effectively censors and silences legitimate political speech Biden’s campaign and its supporters do not like,"" he added in the letter, obtained by Fox News. Glassner said he was ""formally requesting that Twitter apply its new 'manipulated media' label to a doctored and deceptively edited video tweeted by the Biden campaign less than a week ago."" That was a reference to a March 3 video uploaded by the Biden campaign that contains a slew of clips that are taken out of context, and ""manipulates audio and video of President Trump in order to mislead Americans and give a false impression,"" Glassner wrote. The video, Glassner points out, contains two clips ""spliced together to fabricate a quote and give viewers the false impression that he called the coronavirus a 'hoax,'"" a claim that the non-partisan International Fact-Checking Network has previously debunked. The president in fact called Democrats' response to the coronavirus ""their new hoax."" Additionally, the Biden video effectively repeats a false claim the former vice president himself made in his campaign launch video, asserting through selective editing that the president called white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va. ""very fine people."" That assertion, although widely made in progressive circles, is untrue; the president was referring to protesters on both sides of the issue of whether Confederate statues should be removed from public places as ""very fine people."" ""In fact, 49 seconds after President Trump said those words, he said, 'and I’m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally,'"" Glassner wrote. ""As one CNN anchor said, 'he’s not saying that the neo-Nazis and white supremacists are very fine people[.]'"". ""If Twitter is not seeking to protect Joe Biden, we urge it to correct its apparent oversight and apply its standards equally across the board."" Third, the Biden video contains a 2016 clip in which then-candidate Trump declares ""the American Dream is dead"" -- but leaves out the second part of Trump's sentence, in which he says, ""but if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.” READ THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN'S LETTER TO TWITTER CEO ""Of course, this is not the first time the Biden campaign has used editing tricks to manipulate video and feed misinformation to the American people,"" Glassner wrote. ""If Twitter is not seeking to protect Joe Biden, we urge it to correct its apparent oversight and apply its standards equally across the board."" Fox News has identified several other videos posted to Biden's Twitter account that contain similar misleading clips. An October 2019 post on Biden's campaign account, for example, states that Trump ""has asked foreign governments to interfere in our elections,"" and is accompanied by a video of a White House interview that omits Trump's full remarks. In the full interview, Trump says, ""I think maybe you do both,"" referring to notifying the FBI as well as listening to an offer of political help from a foreign entity; but in the Biden clip, Trump says only that he would ""listen"" to the proposal from a foreign entity. Glassner made clear that the Trump campaign was not backing off its original video of Biden, saying the clip was ""a 100 percent real, 100 percent authentic, 100 percent unedited video of Joe Biden saying, 'We cannot win this re-election. Excuse me. We can only re-elect Donald Trump[.]'"" TRUMP EMBRACES MUDDLED BIDEN 'ENDORSEMENT,' AS COMPETENCY CONCERNS MOUNT In order for American elections to remain ""free and fair,"" Glassner wrote, ""it is critical that the Biden campaign be held to the same standard it is demanding apply to others."" In the post uploaded by Scavino, Biden seemingly endorses the president after stammering over some words. ""Turn this primary from a campaign that's about negative attacks into one about what we're for, because we cannot get -- re-elect -- we cannot win this re-election -- excuse me. We can only re-elect Donald Trump,"" Biden says in the edited clip. In the full speech, Biden went on to add,"" -- if, in fact, we get engaged in this circular firing squad here. Gotta be a positive campaign, so join us."" Twitter quickly labeled the tweet ""misinformation,"" in the social media giant's first-ever use of its new policy, which is ostensibly designed to combat the spread of false news. The so-called Synthetic and Manipulated Media policy states that ""you may not deceptively share synthetic or manipulated media that are likely to cause harm."" The policy went into effect Mar. 5 after a campaign video from Mike Bloomberg's team added crickets and a long silence when Bloomberg asked his rivals if any of them had started a business. Facebook has said that the Trump video would not meet its platform for deceptive editing. Currently, no misinformation flag appears on the video for some users when it is directly clicked, although a warning does appear if the video shows up in a user's feed. Twitter has said it is working to apply the warning whenever the clip is accessed. BILLIONAIRE REPUBLICAN BUYS MAJOR STAKE IN TWITTER, COULD OUST CEO SOON The broader issue of Biden's potential competency issues looms large over the 2020 presidential race. Also in St. Louis, Biden bizarrely described himself as an ""O'Biden Bama"" Democrat, transposing his name and the name of his old boss. Trump suggested at a Fox News Town Hall last week that Biden isn't fit for office. ""I'm all set for Bernie, communist,"" Trump began. ""And then we have this crazy thing that happened on Tuesday, which he [Biden] thought was Thursday.

"                          Reaction from former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise. I found myself thinking over the weekend that with Joe Biden now favored to win the nomination, it won’t be long before the press starts the quadrennial veepstakes ritual. And yesterday—boom!—it arrived in spades. The coronavirus may be spreading worldwide, Wall Street may be having a bloodbath, and Biden has yet to beat Bernie Sanders in Michigan and other key states. But nothing stops the VP speculation. GENDER QUESTIONS SWIRL AS WARREN LEAVES RACE TO TWO OLD MEN There’s an added twist this year, which is the widespread expectation—and, in some quarters, demand—that the Democratic running mate will be a woman. As the New York Times put it, “prominent Democrats began publicly insisting that the ticket include a woman, preferably a black woman.” There is a pressure campaign, to be sure, but it also makes good political sense for a 77-year-old nominee to pick someone who can take over the presidency—and, in a year when four women were knocked out of the race, to choose someone of a different gender. “There must be a woman on this ticket,” Cecile Richards, the longtime abortion rights activist who helped found Supermajority, told the paper. I guess that’s what activists do. Given that there have been exactly two female VP nominees—Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 and Sarah Palin in 2008—a woman who actually won the vice presidency would be a definite milestone, even if Elizabeth Warren supporters are still fuming about alleged sexism. Needless to say, a woman at that level of the White House would also be a strong contender to succeed a septuagenarian president, who might serve only one term. (Sanders also says he’ll consider a woman if he wins the nomination fight.) The Times, turning it on the president, says “such a choice could generate enthusiasm from female voters who make up the backbone of the party and sharpen their contrast with Mr. Trump, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by nearly a dozen women.” Now comes the inevitable journalistic parlor game: Who? SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES Washington Post Editorial Page Editor Fred Hiatt says the search should start with Warren, Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand, “who gained stature and name recognition” during the campaign. The problem: “They all lost, and they all had time to rub at least some voters the wrong way.” I’m not sure Warren is a great pick because she’s 70 (not much of a youth movement there) and so much more progressive (she backs Medicare-for-All, which Biden has denounced). Harris might seem like a long shot after she eviscerated Biden on the debate stage over busing in the 1970s. But the former VP is said to like her because she was friendly with his late son Beau. Hiatt then floats such governors as Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island and Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico, as well as Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer, his new national co-chair. He throws in some mayors as well. My take: If Biden selects someone who most of America has never heard of, he starts out behind. The media vetting of whether that person is qualified to assume the presidency would start from scratch, and all kinds of things pop up. That hurt John McCain when he picked the relatively inexperienced Sarah Palin in 2008, and makes the choice a wild card. The Week does some handicapping: Warren “would help excite women — above all highly educated professional women,” but that she “dramatically underperformed” in the campaign. Klobuchar would “bolster Biden’s moderate bona fides,” but “failed to generate much enthusiasm among voters.” Harris “exudes energy and compassion” and having a woman of color would be a plus. As for Stacey Abrams, she’s not ready for prime time “as an author, voting-rights activist, former Georgia state representative, failed candidate for governor, and a celebrity of sorts among woke progressives and academics.” In the end, running mates don’t matter all that much. Donald Trump didn’t win because of Mike Pence, Hillary Clinton didn’t lose because of Tim Kaine, and Barack Obama didn’t win because of Biden. But given Biden’s age and the Democratic hunger for a woman on the ticket, whoever gets the nod might matter more this year than in the recent past. Footnote: Axios goes further with Biden’s “secret governing plan”: basically an assortment of names being floated for top jobs. They include John Kerry, Susan Rice, Mike Bloomberg, Jamie Dimon, Warren and Pete Buttigieg. But one you can basically count on: If Biden wins, adviser Ron Klain, his chief of staff as VP—and the Obama czar for the Ebola outbreak—will be White House chief of staff.

"                          Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders joins moderators Martha MacCallum and Bret Baier for a Fox News town hall in Dearborn, Michigan. Underscoring what’s at stake for his White House bid when Michigan and five other states hold Democratic presidential nomination contests on Tuesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders emphasizes that “this is a very, very important day in Michigan.” Speaking in front of more than 10,000 people at a rally at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, the populist senator from Vermont on Sunday spotlighted that Michigan’s “the most important state” to hold a contest on March 10, which is being dubbed ‘mini Super Tuesday’ or ‘Super Tuesday 2.0.’       Democratic presidential candidate U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., speaks during a campaign rally at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Mich., Sunday, March 8, 2020. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya)       MARCH 10 PRIMARY PRIMER: THE STATES AND THE STAKES With 125 pledged delegates at stake, Michigan is the biggest prize among the six states holding contests on Tuesday. The others are Missouri, Mississippi, Washington state, Idaho and North Dakota. Sanders, a populist senator who’s making his second-straight presidential run, defeated eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016's primary in Michigan, in what was considered a major upset victory. That foreshadowed Clinton’s narrow loss to Donald Trump in the November 2016 general election in Michigan. Trump’s victory with working-class white voters in the state, as well as similar narrow wins in two other crucial Rust Belt states – Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – propelled him to the White House. The pre-Michigan primary polls in 2016 got it all wrong – as they indicated Clinton with a double-digit lead over Sanders. “The 2016 Michigan Democratic primary is considered to be the biggest polling miss of that cycle. Polls released in the week before the state primary showed Hillary Clinton with anywhere from a 10 to 27 point lead,"" noted Monmouth University pollster Patrick Murray. Fast forward four years and former Vice President Joe Biden’s now the clear front-runner in Michigan with the final polls released on primary eve indicating the former vice president with a double-digit lead over Sanders. But Sanders is holding out hope for a repeat performance that would stave off elimination and instead boost the senator back into a massive battle with Biden for the nomination. An optimistic Sanders predicted on Fox News Sunday “I think we're gonna do well on Tuesday, and we're gonna beat Biden.”  While a loss would be considered a setback, Sanders doesn’t see such a prospect as fatal. “I certainly would not consider dropping out,” he stressed. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 20S0 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN  Sanders was the front-runner for the Democratic nomination after winning the Feb. 11 New Hampshire primary and then shellacking the field a week and a half later at the Nevada caucuses. But thanks to his landslide victory in South Carolina a week and a half ago – and a strong performance during last week’s Super Tuesday when he swept 10 of the 14 states holding primaries on Super Tuesday and took the lead over Sanders in the all-important race for Democratic nomination convention delegates – Biden’s moved closer to locking up the nomination. Because of its general election political symbolism and the large delegate cache, Michigan’s capturing the lion’s share of media attention among this week’s round of contests. Biden - very cognizant of the polling debacle in 2016 – stressed on Monday that “I’m kind of superstitious, I see all these polls...I remember Hillary was up by 23 points...I don’t take anything for granted.” Biden, with an eye on November’s general election, emphasized during a rally Monday in Flint that “Michigan is an important contest not just for the Democratic primary, because the outcome of Michigan in November may determine who the next person United States is going to be.” The former vice president’s enjoyed a tidal wave of endorsements from current and former members of Congress and governors the past 10 days - as the party establishment and other moderates all coalesced around Biden to prevent Sanders – a self-described democratic socialist – from becoming the party’s standard-bearer in November’s general election. And many of his former rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination have endorsed his White House bid. Two of those one-time rivals – Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California – joined Biden on the campaign trail in Michigan on Monday after backing him just in the past 24 hours. Sanders, fighting for survival, has increased his jabs at Biden in the wake of Super Tuesday. At a Fox News town hall on primary eve in Detroit, Sanders charged that Biden had ""bailed out the crooks on Wall Street who nearly destroyed our economy 12 years ago."" But he failed to mention that $700 billion rescue plan also had the support of then-presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain. A day earlier in Ann Arbor, Sanders slammed the former vice president  - saying “here we are a few days before a major primary here in Michigan. And we are taking on, in this campaign, not just Joe Biden….We're taking on the 60 billionaires who are funding his campaign. Biden, in a much more comfortable position, has refrained from blasting Sanders. Instead, on Monday he gently jabbed his rival, saying “we’re not looking for a revolution.” The push for a political revolution has long been a staple of Sanders stump speech. But the former vice president’s aiming for what he hopes will a be a near knockout punch to Sanders. Democratic strategist Michael Ceraso – a veteran of the 2016 Sanders campaign and the 2020 White House bid by former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg – stressed that a Biden victory in Michigan coupled with likely wins in Missouri and Mississippi will “put a huge hurdle in front of Sanders to get the delegates he needs to win.”    ",         Sanders fights for another Rust Belt upset to regain momentum against Biden,         2020-03-09T231941-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/sanders-fights-for-another-rust-belt-upset-to-regain-momentum-against-biden,Fox
"                          Illinois Governor Rauner on why the Supreme Court's ruling is a big victory. The plaintiff whose 2018 case led to a Supreme Court ruling that mandatory public union agency fees for nonmembers were unconstitutional is now asking the high court to force the union that represented him to return a portion of the money it collected before that decision. In this most recent case, Janus v. AFSCME III, plaintiff Mark Janus is asking for the union to pay back fees it took from his paycheck before the landmark ruling in his 2018 case. He claims that the Supreme Court's ruling should be retroactive, echoing other claims that have been made in federal court, including a sweeping class action that was filed in California last year. SUPREME COURT AT APPARENT ODDS OVER KEY ABORTION CASE ON CLINIC ACCESS RESTRICTIONS ""The Supreme Court agreed that the union taking money from nonmembers was wrong but the union still has the money it illegally garnished from my paycheck,"" Janus said in a press release through the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, one of the organizations handling his case.       Tommy Few, alongside California Policy Center attorney Mark Bucher, Liberty Justice Institute attorney Brian Kelsey, and Mark Janus (L-R).      (Courtesy of Will Swaim/CPC) Janus is seeking the return of about $3,000 in fees taken from his paycheck between 2013 and 2018. ""Mark Janus is just one of many public employees whose money was illegally taken by government unions,” said Patrick Hughes, Liberty Justice Center president and co-founder. Liberty Justice Center is the other group working on Janus' case. “Workers across the country are rightfully asking for their money back,"" Hughes continued. ""It is time for the U.S. Supreme Court to weigh in on this issue and finally hold unions accountable for their years of unconstitutional behavior."" The district court and the Seventh Circuit each ruled that AFSCME, while acting legally under Illinois state law to collect agency fees, was acting in good faith and does not need to pay Janus back any money that was collected before his 2018 Supreme Court victory. ""Until [the Janus decision] said otherwise, AFSCME had a legal right to receive and spend fair-share fees collected from nonmembers as long as it complied with state law ... It did not demonstrate bad faith when it followed these rules,"" the Seventh Circuit said in its opinion. Janus disputes this argument, saying that whether or not the union thought it was complying with the law does not matter. CONSERVATIVE LEADERS SIGN LETTER CALLING FOR SCHUMER CENSURE OVER ALLEGED THREATS TO KAVANAUGH, GORSUCH ""Under Janus, a union deprives public employees of their First Amendment Rights by taking their money without affirmative consent,"" Janus' brief asking the Supreme Court to hear his case says. ""A union's intent when doing so is immaterial."" The 2018 Janus ruling barred mandatory agency fees on First Amendment grounds, arguing that the money given to the union went to causes and speech that Janus -- and presumably at least some other public employees -- disagreed with. Unions are often significant boosters for Democrats and liberal causes. At the time, liberals and unions were concerned that banning mandatory agency fees would lead to significant financial hardships for public sector unions and eventually a ""death spiral."" ""Because unions will retain their role as exclusive bargaining representatives, they will still have to gather information on public safety employees' needs, engage in collective bargaining, and enforce collective bargaining agreements, even when particular violations only involve nonmembers,"" a brief submitted for the 2018 Janus case by a group of public safety employee unions said. ""Consequently, many unions risk a 'death spiral': unions will have to raise dues to make up the budget shortfall attributable to the elimination of fair-share fees, causing membership numbers to fall, which will necessitate raising dues further, and so on."" To be sure, unions have done well since the 2018 Supreme Court ruling. AFSCME has even boasted about its financial health. WHO ARE THE 9 JUSTICES OF THE SUPREME COURT? But a ruling against the unions again could open the floodgates to more lawsuits from workers who also want a refund of their agency fees that were collected before 2018. While Janus is only seeking about $3,000 in his claim, the groups backing Janus' suit said in a press release that they are working on over 30 cases similar to this one, totaling a whopping $120 million in requested refunds. These are not the only type of post-Janus challenges to union power before the Supreme Court, however. The high court is expected to decide this term whether it will hear the case of a University of Maine professor who is arguing that not only should public-sector unions be barred from taking mandatory agency fees, but they should not be allowed exclusive representation of all employees in a workplace. ""The union still has the ability to be my exclusive representative,” Jonathan Reisman, the plaintiff in the case, said in a video produced by the organization representing him. “And I’m still associated with the positions that they take. That really is the problem."" Seventh Circuit Judge Daniel Manion, in a concurring opinion on the latest Janus challenge, agreed that the ""good faith"" defense protected AFSCME from further financial liability in Janus' suit. But he said the union should consider itself fortunate to have unconstitutionally collected agency fees for 41 years under law the Supreme Court later said was wrong. That is a sentiment some conservative justices may latch onto in a potential ruling against AFSCME if the Supreme Court agrees to hear the case. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""Even though the Supreme Court reached the wrong result [in a case decades before its landmark 2018 ruling], the unions justify their acceptance of many millions of dollars because they accepted the money in 'good faith,'"" Manion wrote. ""Probably a better way of looking at it would be to say rather than good faith, they had very 'good luck' in receiving this windfall for so many years. Since the court is not holding that the unions must repay a portion of the windfall, they can remind themselves of their good luck for the years ahead.""

"                          Jenny Beth Martin, chairman of the Tea Party Patriots, and Democratic strategist Mustafa Tameez joins the debate. EXCLUSIVE: The Trump campaign has sent a scathing letter to Twitter's leadership after the platform took the unprecedented step of labeling one of its videos ""manipulated media,"" saying that under the social media giant's new standard, Joe Biden's team has uploaded its own ""doctored and deceptively edited"" video as recently as last week. “The Biden campaign is scared as hell that voters will see the flood of unedited and embarrassing verbal stumbles that will continue go viral if ‘Status Quo Joe’ is the nominee,"" Trump campaign rapid response director Andrew Clark told Fox News. ""Twitter shouldn’t be an enforcement arm of Joe Biden’s campaign strategy, but if they choose to police every video clip they must hold his own campaign to the same standard.” The confrontation began this weekend when Trump communications director Dan Scavino tweeted an edited version of a Biden speech in which the former vice president appears to deliver a muddled and inadvertent endorsement of Trump. Scavino's clip, which the president later reposted, did not alter any of Biden's words, but it cut off before the conclusion of Biden's sentence at a rally in St. Louis. Conservatives called the video an obvious attempt to highlight Biden's verbal gaffes, and argued that no one would reasonably mistake it for a genuine Biden endorsement. ""Understandably, the Biden campaign has a strategic interest in intimidating social media companies into suppressing true and embarrassing video evidence of Joe Biden’s continued inability to communicate coherently—a sad truth that has been publicly noted by Democrats and media figures alike,"" Trump campaign chief operating officer Michael Glassner wrote in the missive to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, general counsel Vijaya Gadde, and public policy director Carlos Monje. ""Still, it appears that many people employed by Big Tech corporations in Silicon Valley are assisting the Biden campaign by instituting a special ‘Biden protection rule’ that effectively censors and silences legitimate political speech Biden’s campaign and its supporters do not like,"" he added in the letter, obtained by Fox News. Glassner said he was ""formally requesting that Twitter apply its new 'manipulated media' label to a doctored and deceptively edited video tweeted by the Biden campaign less than a week ago."" That was a reference to a March 3 video uploaded by the Biden campaign that contains a slew of clips that are taken out of context, and ""manipulates audio and video of President Trump in order to mislead Americans and give a false impression,"" Glassner wrote. The video, Glassner points out, contains two clips ""spliced together to fabricate a quote and give viewers the false impression that he called the coronavirus a 'hoax,'"" a claim that the non-partisan International Fact-Checking Network has previously debunked. The president in fact called Democrats' response to the coronavirus ""their new hoax."" Additionally, the Biden video effectively repeats a false claim the former vice president himself made in his campaign launch video, asserting through selective editing that the president called white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va. ""very fine people."" That assertion, although widely made in progressive circles, is untrue; the president was referring to protesters on both sides of the issue of whether Confederate statues should be removed from public places as ""very fine people."" ""In fact, 49 seconds after President Trump said those words, he said, 'and I’m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally,'"" Glassner wrote. ""As one CNN anchor said, 'he’s not saying that the neo-Nazis and white supremacists are very fine people[.]'"". ""If Twitter is not seeking to protect Joe Biden, we urge it to correct its apparent oversight and apply its standards equally across the board."" Third, the Biden video contains a 2016 clip in which then-candidate Trump declares ""the American Dream is dead"" -- but leaves out the second part of Trump's sentence, in which he says, ""but if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.” READ THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN'S LETTER TO TWITTER CEO ""Of course, this is not the first time the Biden campaign has used editing tricks to manipulate video and feed misinformation to the American people,"" Glassner wrote. ""If Twitter is not seeking to protect Joe Biden, we urge it to correct its apparent oversight and apply its standards equally across the board."" Fox News has identified several other videos posted to Biden's Twitter account that contain similar misleading clips. An October 2019 post on Biden's campaign account, for example, states that Trump ""has asked foreign governments to interfere in our elections,"" and is accompanied by a video of a White House interview that omits Trump's full remarks. In the full interview, Trump says, ""I think maybe you do both,"" referring to notifying the FBI as well as listening to an offer of political help from a foreign entity; but in the Biden clip, Trump says only that he would ""listen"" to the proposal from a foreign entity. Glassner made clear that the Trump campaign was not backing off its original video of Biden, saying the clip was ""a 100 percent real, 100 percent authentic, 100 percent unedited video of Joe Biden saying, 'We cannot win this re-election. Excuse me. We can only re-elect Donald Trump[.]'"" TRUMP EMBRACES MUDDLED BIDEN 'ENDORSEMENT,' AS COMPETENCY CONCERNS MOUNT In order for American elections to remain ""free and fair,"" Glassner wrote, ""it is critical that the Biden campaign be held to the same standard it is demanding apply to others."" In the post uploaded by Scavino, Biden seemingly endorses the president after stammering over some words. ""Turn this primary from a campaign that's about negative attacks into one about what we're for, because we cannot get -- re-elect -- we cannot win this re-election -- excuse me. We can only re-elect Donald Trump,"" Biden says in the edited clip. In the full speech, Biden went on to add,"" -- if, in fact, we get engaged in this circular firing squad here. Gotta be a positive campaign, so join us."" Twitter quickly labeled the tweet ""misinformation,"" in the social media giant's first-ever use of its new policy, which is ostensibly designed to combat the spread of false news. The so-called Synthetic and Manipulated Media policy states that ""you may not deceptively share synthetic or manipulated media that are likely to cause harm."" The policy went into effect Mar. 5 after a campaign video from Mike Bloomberg's team added crickets and a long silence when Bloomberg asked his rivals if any of them had started a business. Facebook has said that the Trump video would not meet its criteria for deceptive editing. Currently, no misinformation flag appears on the video for some users when it is directly clicked, although a warning does appear if the video shows up in a user's feed. Twitter has said it is working to apply the warning whenever the clip is accessed. ""We've received the letter and intend to respond,"" a Twitter spokesperson told Fox News. The Biden video that the Trump campaign flagged was posted two days after Twitter's manipulated-media policy went into effect, and Twitter has previously said it won't apply its new rules retroactively. BILLIONAIRE REPUBLICAN BUYS MAJOR STAKE IN TWITTER, COULD OUST CEO SOON The broader issue of Biden's potential competency issues looms large over the 2020 presidential race. Also in St. Louis, Biden bizarrely described himself as an ""O'Biden Bama"" Democrat, transposing his name and the name of his old boss. Trump suggested at a Fox News Town Hall last week that Biden isn't fit for office. ""I'm all set for Bernie, communist,"" Trump began. ""And then we have this crazy thing that happened on Tuesday, which he [Biden] thought was Thursday. But he also said 150 million people were killed with guns, and that he was running for the U.S. Senate -- there's something going on there.""

"                          Female reporters, pundits decry her withdrawal. In the days since Super Tuesday, the Democratic primary fight has winnowed to two: former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. That's a far cry from the roughly 25 Democratic candidates who initially threw their hats into the race. So what does one do after running for president? The crop of 2020 Democratic candidates is a large pool to sample. Some have returned to their full-time jobs on Capitol Hill, others have started nonprofits to channel their ideas, and a few have been stumping for one of the finalists. Read on for a look at what these also-rans are doing now. Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, who suspended his campaign on Feb. 11, returned to the Centennial State and has hosted several town halls in the last month. Minutes after New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker’s mid-January drop, he filed his reelection papers with the Federal Election Commission to start raising money for his November race in New Jersey. Booker is the latest former candidate to become a Biden endorser, announcing his support Monday morning. Booker was preceded in his support for Biden by California Sen. Kamala Harris, who joined Team Joe on Sunday. Both Booker and Harris campaigned in Michigan for Biden Monday night. Harris originally left the crowded Democratic field to fulfill her duties on Capitol Hill during the impeachment trial. Since the trial's end she’s been lending her name to help elect Todd Gloria as San Diego Mayor and has returned to her seat on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, where she recently made news in her questioning of acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand has been outspoken on Capitol Hill and on social media since suspending her presidential campaign in August. Gillibrand has posted supportive messages for her fellow Democratic candidates and vowed in the coming months to work on flipping the Senate and electing whoever wins the Democratic primary. She is one of the few former candidates who has yet to make an endorsement. Instead, she has been working on legislation that “checks” the Trump administration as well as less divisive measures like a bill to combat the rise of prescription drug costs and her new Data Protection Act, which would create what she calls a consumer watchdog agency to hold companies in the digital marketplace accountable for violating data protection and privacy laws. Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee has shifted his 2020 focus to a third gubernatorial term. He announced his reelection bid in August, a day after ending his presidential campaign. If successful, he'll join Republican Dan Evans as one of two three-term governors in Washington history. Washington state has been the focal point of coronavirus cases in the U.S., and Inslee has declared a state of emergency as the government marshals resources to combat the virus. Sen. Elizabeth Warren made an appearance on ""Saturday Night Live"" over the weekend after suspending her campaign late last week. She has yet to make an endorsement but is facing pressure to turn her supporters toward Sanders. The other Coloradan in the race, former Gov. John Hickenlooper, dropped out in August. While he initially said he had no interest in the Senate, he ultimately changed his mind. The former two-term governor heads a field of Democrats hoping to face Republican Cory Gardner in November. On Monday morning, right against the deadline, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock filed for a Senate run. This announcement came three months after the suspension of his presidential bid and after many months on the trail declaring he would not challenge incumbent Republican Gov. Steve Daines. Last month, he met with former President Obama in Washington and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in Montana. Former Rep. John Delaney has been weighing a run for governor of Maryland in 2022, a person familiar with the matter said. A campaign spokeswoman declined to comment. U.S. Representative for Massachusetts Seth Moulton has been acting as a surrogate for the Joe Biden campaign since January, while Julian Castro, the former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Obama, joined Warren’s campaign efforts until her suspension last Friday. On Feb. 23, after his victory in the Nevada caucuses, Marianne Williamson, an author and inspirational speaker, endorsed Sanders. Just last Thursday she joined Martha McCallum on Fox News' “The Story” to defend Sanders from Democratic strategist James Carville’s notion that Democrats need to unite around a Biden presidency, calling it “outrageous”. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar never truly left the campaign trail, though she did return to Washington D.C. for a quick vote on the coronavirus spending package. She made the announcement of her campaign suspension in the same speech that she started her duties as a Biden surrogate after rerouting a charter flight from her scheduled event in Oklahoma to Biden’s in Texas. She has made several stops in support of the former vice president since, primarily in the key delegate-rich state of Michigan. Beto O'Rourke, the former congressman from Texas, poured his resources into his political action committee, Powered by People, and – after a brief period of reflection in which he grew a beard – has been working to help Democrats win the Texas House this November. Last week he endorsed Joe Biden on the same day as Senator Klobuchar and former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg. He then took Biden for a livestreamed meal at Whataburger. After a disappointing finish in the New Hampshire primary, entrepreneur Andrew Yang was almost immediately scooped up by CNN to be a commentator, debuting his insight during their post-Nevada debate coverage hardly a week later. He also relentlessly teased his online following about a new project, a nonprofit inspired by his campaign messaging, ""Humanity Forward,"" which he announced last week. Humanity Forward has already raised over $3 million that will be dispersed as a part of his Universal Basic Income experiment. Entrepreneur and billionaire Tom Steyer has returned to the head of his voter registration non-profit Next Gen America after leaving the race Feb. 29 after a disappointing finish in South Carolina. He opined over the weekend in The New York Times that ""this campaign has reinforced my passion for spending all my time and money to change the political neglect that has brought this nation to a very low place."" Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg has been downplaying his endorsement of Biden since he delivered it after he suspended his campaign following Super Tuesday. On Monday morning, Bloomberg announced that he donated $2 million to Collective Future to fund the registration of 500,000 black voters before the November election.

"                          Sanders predicts a win in the state; Michigan Republican Rep. Bill Huizenga weighs in. A Bernie Sanders campaign rally this weekend featured an imam who previously said ISIS is ""connected to Israel"" as part of a conspiracy to kill people in order to make Islam look bad as a religion. Imam Sayed Hassan al-Qazwini spoke at Sanders' rally in Dearborn, Mich., according to The Detroit News, lauding Sanders for the fact that he ""united Americans."" But the imam, like many of Sanders' surrogates and associates, has a history of incendiary comments. SANDERS HIRES ADVISOR WHO BLAMED AMERICA FOR 9/11, QUESTIONED BIN LADEN OP, MOCKED MICHELLE OBAMA'S LOOKS ""ISIS somehow is connected to Israel,"" the imam said, according to an archived video posted to Twitter by the Middle East Media Research Institute. ""And ISIS is playing the role of the arm of the Zionists in the Muslim world to kill more Muslims and non-Muslims so it can define the name of Islam, so people can blame Islam for its atrocities, so people will be alienated from this religion."" The imam went on in the comments to claim that Muslims in the United States and Europe were being put in danger by the actions of ISIS and that ""the number one beneficiary of all these atrocities, I tell you, is the Zionists, and it is the Zionist regime."" Al-Qazwini is not the first Sanders surrogate to make such explosive comments. The Sanders campaign over the weekend added artist and organizer Phillip Agnew to its official staff. Agnew had previously insulted Michelle Obama's appearance multiple times, made controversial remarks about the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the U.S., and cast doubt on whether the Obama administration actually killed Usama bin Laden.

"                          Sanders invites Buttigieg supporters to join his campaign; Peter Doocy has the details. The race for the Democratic presidential nomination is a battle for delegates. As five major Democratic candidates have suspended their campaigns over the past week and a half, the lightning-fast winnowing of the field prompts the question: what happens to the delegates they have won? THE LATEST REPORTING FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN Read on for an explanation. How many delegates are needed to win? In this year’s Democratic nomination campaign, 1,991 pledged delegates are needed for a candidate to formally clinch the nomination at July’s Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. Where does the delegate race stand? Heading into the March 10 primaries and caucuses, former Vice President Joe Biden has 670 delegates, giving him a 96-delegate lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has 574. The only other remaining candidate in the race, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, has two delegates. How many delegates do these former candidates have?       Former 2020 Democratic candidates Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, former New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg, former South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.       Before dropping out, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts earned 69 delegates, former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg won 61, former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg won 26, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota won seven. So what happens to these delegates? It's complicated. The short answer is that some of those delegates will eventually be redistributed to other candidates still in the race while others will become ""free agents"" at this summer’s convention. According to the rules adopted by the Democratic National Committee, what happens to those delegates depends on how they were won. There are two ways for a candidate to win delegates: by hitting the 15 percent statewide threshold or by reaching 15 percent in a congressional district. Tell me about statewide pledged delegates. Statewide pledged delegates will be reallocated to candidates still in the race when the state parties hold conventions, which typically take place after a primary and before the national convention. In this case, that means either Biden or Sanders – or theoretically Gabbard as of now – will pick up delegates. Political scientist Josh Putnam – the author of the political website Frontloading HQ – took to Twitter a few days ago to game out what would happen to the 49 statewide delegates won by former candidates. The quick answer is that they would be nearly equally divided by Biden and Sanders. And what about those won at the congressional district level? As for the roughly 114 pledged delegates won at the congressional district level, they are not reallocated in the spring and would head to the July convention as ""free agents,"" according to DNC rules. Some of those delegates may feel an obligation to back whomever their candidate endorsed after dropping out. Bloomberg, Buttigieg and Klobuchar all backed Biden, with Warren staying neutral as of now. Could these delegates play a crucial role in picking the nominee? If the battle to reach 1,991 delegates stays tight between Biden and Sanders, the delegates pledged to the White House hopefuls who dropped out of the race could be a factor in determining which candidate wins the nomination. Technically, all pledged delegates are free to eventually support whomever they want because they are bound to a candidate through a pledge – and nothing more. They could in theory defect and back a different candidate, but that rarely happens.

"                          Dozens of conservative leaders have signed a letter calling for the censure of Democrat Sen. Chuck Schumer over his comments on Supreme Court Justices Kavanaugh and Gorsuch. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is the subject of several ethics complaints following his controversial remarks directed toward Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. In the days following Schumer’s statements at an abortion rights rally outside the court building – comments some described as a threat – complaints were sent to the Senate Ethics Committee and the New York bar’s Grievance Committee, alleging that the Democratic leader’s remarks violated ethics rules. CONSERVATIVE LEADERS SIGN LETTER CALLING FOR SCHUMER CENSURE OVER ALLEGED THREATS TO KAVANAUGH, GORSUCH “At a minimum, Attorney/Senator Schumer’s statements appear to be improper conduct that reflects upon his character and fitness to practice law in New York,” attorney Joseph Gioconda wrote in a letter sent Monday to New York’s Grievance Committee for the Second Judicial District, where Schumer is admitted. Speaking at an event hosted by the Center for Reproductive Rights as the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case focusing on a Louisiana abortion law, Schumer had issued a warning to the two justices appointed by President Trump. ""I want to tell you, Gorsuch. I want to tell you, Kavanaugh. You have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price!"" Schumer said. ""You won’t know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions."" Chief Justice John Roberts was quick to respond, calling Schumer’s words “inappropriate” and “dangerous,” as Schumer reacted by accusing Roberts of being biased in his response. The National Legal Policy Center, a right-leaning nonprofit organization, filed complaints with the New York bar and the Senate Ethics Committee Friday, seeking discipline both for Schumer’s statements at the rally and for calling into question Roberts’ motives for his response. MCCONNELL SLAMS SCHUMER ON SENATE FLOOR FOR CONTROVERSIAL REMARKS DIRECTED AT SUPREME COURT JUSTICES Their complaint claims that Schumer violated Senate ethics rules by engaging in “improper conduct which may reflect upon the Senate.” The NLPC also alleged that Schumer violated New York’s Rules of Professional Conduct through “conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.” The NLPC referenced condemnation from conservatives and liberals alike, citing a critical tweet from Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe that called Schumer’s language “inexcusable,” as well as condemnation on the Senate floor by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who said, “There is nothing to call this except a threat.” Schumer responded to McConnell by admitting that he ""should not have used the words I used,"" and that ""they didn't come out the way I intended to."" Schumer did not apologize but excused himself by saying, “I'm from Brooklyn. We speak in strong language.” The NLPC’s complaint asserts that Schumer’s statement was unsatisfactory. “It strains credulity to believe that, regardless of his Brooklyn pedigree, Sen. Schumer, who is a Harvard-educated lawyer, Senator minority leader, and vocal opponent of both Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, did not intend to choose the exact words he spoke as he turned and pointed to the Supreme Court behind him to further emphasize his point,” the complaint said. “In short, his non-apology is a lame excuse for inexcusable conduct.” The Landmark Legal Foundation, chaired by ""Life, Liberty, & Levin"" host Mark Levin, filed a complaint of their own with the Senate Ethics Committee on Thursday. “The Senate must immediately reprimand, if not censure, Sen. Schumer for his outrageous and dangerous attack on Supreme Court Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh,” said the complaint, which also claimed that Schumer’s statements may have constituted “improper conduct which may reflect upon the Senate.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Both Landmark’s and NLPC’s complaints also alleged possible violations of federal law for threatening an officer of the court. These complaints follow the introduction of a resolution from Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., calling for Schumer to be censured, and a letter to the Senate signed by dozens of well-known conservative leaders calling for censure.

"                          Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders joins moderators Martha MacCallum and Bret Baier for a Fox News town hall in Dearborn, Michigan. As his struggling campaign seeks a big win in Michigan's Tuesday primary, Bernie Sanders took the stage at a Fox News Town Hall in Detroit and wasted little time in dismissing front-runner Joe Biden as a friend to ""crooks"" – and former rival Hillary Clinton as a seemingly bitter ex-candidate stuck in the past. ""I always give this guy a hard time,"" Sanders joked at the outset, referring to Fox News Channel anchor Bret Baier, who was hosting the town hall alongside Martha MacCallum. ""This is going to be fun tonight,"" Baier responded. Within minutes, Sanders took aim at the former vice president, saying Biden had ""bailed out the crooks on Wall Street who nearly destroyed our economy 12 years ago."" That $700 billion rescue plan also had the support of then-presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain. Questioned about Biden's recent verbal gaffes and his broader competence, Sanders remarked, ""I'm not here to criticize Joe, but to say that I think the American people at this incredibly complicated and difficult moment in our history, are entitled to thoughtful answers to the crises we face.""       Fox News Channel anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum question Sanders at the Fox News Town Hall on Monday in Detroit, Mich.       ""I'm not gonna go to that level – that's for people to decide,"" Sanders added, when Baier presented video of Democrats criticizing the former vice president's mental fitness for elected office. ""I’m not going to be making personal attacks on Joe."" The Biden campaign has repeatedly refused Fox News Channel's invitations to participate in a town hall. Separately, prompted by a recent video clip of Clinton claiming that ""nobody likes"" Sanders and that he ""didn't work until he was 41,"" Sanders responded: ""Unlike Secretary Clinton, I don't want to relive 2016. We're in 2020 now."" ""But, what I would say on a good day, is my wife likes me,"" Sanders said to applause. ""But also, if you guys look at some of the polling they do for United States senators, in most cases I turn out to be the most popular senator in the country."" (At the end of the town hall, in response to a question as to who his closest friend is in Washington, Sanders said, ""My wife."") Later, seeking to assure a voter from Russia that his brand of ""democratic socialism"" would not bring widespread poverty and despair to the United States, Sanders said he instead wanted a country more like Denmark, Finland and Sweden. ""What happened in the Soviet Union was not socialism, it was authoritarian communism,"" Sanders said as attendees cheered. ""I'm not an expert on the current economy in Sweden,"" Sanders responded when MacCallum noted Sweden was pushing toward more deregulation and fewer taxes, and that the population in the U.S. is much larger than that of the Nordic countries. ""They have gone a long way to eliminate poverty, to make sure that all of their people have the basic needs that they need to live good lives."" Sanders said studies have shown that countries like Denmark are among the ""happiest on earth,"" because they provide various free services like college and health care. Other studies, however, have shown that Denmark essentially free-rides heavily from U.S. capitalism, and argue that mimicking their welfare programs may backfire. Sanders also slammed President Trump's response to the coronavirus outbreak – and said that he would not consider closing the border, no matter what. ""If you had to, would you close down the borders?"" Baier asked, referring to efforts to stop the spread of coronavirus. ""No,"" Sanders replied flatly. He went on to condemn xenophobia and suggest that scientists would need to outline the appropriate approach. Sanders also hit Trump's appointment of Vice President Mike Pence to lead the coronavirus task force and inaccurately claimed that Trump had advised Americans with the virus to head to work. In fact, Trump told Fox News ""Hannity"" that, empirically, some Americans are going to work with the virus and recovering without incident. ""Sadly, we have an administration in Washington that has shown the world that it does not believe in science,"" Sanders said, taking aim at the White House on issues from climate change to health care. ""When you appoint Vice President Pence, an individual who also doesn't much believe in science, what you're telling the whole world is that you're politicizing this issue."" ""I'm not an expert on the current economy in Sweden."" Baier pressed Sanders on the coronavirus response, saying that Trump has in fact appointed numerous experts to address the issue. Sanders responded by mocking Trump's claim to have a ""natural ability"" to address disasters. ""You listen to the scientists; you don't say stupid things,"" Sanders said. ""You don't suggest to people they can go to work."" Sanders returned to his talking points about the wealthiest people not paying their ""fair share"" in taxes, leading MacCallum to probe whether Sanders would reconsider his policies given the ongoing stock market crisis. SANDERS RELEASES DETAILS ON HOW HE'D PAY FOR MAJOR PROPOSALS -- ARE THERE ISSUES? ""I will not become president until January, and the economic situation will be different then,"" Sanders said. As to what he would do if he were president today, Sanders said an ""economic stimulus"" could come in the form of ""invest[ing] in working-class people in good-paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure – roads, bridges."" He added that ""I'm not here to demonize anybody,"" after MacCallum pointed out that Bill Gates is contributing substantially to coronavirus efforts. At the same time, Sanders said, it was absurd to depend upon the ""generosity"" of billionaires. Then, in a dramatic call-and-response moment with the audience at the town hall, Sanders established that Canada is not a socialist or communist system of government and yet manages to provide government-run health care at a minimal cost to patients. The president, for his part, has derided Canada's health-care system and pointed out that even Canadians complain about their long waiting times, relatively substandard care, and high taxes. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders joins moderators Martha MacCallum and Bret Baier for a Fox News town hall in Dearborn, Michigan. The Vermont senator acknowledged that taxes would go up by 4 percent at a minimum to incomes over $29,000, in addition to more payroll taxes on employers and stock market transaction taxes, but asserted that ""comprehensive"" health care is worth it. Sanders said he wanted a ""modest"" tax on ""Wall Street speculation."" The proposal, according to Sanders' campaign, specifically would place a ""0.5 percent tax on stock trades – 50 cents on every $100 of stock – a 0.1 percent fee on bond trades, and a 0.005 percent fee on derivative trades."" Sanders' campaign has claimed that a ""modest tax on Wall Street speculation ... will raise an estimated $2.4 trillion over 10 years"" and, in one fell swoop, make all ""public colleges, universities and trade schools tuition-free ... and cancel all student debt over the next decade."" However, the National Review has likened a tax on so-called ""Wall Street speculation"" to a de facto tax on savings, and asserted the Sanders plan is untested and ""would mean paying $25 to the federal government every time you traded $5,000 worth of stock — or five times what you’d pay the typical online brokerage in fees. ... Over the long term, that imposes serious costs on actively traded funds such as the ones containing many Americans’ retirement funds.""       Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rev. Jesse Jackson wave to the crowd at a rally for Sanders at Calder Plaza in Grand Rapids, Michigan on Sunday, March 8, 2020. Michigan's presidential primary is Tuesday. (Anntaninna Biondo/The Grand Rapids Press via AP)       At the town hall, Sanders alluded to a disputed Yale University study to argue that ""Medicare-for-all"" would save money largely by cutting down on administrative costs. Other nonpartisan estimates have put the cost of Sanders' ""Medicare-for-all"" proposal at over $32 trillion. Baier and MacCallum moderated Sanders’ second Fox News Town Hall of the election cycle. At last April's event, a combative Sanders made no apologies for his wealth, and acknowledged that his plans would lead to tax hikes for many Americans. Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington will also hold primaries on Tuesday, and a combined 352 delegates will be at stake. Michigan's 125 pledged delegates are the day's biggest prize and offer Sanders an opportunity to cut down front-runner Joe Biden's current 91-delegate lead. SANDERS HIRES ADVISOR WHO BLAMED AMERICA FOR 9/11 Sanders won the Michigan primary over Hillary Clinton in 2016 after taking a beating on Super Tuesday, but this year, surveys show him down by as many as two-dozen points. Biden tops Sanders 51 percent to 36 percent among likely Democratic presidential primary voters in Michigan, a Monmouth University survey released on Monday showed. An outstanding question going into Tuesday is whether Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who dropped out of the race last week, will endorse Biden or Sanders. So far, she's declined to back either, an especially frustrating development for Sanders, who could use Warren's help in unifying progressives in much the same way Biden has been able to rally moderates. Sanders tells Fox News he wouldn't close US borders during coronavirus-type contagion Sanders has scoffed at suggestions he could drop out if he doesn't win Michigan, but his travel schedule underscores its importance. He canceled a trip to Mississippi and instead made five campaign stops across Michigan since Friday. And he held a roundtable in Detroit on Monday with health experts to discuss the spread of the new coronavirus. Sanders has accused Biden of relying on billionaires to finance his campaign but also says he's now running against “the Democratic establishment.” The senator told Fox News on Sunday that he'd win Michigan and repeated that at a rally in Grand Rapids, but he added the major caveat for supporters that he'd only pull it off “if we stick together, we bring our friends out to vote.” FLASHBACK: AT TESTY FNC TOWN HALL, SANDERS MAKES NO APOLOGIES FOR MAKING MILLIONS Sanders won't say if he's personally lobbying Warren for her endorsement. He did manage to secure the backing of Jesse Jackson, who said it was no time for centrist compromise. “With the exception of Native Americans, African-Americans are the people who are most behind socially and economically in the United States and our needs are not moderate,"" Jackson said at Sanders' Grand Rapids rally. “A people far behind cannot catch up choosing the most moderate path.” Still, one of Sanders' highest-profile supporters, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, struck a far more conciliatory tone addressing 10,000-plus on the campus of the University of Michigan on Sunday night, saying, “In order for us to win, we have to grow.”       President Donald Trump gestures while walking on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington on Monday after stepping off Marine One. A “Women for Trump” bus tour has been canceled, the president’s campaign said, citing scheduling conflicts. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)       “We must be inclusive. We must bring more people into this movement,"" she said, urging Sanders supporters to shed “cynicism and exclusion” and “turn with an embracing posture, where all people are welcome in a people's movement.” Sanders is hoping to do well in Washington state on Tuesday, but could face hurdles in Mississippi and Missouri. Sanders' team acknowledges he will also struggle in next week's Florida primary, where the senator's past defense of Fidel Castro looms large. He also could face long odds in Ohio and Illinois — especially if he underperforms in Michigan. Both of those states also vote March 17. The wild card next week could be Arizona, where Sanders will be counting on strong Latino support, which lifted him to victory in California. MARCH 10 PRIMARY PRIMER: THE STATES AND THE STAKES The intricate arithmetic of how delegates are won makes it possible Tuesday for a winning candidate to reap a bigger haul of delegates with a smaller margin of victory than any other night. This gives Biden an opportunity to greatly increase his lead over Sanders or for Sanders to close the gap. Delegates are mostly awarded proportionally in congressional districts. And nearly two-thirds of Tuesday districts have an odd number of delegates up for grabs. When there is an odd number of delegates available, that means one of the two candidates will get more delegates. In districts with an even number of delegates, proportional distribution means that in close races, both candidates get the same number of delegates and that makes it more difficult for Sanders to catch Biden. After March 17, most delegates are in districts with an even number of delegates. Monday's Sanders Fox News Town Hall was the eleventh town hall of the current election season hosted by Fox News and the tenth with a Democratic presidential candidate. FNC’s first town hall with Sanders held the record for the most-watched town hall of the 2020 election cycle with nearly 2.6 million viewers, before Trump's town hall dethroned it with a whopping 4.2 million viewers. Recent Fox News town halls were held with then-Democratic presidential candidates Mike Bloomberg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, both co-moderated by Baier and MacCallum, as well as former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, moderated by Chris Wallace.

"                          We can't find any evidence of coronavirus symptoms among the 10,000 CPAC attendees, says Matt Schlapp, American Conservative Union Chair. Staffers for the Conservative Political Action Conference have reached out to over 100 people who may have come into contact with an individual who tested positive for coronavirus after attending the annual summit at the end of February, Fox News has learned. The steps are part of a behind-the-scenes scramble to respond to the development that has rattled an already-shaken Washington. As the Trump administration and lawmakers scrounge up funding, plan for a national health care response, and grapple with the prospect of a public panic on top of financial market chaos, the presence of a virus-infected individual at the premier conservative gathering only added to an epic logistical challenge. TWO GOP REPS SELF-QUARANTINE AFTER CONTACT WITH CORONAVIRUS PATIENT AT CPAC The top levels of government on the GOP side – President Trump, Vice President Pence, cabinet officials, top-ranking lawmakers – were in attendance. Staffers quickly worked to figure out who may have come in contact with the still-unnamed person. These discussions so far have led to several lawmakers going into self-quarantine as a precaution, amid assurances from organizers that nobody else has yet gotten sick from this individual. But those unusual announcements are just a window into the ongoing efforts to trace potential exposure. Coronavirus patients attending the American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference in Washington last week led to similar concerns, though not quite to this degree. A senior CPAC staffer told Fox News on Tuesday that they and members of their team have been in touch with more than 100 attendees — in addition to the “several” lawmakers known to have interacted with the individual. The infected attendee, who reports indicate is a New York City-based doctor, is currently in a hospital in Englewood, N.J. CPAC would not share or confirm the identity of the individual. New Jersey officials on Tuesday announced the state's first novel coronavirus-related death, but Fox News is told this is not the same individual who attended CPAC. The senior CPAC staffer told Fox News that they have been in regular contact with the individual, as well as his brother, to learn of his condition, and find out if he remembers coming into contact with any additional attendees. The staffer told Fox News that CPAC organizers had asked for the attendee’s phone to go through themselves, but were denied. Nevertheless, they're using the brother as an intermediary to learn more about his contacts. On Monday, the individual’s brother shared with CPAC staffers that he had gone through the phone and uncovered a photo of him with Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga. – who is now in self-quarantine, along with several other lawmakers who came into contact with the patient. A spokesperson for Collins confirmed that Matt Schlapp – chairman of CPAC host the American Conservative Union – contacted the congressman to notify him of the uncovered photo. On Monday, the attending physician for Congress said in a statement that the sick attendee, who was able to recall the majority of individuals he interacted with, came into contact with ""several"" members of Congress. The list of lawmakers going into self-quarantine, as a result, has grown by the day. WHITE HOUSE TAKING 'COMMON SENSE STEPS' TO CURB CORONAVIRUS RISK AT MEETINGS At this time, Schlapp, Collins, Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and now-acting White House chief of staff Mark Meadows are in self-quarantine ""out of an abundance of caution"" after being notified by CPAC organizers that they came into contact with the ill attendee. Three senior members of Gosar’s staff are also self-quarantined. None of the lawmakers, or staffers, are known to be experiencing coronavirus symptoms at this time. The response has fed complaints – including from some in the media – that only high-powered officials are getting to learn whether they were at risk of exposure. But the CPAC staffer told Fox News that not only have they sent mass emails to all attendees of the annual conference and contacted certain lawmakers, but they've contacted dozens of people who are not elected officials – as well as members of the media who were covering the event. Meanwhile, the chain of events has fed speculation about whether Trump himself was at risk, as both the president and Pence attended and spoke at the conference. The White House said there is no indication that Trump or Pence was in close proximity to the stricken attendee. The president did, however, spend time with Collins and Gaetz since CPAC. Collins shook Trump's hand and joined him for a visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Ga., on Friday. He also met with Trump at the White House last week, several days after the Feb. 26-29 conference. Gaetz was spotted riding on Air Force One on Monday as he learned the news. White House officials said when Gaetz learned he was in proximity to the man with coronavirus at CPAC, he sat by himself in a section of the president's plane. Meanwhile, Trump downplayed the threat of coronavirus on Monday, noting that the “common flu” kills thousands of Americans each year and that “life & the economy go on.” “So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year,” Trump tweeted Monday. ""Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus with 22 deaths. Think about that!” According to the CDC, during the 2018-2019 flu season in the U.S., an estimated 35.5 million people were sick with influenza and approximately 34,200 people died from the illness.

"                          Bret Baier, Special Report anchor, discusses why President Trump's handling of coronavirus and its economic consequences is his biggest test heading into November The chairman of the House Democratic caucus blasted President Trump Tuesday for retreating to his Mar-a-Lago golf club with his ""billionaire boys club"" during the coronavirus crisis and then blaming Democrats for not doing enough. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries took issue with Trump's tweet that accused Democrats of not doing enough to respond to the economic effects of the spreading virus before heading to recess next week.       Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)       ""Donald Trump was at a Florida golf resort hanging out with the billionaire boys club in the midst of a global epidemic,"" Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Tuesday when asked about Trump's criticism. ""So we're not going to be lectured by Donald Trump about leadership when he's failed to show a scintilla of it in the midst of this whole crisis.” Trump wants Congress to pass economic stimulus measures to stem economic bleeding from the coronavirus outbreak, including a payroll tax cut, small business aid and help for hourly workers who might become sick. The House and Senate already passed an $8.3 billion aid package to boost the U.S. health care system to respond to the virus. Democrats Tuesday said any economic stimulus plan should be focused on workers, such as expanded sick leave, unemployment benefits, food assistance and health care access. CORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN Their proposals were just coming in focus and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, of California, and other Democrats doubted a vote would be ready this week before they leave Washington for a planned recess. ""In other words, it's off to vacation for the Do Nothing Democrats,"" Trump tweeted Tuesday. ""That's been the story with them for 1 1/2 years!"" Trump spent the weekend at his golf club in Florida where well-heeled Republicans huddled for a fundraising retreat. He visited the Capitol Tuesday to meet with Senate Republicans about the payroll tax cut plans. ""We have a coronavirus that has killed thousands of people throughout the world already,"" Jeffries said. ""We have a stock market that is in complete freefall. We may be heading into a recession.

"                          President Trump addresses the media following meeting with lawmakers on coronavirus at Capitol Hill. President Trump urged Americans to remain calm Tuesday as the government responds to the global outbreak of coronavirus. The president, after meeting with Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill, warned that Americans should exercise caution, but that the situation is being handled and will eventually be resolved. CORONAVIRUS 'CONTAINMENT ZONE' IN NEW YORK COUNTY TO SHUT DOWN FOR 2 WEEKS, UNDERGO CLEANING “We’re prepared and we’re doing a great job with it and it will go away,"" Trump said. “Everybody has to be vigilant and has to be careful, but be calm."" Trump praised his administration's response, saying they ""are doing a fantastic job,"" and referred to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who stated that the federal government has provided everything he has requested from them. Trump himself has yet to be tested, and he said the White House doctor told him there was no reason to do so. This comes after it was discovered that someone at the Conservative Political Action Conference was stricken with coronavirus. Trump attended that summit at the end of last month. ""I don't think it's a big deal,"" Trump said, adding he feels ""extremely good."" Democrats are preparing a package of aid that includes unemployment insurance and sick pay for working families struggling to keep paychecks coming as the outbreak disrupts workplaces and the stock market tumbled Monday. A vote could come as soon as this week or push to mid-March. CORONAVIRUS AT CPAC: DIAGNOSIS TRIGGERS SCRAMBLE TO TRACE EXPOSURE House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., implored lawmakers to keep working to strengthen the country's defenses. Meanwhile, lawmakers were given new instructions on how to protect themselves at the Capitol, with the House's attending physician asking them to stop shaking hands or touching people during greetings – he recommended the split-fingers Star Trek greeting instead. Trump met health insurers at the White House earlier and vowed to help the beleaguered cruise-ship and airline industries. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo also called on the National Guard to help contain a coronavirus ""cluster"" in New Rochelle, located in Westchester County north of New York City.

"                          Jessica Tarlov and Josh Holmes discuss Joe Biden's delegate lead and what Bernie Sanders needs to do to change the momentum **Want FOX News Halftime Report in your inbox every day? Sign up here.**YOUR SKINNY TUESDAY RACE GUIDEDETROIT — Democrats, who once marveled at the sheer enormity of their presidential field like East Germans at an American supermarket, don’t have much left in the way of candidate choices.It’s down to two guys who have been in the principal rival wings of the party since the Vietnam War. And right now, it’s not looking any better for the Yippies than it did back in ‘68.Far out.But if Democrats can’t do much now to change the tune, today they can at least set the tempo.Front-runner Joe Biden is a little bit more than a third of the way to the 1,991 delegates he needs to win the Democratic nomination outright. A big finish today would put Biden more than halfway home even before a majority of delegates have been allocated – an up-tempo number to an early clinch.If Biden doesn’t build on his Super Tuesday surge, however, it could mean a repeat of 2016’s grinding, embittering Democratic contest, with Bernie Sanders’ chasing him to the last contests or, conceivably, even revive the prospect of a contested convention. That sounds more like a work song or even a funeral march.The map today looks good for Biden – as you will see in the tables below. Michigan is the big prize, and it, like Missouri, boasts a large African-American population as well as a significant number of suburbanites: Both keys to his Super Tuesday resurrection last week.Sanders isn’t even bothering to contest Mississippi, where as much as three quarters of the electorate today may be African-American.Sanders is mostly looking out West, where he performed well last week and last cycle – particularly to Washington. He won there in 2016 and the Pacific Northwest has remained a hotbed of Bernie-ism. But there’s considerable downside this time around.The Evergreen State is holding its first presidential primary since 2000, ditching the low-turnout caucus system that helped Sanders and his activist core so much four years ago. In the non-binding primary vote on the ballot in 2016, the result flipped with Clinton winning an easy victory. It’s a similar story in delegate-light Idaho, where Democrats haven’t had a primary since 1984.Sanders’ best shot is in North Dakota, which has maintained the caucus system for awarding its handful of delegates. It was big for Bernie in 2016.If Biden does about as well in the six states holding contests today as his middling average performance in the first 18 states, he would win something shy of 180 delegates. That’s basically meeting the minimum requirement to become his party’s nominee on the first ballot.Let’s call this “The Clintonista.” In this scenario, Biden would do as his predecessor Hillary Clinton did before him: He’d perform at the low end of the acceptable range but not well enough to officially clinch the nomination and dispatch Sanders for another couple of months.That would give Sanders (and the Trump campaign) plenty of time to raise doubts and sew discord ahead of a fraught but anticlimactic convention in Milwaukee. It would also give Biden plenty of time to deepen doubts about his own candidacy. Every debate and every interview Biden would be obliged to do would run the risk of deepening the inevitable buyers’ remorse that voters will feel.If Biden falls much short of that mark, the prospects of a contested convention will rear up like on Democrats like a bad pastrami sandwich. Let’s call that one “The Milwaukee Two Step.” It seems unlikely given the rush we’re seeing toward Biden, but that’s Sanders’ only chance today to credibly keep alive the idea of a convention battle that results in his nomination.But the one that Biden and the rest of the mainstream Democrats are hoping for is a win big enough to relegate Sanders to gadfly status and let Biden go home and rest for a grueling general election. That would mean the front-runner consolidating the support that went to Michael Bloomberg last week, keeping turnout high and snagging two thirds of the available delegates.If Biden hauls out 230 or so delegates out of today it will be a happy Irish tune for him: “The Scranton Reel.”MICHIGAN (125 PLEDGED DELEGATES)OPEN PRIMARYLAST POLLS CLOSE AT 9 PM ETPast results - 2008: Primary not sanctioned by DNC; 2016: Clinton 48.3 percent, Sanders 49.72016 general election - Trump 47.3 percent, Clinton 47 percentOther key races on the ballot today - NoneRace notes - Michigan will be the biggest prize today and it’s clear by the amount of attention the state has been receiving from both campaigns. While Sanders is hoping to repeat his stunning upset 2016 victory in the Wolverine State, recent polling shows a strong lead for Biden. Sanders garners a lot of support from younger voters and members of the Arab American community, but his campaign struggles with support from African Americans, suburban women and voters outside of metro Detroit, which could be his downfall in Michigan. Voter turnout in 2016 broke state records at 2.5 million when there was an open seat for president in addition to competitive down ballot races in both parties. Sanders needs younger voters to come out in force, or Biden could be well on his way to the nomination.WASHINGTON (89 PLEDGED DELEGATES)CLOSED PRIMARYLAST POLLS CLOSE AT 11 PM ETPast results - 2008: Obama 67.6 percent, Clinton 31.2 percent; 2016: Sanders 72.7 percent, Clinton 27.1 percent2016 general election - Clinton 52.5 percent, Trump 36.8 percentOther key races on the ballot today - NoneRace notes - Washington moved up its primary in an effort to take on a more active role in the primary process, but that hasn’t seemed to work out. The two remaining campaigns have little activity on the ground, with no official watch parties scheduled for tonight. A reason for campaign absence could be due to the large number of diagnosed Coronavirus cases in the state. But, thanks to the states all-mail election, voters are expected to be active nonetheless. State elections officials say they’re looking at a robust possible voter turnout record with reports of nearly 1.6 million ballots already in – about 35 percent of the state’s registered voters – as of Monday afternoon.MISSOURI (68 PLEDGED DELEGATES)OPEN PRIMARYLAST POLLS CLOSE AT 8 PM ETPast results - 2008: Obama 49.3 percent, Clinton 47.9 percent; 2016: Clinton 49.6 percent, Sanders 49.4 percent2016 general election - Trump 56.4 percent, Clinton 37.9 percentOther key races on the ballot today - NoneRace notes - While Biden holds solid support from the I-70 corridor from Kansas City to mid-Missouri and St. Louis, Sanders is trying to offset it with support from the rural northern and southern parts of the state. Biden has the backing of the Democratic establishment in the state including an endorsement from Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, one of the state’s ten Superdelegates. Sanders benefits from high volunteer numbers and a base of supporters that have been with him since his narrow loss in 2016. The delegate count today will be determined as follows: The statewide vote will determine 24 delegates while the other 44 will be distributed based on the results in each congressional district.MISSISSIPPI (36 PLEDGED DELEGATES)OPEN PRIMARYLAST POLLS CLOSE AT 8 PM ETPast results - 2008: Obama 61.2 percent, Clinton 36.7 percent; 2016: Clinton 82.5 percent, Sanders 16.6 percent 2016 general election - Trump 57.9 percent, Clinton 40.1 percentOther key races on the ballot today - All four U.S. House members will face primary challenges today: Rep. Trent Kelly, (R), Rep. Bennie Thompson (D), Rep. Michael Guest (R) and Rep. Steven Palazzo (R).  On the Senate side, incumbent Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith is running for her first full six-year term after beating Democrat Mike Espy in the 2018 special election. It is expected that she will face Espy again come November.Race notes - If there is any state to expect a Biden landslide, it’s Mississippi. After the former vice president’s solid performance so far in the South we don’t expect anything less today. Watch for the possibility of Sanders falling short of the viability threshold and a Biden delegate sweep.IDAHO (20 PLEDGED DELEGATES)CLOSED PRIMARYLAST POLLS CLOSE AT 11 PM ETPast results - 2008: Obama 79.5 percent, Clinton 17.2 percent; 2016: Sanders 78 percent, Clinton 21.2 percent2016 general election - Trump 59.3 percent, Clinton 27.5 percentOther key races on the ballot today - NoneRace notes - Idawho? Democrats have mostly ignored the predominantly red Gem State. So much so that none of the candidates attended the state Democratic Party’s key event, the Frank and Bethine Church Gala, last weekend. The Biden and Sanders campaigns both sent video messages and surrogates to represent them instead. Sanders is expected to do well after his strong performance in 2016 in addition to his money spent on ads in the state, where Biden hasn’t spent a dime.

"                          Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday upheld a ruling that allows House Democrats to view secret grand jury information from Robert Mueller’s Russia probe that had been redacted from his report. The court’s 2-1 decision agreed with a lower court that the House Judiciary Committee can obtain the information for impeachment investigations of President Trump under an exception for “judicial proceedings,” per the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. DEVIN NUNES RESPONDS TO CHRISTOPHER STEELE DEFENSE OF DOSSIER: 'PREPOSTEROUS' “[B]ecause that exception encompasses impeachment proceedings and the committee has established a ‘particularized need’ for the grand jury materials, the order of the district court is affirmed,” Judge Judith Rogers wrote in the court’s opinion.                 The lower court had claimed that precedent supported the idea that an impeachment trial is akin to a judicial proceeding, citing a case that allowed the disclosure of grand jury material for the impeachment investigation of President Richard Nixon. Rogers noted that the exception to the grand jury secrecy rule applies in cases “preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding,” and that the party requesting it must show a “particularized need.” The Department of Justice argued that the precedent the lower court cited was not binding, but the D.C. Circuit disagreed. The Circuit Court also agreed that the lower court properly used its discretion in determining that the possibility of new articles of impeachment stemming from the grand jury materials satisfied the requirement for a “particularized need.” FISA COURT BLOCKS FBI AGENTS LINKED TO CARTER PAGE PROBE FROM SEEKING WIRETAPS, OTHER SURVEILLANCE The court’s ruling also noted that the lower court properly concluded that the need to keep the information secret “is reduced by the committee’s adoption of special protocols to restrict access to the grand jury materials in order to maintain their secrecy.” The DOJ, opposing the House Democrats, argued that because Trump had already been impeached and acquitted by the time the court was to rule, there was no longer a basis for the committee needing the information. The committee responded by claiming that their investigation was still continuing and that new articles of impeachment remained a possibility. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The DOJ has the option to now either petition for the case to be reheard by the entire D.C. Circuit in an en banc hearing, or immediately appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. The department has yet to comment on their next step, and spokesperson Kerri Kupec said the DOJ is “reviewing the decision.” Fox News’ David Spunt and Jake Gibson contributed to this report.

"                          Dr. Janette Nesheiwat on what this means for the American people. President Trump on Thursday shrugged off complaints by European Union leaders that they were not consulted before he announced travel restrictions from Europe due to coronavirus -- arguing that the E.U. doesn’t alert the U.S. when it raises tariffs. “We get along well with the European leaders, but we had to make a decision and I didn’t want to take time, and it takes a long time to make the individual calls,” he said in the Oval Office, alongside Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, before adding that he had spoken to some EU leaders before the announcement. EUROPEAN UNION LASHES OUT AT TRUMP OVER TRAVEL BAN AMID CORONAVIRUS CHAOS “But we had to move quickly, I mean when they raise taxes on us, they don’t consult us and I think that’s probably one and the same,” he added. Trump announced late Wednesday that travel from Europe would be restricted for 30 days -- although the U.K. and Ireland are not included. The Department of Homeland Security went on to clarify that it affects most foreign nationals who were in Europe’s passport-free “Schengen Area” within 14 days prior to traveling to the U.S. The area in question consists of 26 countries, including France, Italy, German, Greece, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Norway, and Sweden. The Trump administration had slapped a travel ban on foreign nationals who had visited China and Iran last month. But EU leaders were furious, saying that the global pandemic requires “cooperation rather than unilateral action.” “The European Union disapproves of the fact that the U.S. decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation,” EU Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement. “The European Union is taking strong action to limit the spread of the virus.” CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW Europe has been struggling to get a grip on the crisis, which has virtually shut down countries such as Italy and Denmark. Already, more than 17,000 cases of COVID-19 have been detected in Europe, with the virus having been found in all 27 EU countries. Trump justified the exclusion of the U.K., saying the U.S. ally was doing a “very good job” of combating the crisis. “The U.K. basically has got the border, strong borders and they're doing a very good, job, they don't have much infection and hopefully they'll keep it that way,” he said. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is a close ally of Trump, who has in turn supported Johson's push to take Britain out of the European Union. Trump also said he hopes that the ban will be something that can be ended fairly soon, and said the administration had taken quick action on the ban, similar to that with China. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""We went very early with Europe and I think that will likewise be very good and get it back very quickly,” he said. He went on to call the virus a ""fast spreader"" and that while it is a global crisis, ""you do need separation in some cases."" Varadkar told reporters that his country was shutting down schools and limiting large gatherings as part of an effort to prevent the virus from spreading in the country. There were indications that some European countries were following Trump’s lead. Czech Republic Prime Minister Andrej Babis said people from 13 risk countries that include E.U. countries such as Italy, Spain, France, Austria and Germany as well Britain will not be allowed to enter the country.

"                          Joe Biden lays out his plan to battle coronavirus by calling out President Trump for 'disparaging science' and damaging relationships around the world Joe Biden is shaking up his operation and replacing his Democratic presidential campaign manager as he tries to finish his primary fight with Bernie Sanders to win the Democratic nomination and look ahead to a general election battle ahead with President Trump. The former vice president’s campaign announced Thursday that Jen O’Malley Dillon -- a veteran of Barack Obama’s 2008 and 2012 campaigns and who most recently served as former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s presidential campaign manager -- will succeed Greg Schultz in steering Biden’s White House bid. BIDEN HOLDS MASSIVE LEAD OVER SANDERS IN FLORIDA POLL Biden officials said Schultz will now focus on “organizational planning for the general election and continuing to bolster the campaign’s external outreach.” The move comes as Biden has taken a large lead over Democratic nomination rival Sanders in the crucial race for convention delegates. That's come thanks to major victories in the South Carolina primary and the Super Tuesday states, and this week in Michigan, Missouri, and Mississippi. While Sanders – the populist senator from Vermont – remains in the race, his window to win the nomination is closing fast. “I am grateful to Greg for his leadership and hard work to help get our campaign where it is today, and I will value his continued input on this campaign,” Biden said in a statement.       The former vice president’s campaign announced Thursday that Jen O’Malley Dillon -- a veteran of <a data-cke-saved-href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/barack-obama"" href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/barack-obama"">Barack Obama</a>’s 2008 and 2012 campaigns and who most recently served as former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s presidential campaign manager -- will succeed Greg Schultz in steering Biden’s White House bid.        But before his rebound in South Carolina, Biden’s White House effort was almost left for dead after disappointing fourth and fifth places finishes in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, the first two contests in the presidential nominating calendar. There’s been grumbling inside and outside the campaign over a lack of resources, organizational issues, and especially disappointing fundraising dating back to last April when Biden announced his candidacy. Biden praised O’Malley Dillon, saying he’s “thrilled that Jen is bringing her considerable talent and insight to this team. She will be a tremendous asset to a campaign that is only growing and getting stronger as we prepare to take the fight to Donald Trump this fall.” THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN O’Malley Dillon joined the Biden campaign last month, assisting in the Nevada effort, where Biden started to turn things around with a distant but second-place finish behind Sanders. She served as the battleground states director on Obama’s 2008 campaign, deputy campaign manager on the president’s 2012 re-election effort and was named as Obama’s first executive director at the Democratic National Committee. “Like so many other Democrats who are unifying behind Joe Biden’s character and leadership, I’m excited to join the team at this critical moment,” O’Malley Dillon said as she spotlighted the tidal wave of support by current and former Democratic federal and state lawmakers the past two weeks as much of the party coalesced around Biden. Should Biden lock up the nomination, he will face the combined efforts of the Trump re-election and the Republican National Committee, which has a massive financial and organizational advantage over Biden’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee.

"                          World Health Organization declares coronavirus a pandemic as spread continues. As the novel coronavirus outbreak has spread around the world and into the United States, governments, private organizations and other institutions have been taking precautions to stymie the spread of the disease. At least 90 major universities are moving to all online classes or closing. Local districts are canceling school. The NBA has put its season on hold. And New York has set up a containment zone with a one-mile radius in New Rochelle, which has been a hotspot for coronavirus cases. In one of the most striking moves to prevent the spread of the coronavirus yet, the NCAA announced Wednesday that it would hold its annual March Madness basketball tournament -- which produces the vast majority of its yearly revenue -- without any fans in attendance. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW The federal government has also taken precautions against the coronavirus. Here are some of the ways the U.S. government has been affected as it takes measures to protect its own employees from the respiratory disease. Capitol closed, tours suspended The White House, the Pentagon and the U.S. Capitol have suspended tours as the number of coronavirus cases in the U.S. continues to increase. While the White House did not mention the coronavirus in its announcement that all tours of the building that serves as both the president's residence and office are temporarily suspended, the House and Senate Sergeants at Arms issued a joint memo informing members that it was shutting down all tours, ""including Member and staff-led tours,"" beginning Thursday evening. NEW ROCHELLE TURNS INTO GHOST TOWN AMID CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK BEFORE NATIONAL GUARD'S ARRIVAL It has also closed the building to all members of the public except ""members, staff and official business visitors."" ""In consultation with the Office of Attending Physician and Leadership, effective at 5:00 p.m. on March 12, 2020, the House and Senate Sergeant at Arms have ordered limited access,"" the memo reads. ""This limited access is anticipated to remain in effect until 8:00 a.m. April 1, 2020, and is to protect the health and safety of Members, staff and visitors."" Closed offices The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) became the first major federal agency earlier this week to ask its staff to telecommute after an employee received treatment for respiratory symptoms. Then, later in the week, multiple members of Congress began closing their D.C. offices, led by Rep. Julia Brownley, D-Calif., and followed shortly thereafter by Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. CORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN ""The Wuhan coronavirus is a grave challenge to our great nation. My first priority is always the safety of our people,"" Cotton said in a statement. ""From the beginning, I have heeded the counsel of Benjamin Franklin: an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement Thursday that he ""fully support[s] the decision of these nonpartisan officers,"" while House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., called on Congress to stay in session until it passes a second coronavirus funding bill that both Republicans and Democrats are comfortable with. There is an upcoming district work period for members next week that may be put on hold while Congress hashes out its difference on coronavirus legislation. Members of Congress in self-quarantine While no members of Congress have tested positive for the coronavirus yet, several members have self-quarantined after they learned that they had been exposed to an infected person. This heavily affected Republican members who attended the CPAC conference two weeks ago, where one person who attended was later revealed to have been infected. TRUMP'S TRAVEL BAN: TRAVELERS IN EUROPE, US EXPERIENCE CONFUSION AT AIRPORTS AMID CORONAVIRUS RESTRICTIONS Among those members who temporarily cut themselves off from interactions with their staffs, colleagues and the public are Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., Rep Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., and Cruz. Gaetz, who had come into contact with President Trump before he found out he had been in contact with the infected person at CPAC, tested negative for the coronavirus. Brownley also self-quarantined after she learned that she'd come into contact with someone who tested positive for the coronavirus. Rep. Louis Gohmert, R-Texas, learned that he'd come into contact with an infected person but was cleared to return to Washington. Incoming Trump chief of staff, Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., also self-quarantined himself earlier this week after learning he came into contact with the infected person at CPAC. News broke Thursday afternoon that Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., also self-quarantined after meeting with a member of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's delegation who later tested positive for the coronavirus. ""The [Brazilian] Embassy said the person had no symptoms leading up to or the day of the conference,"" Scott said in a press release. ""After consulting with the Senate’s attending physician and my personal doctor, I have been told that my risk is low, and I don’t need to take a test or quarantine. However, the health and safety of the American people is my focus and I have made the decision to self-quarantine in an abundance of caution. I am feeling healthy and not experiencing any symptoms at this time."" Staff precautions Before a wave of office closings later in the week, some senior congressional staffers were stressing over how to protect their members from the coronavirus as congressional leaders seemed reluctant to interrupt business as usual in the Capitol Building. Democrats and Republicans are currently hashing out a second spending bill dedicated to fighting the coronavirus. LAWMAKERS MISSING VOTES, CANCELING TRIPS AND TOWN HALLS AS CORONAVIRUS CONCERNS SPREAD An internal memo written by a congressional chief of staff obtained by Fox News Wednesday showed at least one office was taking expansive measures to protect its member, who is a senior citizen. The memo, which redacts the member's name, emphasizes in bold: ""That said — it is absolutely imperative that we limit [redacted]’s’ (and our own) physical contact as much as possible during the coming weeks — no handshakes, no hugs, no kissing, keeping appropriate distance from others, etc. [Redacted] should also not be touching people for photo ops. As staff — we are the first line of defense for [redacted]. That is why I am imploring every staffer who is with [redacted] at events to encourage responsible distancing — for [redacted] protection and yours."" State and DOD travel restrictions Both the Department of Defense and the U.S. State Department are restricting travel for employees in the wake of President Trump's announcement Wednesday night that the U.S. would ban travel from Europe to the United States. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In a Wednesday night press release, the DOD said it will prohibit any travel by service members to ""Level 3"" countries as assigned by the CDC and prevent family members of those in the military and civilian military personnel from traveling to ""Level 2"" countries. It also requires DOD personnel who are returning to the U.S. from ""Level 2"" or ""Level 3"" countries to remain in their homes for 14 days to monitor for any coronavirus symptoms. ""Level 3"" countries include China, Iran, South Korea, Italy and the continent of Europe. There is also a ""Level 3"" restriction to Venezuela, not because of the coronavirus but because of the lack of health infrastructure in the socialist country. On Wednesday night, the CDC also issued a global ""Level 2"" alert due to the worldwide spread of the coronavirus, which on Wednesday was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Reuters also reported Wednesday night that the State Department was suspending all non-essential travel for its staffers, citing anonymous sources.

"                          The coronavirs and its impact on the federal government from school closings to travel restrictions. The Supreme Court is closing its doors to the public indefinitely as concerns over the coronavirus pandemic spread across Washington. Citing “concern for the health and safety of the public and Supreme Court employees,” the public information office for the highest court in the country announced that it would be closing to the public Thursday until further notice. The building, however, will remain for official business and no case filling deadlines will be extended. The news comes shortly after Congress announced it is shutting the Capitol to the public until April in reaction to the spread of the coronavirus. CLICK HERE FOR ALL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE In a statement, the House and Senate sergeants-at-arms said congressional office buildings and the Congressional Visitor Center, through which tourists enter the Capitol, were also being shuttered. In an email to lawmakers' offices, the officials said the Capitol will be closed to all tours, including special ones led by House and Senate members and their aides. No tours will be permitted in the Capitol Visitor Center, a massive three-level underground structure, which opened in 2008 and greeted more than 21 million visitors through 2018. Only lawmakers, staff, journalists and visitors with official business will be permitted to enter the buildings. The closures begin at 5 p.m. EDT Thursday, and the buildings are scheduled to reopen on April 1. The officials said they were acting on the advice of District of Columbia health officials and of Congress' own doctors. President Trump's administration and Congress have struggled over how to react to the virus and COVID-19, the disease it can cause that in some cases can be deadly. Congressional leaders have had to balance conflicting desires of protecting lawmakers and staffs from getting sick with keeping one of the country's most visible public buildings open. White House tours have also been temporarily suspended. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP While comprehensive records about past closures of the Capitol weren't immediately available, the building is seldom closed completely to the public. No visitors were allowed immediately after a 1915 bomb threat against the building. And restrictions were placed on access to the visitors' galleries overlooking the House and the Senate in 1954 after Puerto Rican nationalists fired from the House gallery on lawmakers, wounding five of them. In the fall of 1918, the Capitol was closed briefly to visitors as the Spanish flu spread around the world, killing an estimated tens of millions of people. Around 1,000 people died in the Washington, D.C., region along with at least three members of the House, according to the chamber's historians' office.

"                          Fox News contributor Lawrence Jones says forcing Sen. Bernie Sanders out of the primary race would deprive Joe Biden of one-on-one debate experience and alienate the senator's supporters. Democratic voters will head to the polls Tuesday to vote in the party's first set of primaries after voters have the chance to see the last two remaining contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination -- former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders -- go head-to-head in a debate. Biden has taken control of the race after wins in 10 states on Super Tuesday and at least four states last Tuesday. He now holds a significant delegate lead over Sanders in what became essentially a one-on-one race after billionaire Mike Bloomberg and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren exited the race following Super Tuesday. Sanders admitted the March 10 primaries were not a good night for his campaign while saying he would stay in the race for the Democratic nomination on Wednesday. Tuesday's races, which award 15 percent of all delegates in the Democratic primary and will bring the number of delegates awarded in the Democratic race to 61 percent of the total delegates available, could be Sanders' last stand.       Democratic voters will head to the polls for the first time Tuesday after seeing Sanders and Biden go head-to-head in a debate.       BIDEN HOLDS MASSIVE LEAD OVER SANDERS IN FLORIDA: POLL Here are the states voting and the delegates at stake on Monday, March 17. Arizona There are 67 pledged delegates at stake in Arizona's Democratic presidential primary. The results in Arizona will be an important indicator, as Sanders has typically fared better in western states while Biden has excelled in more diverse states. Arizona, sitting on the U.S. southern border, is both western and diverse. Florida Florida is the biggest prize available on March 17, awarding 219 pledged delegates in all. A diverse swing state, a good performance in Florida will help Sanders or Biden make the case that they are the most electable Democrat to face President Trump in November. Illinois The home state of former President Barack Obama, Illinois will dole out 155 pledged delegates on March 17. Sanders laid some groundwork in Illinois earlier in the primary, visiting the state for three days to Biden's one as of March 11. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Ohio While Ohio only has the third-most delegates of the four states voting in the March 17 primaries, a win in the ever-important general election swing state could help Biden make himself seem even more like the inevitable nominee or help Sanders revive his campaign.

"                          Bill Hemmer breaks down county-by-county results from key Super Tuesday 2.0 states. Joe Biden solidified his hold on the Democratic presidential nomination, winning a pivotal victory in Michigan, which was once seen as a potential source of strength for Bernie Sanders.  Biden also scored a comfortable win in Missouri and a blowout in Mississippi, two states in which he was heavily favored.  The Fox News Voter Analysis surveys, conducted in Michigan, Mississippi, and Missouri, shed light on some of the key trends and dynamics in the Democratic race to take on Donald Trump in the fall. The numbers below may change slightly as more results come in.  BIDEN SURGES TO VICTORY ACROSS SUPER TUESDAY MAP The former vice president’s continuing strength with seniors, black voters, and political moderates propelled him to victory. His campaign’s momentum was particularly apparent among late-deciding voters, who he won by at least 40 percentage points in each state. Importantly for Biden, roughly one-quarter or more voters in each state said they had just recently made up their minds. Biden also significantly outperformed Sanders among suburban voters (winning by at least 20 points in each state) and those living in rural areas (winning by at least 30 points in each state). That included rural whites – a group that Democrats will try to win back in the general election.  Sanders’ base – young and self-identified “very liberal” voters – largely stuck with him, but he was unable to expand his coalition. As a result, more Democrats in each state said they would be satisfied with Biden as the nominee (between 76 percent in Missouri and 86 percent in Mississippi) than would be satisfied with Sanders (between 62 and 67 percent in each state).  Moreover, in an election centered on electability, Democrats felt Biden had a much better shot against Trump than Sanders.  Michigan Sanders’ surprise 2016 win in Michigan gave his campaign a much-needed shot of momentum, but he was unable to repeat the feat this year. Democratic primary voters under age 30 were still a source of strength for the Vermont Senator, but he won just 13 percent of seniors – and more than twice as many seniors turned out as young voters.  Sanders was also able to win “very liberal” Michiganders by 28 points but couldn’t recreate his 2016 performance among working-class whites. Instead, this important group went for Biden by a wide margin.  Biden also won convincingly among women (+28 points), black voters (+36 points), and moderates (+48 points). Michigan will likely be a pivotal swing state in November’s election, and fully eight-in-ten primary voters thought Biden could beat Donald Trump. Far fewer thought Sanders could prevail.  Most Biden voters said they would back the eventual Democratic nominee regardless of who won. Sanders voters were somewhat less certain, with roughly one-quarter saying their vote in November would depend on who won the nomination. Overall, eight-in-ten primary voters said they would definitely back the Democrat against Trump.  One positive sign for the president: almost half of Democratic primary voters in the Wolverine State favored increasing tariffs on goods imported to the U.S., which may suggest Trump’s economic approach will play well with the broader Michigan electorate.  Missouri Nearly half of Missouri Democratic primary voters said health care was the top issue facing the country, a record high in this year’s primary season. Nearly seven-in-ten Show Me State voters favored a Sanders-style single-payer health care system, second only to Iowa (72 percent) among states surveyed as part of the Fox News Voter Analysis to date.  That wasn’t enough for Sanders, however. Almost nine-in-ten voters backed a public option approach to insurance, and voters who said health care was the most important issue facing the country broke for Biden by nearly 20 points.  In the end, Sanders won those looking for a candidate who would fundamentally change the political system by 18 percentage points, voters under age 45 by 25 points, and “very liberal” voters by 30 points.  Biden had much larger advantages with his base, including moderates (+49 points), voters over age 45 (+55 points), and those looking for a candidate who would restore the political system to the way it worked before Trump (+72 points). Mississippi Mississippi was not particularly competitive – which Sanders telegraphed by canceling a planned rally there last week in order to spend more time in Michigan.  The demographics in Mississippi did not do Sanders any favors, as the state had the highest share of black voters and one of the lowest shares of voters under age 30 of any primary surveyed thus far.  Biden won almost every demographic and ideological group, and was particularly dominant among seniors (+55), black voters (+60), and moderates (+58). He even held a narrow edge among self-described “very liberal” voters (+12).  Seven-in-ten Mississippi primary voters identified as moderate or conservative, making it one of the least liberal states to vote thus far. That showed in Democratic primary voters’ views on social policies: a record-high 30 percent opposed legalizing marijuana, while almost half opposed legalizing abortion under any circumstances.  Methodology The Fox News Voter Analysis, conducted in partnership with the Associated Press, provides a comprehensive look at voting behavior, opinions and preferences as America votes. Surveys for the March 10th primary states were conducted in Michigan, Mississippi, and Missouri. The surveys were conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago the week before the primaries, concluding as polls closed. Interviews were conducted in English or Spanish. The survey is based on interviews with a random sample of registered voters drawn from the state voter file. In Michigan, these probability sample results were supplemented by interviews with self-identified registered voters recruited from nonprobability online panels. The sample sizes and margins of sampling error were 2,446 in Michigan (plus or minus 3.3 percentage points), 1,065 in Mississippi (plus or minus 4.9 percentage points), and 1,881 in Missouri (plus or minus 3.5 percentage points).

"                          Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden says the coronavirus pandemic does not have a political affiliation, requires a national response. Former Vice President Joe Biden on Thursday unveiled a plan to combat and overcome the coronavirus. Biden – the clear front-runner in the Democratic presidential nomination race over Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont – also criticized President Trump's efforts to date to curb the spread of the virus, or COVID-19, in the United States. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE CORONAVIRIUS OUTBREAK “Downplaying it, being overly dismissive, or spreading misinformation is only going to hurt us and further advantage the spread of the disease. But neither should we panic or fall back on xenophobia,” Biden said in a speech from his hometown of Wilmington, Del. “Labeling COVID-19 a foreign virus does not displace accountability for the misjudgments that have been taken thus far by the Trump administration,” Biden said as he took aim at the president for calling the pandemic a “foreign virus” in an Oval Office address Wednesday night that’s been criticized for a number of misstatements. Biden called for “decisive public health response to curb the spread of the disease and to provide treatment to those who need it.” He said his plan would ensure the wide availability of free testing, the elimination of all cost barriers for treatment and preventive care for COVID-19, the development of a vaccine and the deployment of supplies and personnel. The former vice president also called for the “decisive economic response to deliver real relief to American works, families, and small businesses that protects the economy.” Biden’s plan includes emergency paid leave for all those affected by the outbreak, including assistance to workers, families and small businesses that are hit hard by the economic upheaval.  Biden said that his plan is a “roadmap not for what I will do as president 10 months from now but for the leadership that I believe that is needed and required at this very moment.” And needling his likely opponent in November’s election, Biden said that “President Trump is welcome to adopt all of it.” THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN  Biden charged that “protecting the health and safety of the American people is the most important job of any president. Unfortunately, this virus laid bare the severe shortcomings of the current administration. Public fears are being compounded by pervasive lack of trust in this president, fueled by an adversarial relationship with truth that he continues to have. Our government’s ability to respond effectively has been undermined by hollowing out our agencies and disparagement of science.” Moments after the conclusion of Biden’s speech, the Trump re-election campaign returned fire, arguing that in the past Biden’s “shown terrible judgment and incompetence in the face of public health issues.” “The Obama White House had to publicly apologize for and clean up after Biden when his irresponsible remarks caused panic during the swine flu outbreak in 2009. Just weeks ago, he was openly critical of President Trump’s early move to restrict travel from China to the United States in response to the coronavirus – a decision which medical experts agree helped impede the spread of the virus to this country,” charged Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh. Biden’s campaign had announced on Wednesday that the former vice president would give the address Thursday afternoon on the coronavirus. The Sanders campaign announced just before Biden came before cameras that the senator would make his own address regarding the pandemic from his hometown of Burlington, Vt., later in the afternoon.

Sign up here.**On the roster: Coronanxiety nugget edition - I’ll Tell You What: Never tweet (for one week) - Biden shakes up campaign team - Florida cowCORONANXIETY NUGGET EDITIONAs Americans fret over whether they are too anxious about coronavirus or not anxious enough – coronanxiety anxiety – let’s keep it a little light today so you have plenty of time to Google “bulk Purell” and spray down flat surfaces.- The Democrats debate travails this cycle would be funny if they weren’t so sad, so it probably makes sense that they would end up with a figurative case of coronavirus. First, the debate scheduled for Sunday in Arizona was going forward, but with no audience. Then, for part of today, it seemed that it was going to be cancelled. That would have been great news for the party and frontrunner/almost-presumptive-nominee Joe Biden, who is not exactly the modern William F. Buckley of televised debate. But it would have been bad for host CNN and, most of all, second-place Bernie Sanders. Sanders all but promised Wednesday to bow out of the race after one more chance to damage Biden and the party’s chances in a final debate. So the debate will go on… sort of. CNN will host the two men in its Washington studios Sunday night so Sanders can get his last digs in.- One question looming over next week is how the virus response will affect the scheduled primaries in Florida, Illinois, Ohio and Arizona. It’s already changing the way state officials are conducting things and will obviously have major consequences for voter turnout. Will Bernie Sanders do better with his intense supporters having an outsized influence in smaller electorates? Will Joe Biden benefit from his seeming advantage among early voters so far this year? Like much of this crisis, we’ll only know when we get there.  - The Senate is cancelling its scheduled spring break recess in order to at least appear busy while their constituents are grappling with amateur epidemiology. Real action on a legislative response comes down to the administration cutting a deal with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. We’re sure there’ll be no problems there… lolz- The Capitol will be closed indefinitely to tours, which really is a shame. This is the time of year when busloads of students flood the city on class trips. As much as we hate the traffic, we love seeing young people learning about the republic. - Folks at the White House are dealing with the fact that President Trump was almost certainly exposed last weekend to coronavirus courtesy of an aide to Brazilian strongman Jair Bolsonaro on his visit to Trump’s Florida country club. (The aide who tested positive, Fabio Wajngarten, is a first-ballot inductee into the Halftime Report Name Hall of Fame. We may adopt it for our online alias.) With other world leaders stepping back from public events, there will be growing pressure on Trump to do the same. Whatever Trump opts to do, his aides have to be thinking about what the president’s Twitter feed would look like…- Speaking of things you shouldn’t say from quarantine, Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican congressman and honorary Trump who was among the many exposed to the virus at the Conservative Political Action Convention last month, is partly filling his time in isolation with interviews. In his talk with The Spectator, Gaetz described his feeling upon finding out while aboard Air Force One that he had posed for a picture with the ill man: “And that really concerned me because in the picture I was holding the guy’s phone. I might as well have licked his toilet seat.” We don’t know how they take pictures down in Pensacola, but it sounds pretty intense.- President Trump is a golfer, so this analogy may be apt: Oval Office speeches are like hitting a one iron on an approach shot. If you nail it, it’s highly effective and looks majestic. There’s nothing quite like it. But if you miss – and most of us miss – you just make a bad shot go farther. Trump was right to resist giving his Wednesday night address. We were reminded very much of then-President Obama’s first Oval Office address in June of 2010 about a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Obama muffed that shot for sure. It’s just a very challenging medium. Only the very, very best are able to pull it off. Others ought to lay up whenever possible.- Whatever you thought of Trump’s pained delivery, Noah Rothman observes that it was the factual errors that are the real problem: “Either the president misspoke, the prepared text of his national address was irredeemably sloppy, or the White House has not been coordinating closely with the health-insurance industry ahead of the address. Whatever the explanation, it isn’t acceptable.” It’s always unfortunate when leaders blame staff work, but what the heck is going on at the White House?- Can the government really restrict your freedom of movement during a quarantine without due process? While you’ve been out hoarding Charmin and getting your pets fitted for masks, Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano has been pondering the constitutional questions. The Judge explains how in the coronavirus response, the Constitution restricts mandatory government quarantines: “The issue of whether government in America can quarantine persons against their will, ostensibly for their own health and that of others with whom they may come in contact, requires a dual analysis – one of the powers of the federal government and the other of the powers of the states.” More here.- Shout out to 17-year-old Avi Schiffmann. The Seattle-area student at Bellevue College developed the website that has become a global sensation for people trying to track the spread of coronavirus. He began his project in December because there was so much misinformation and so few resources. He told the Mercer Island Reporter his thought when he was frustrated with what was available: “Well, I can do better than the government.”- One youth who could learn a lesson from Schiffman about good entrepreneurship is the student at Dixons Unity Academy in Leeds, England who was sent home after it was discovered that the teen was selling squirts of hand sanitizer for the equivalent of 64 cents a pop.  THE RULEBOOK: FROM THE BOTTOM UP“It has been shown in the course of these papers, that the existing Confederation is founded on principles which are fallacious; that we must consequently change this first foundation, and with it the superstructure resting upon it.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 37TIME OUT: THAT’S WHY THIS SNAIL IS A TRAMPNatGeo: “If you think Daylight Saving Time is the biggest drag on your morning alertness, you may want to consider coffee leaf rust. Coffee leaf rust is the most economically significant coffee pest in the world. Since the 1980s, occasional outbreaks of this fungus have crippled coffee production in the Americas, at times doubling or tripling its price. And the problem has escalated since 2008, as have the massive resources invested in fighting it. A new discovery raises an intriguing possibility for controlling coffee’s costliest pest, and it comes packed inside a small shell. According to recent research from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, Asian tramp snails, Bradybaena similaris, can consume large amounts of coffee rust before the disease can damage the plant. Leave one snail on a rust-covered leaf, and it can hoover up 30 percent of the fungus in 24 hours.”Flag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARDESTIMATED DELEGATES FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATIONBiden: 864Sanders: 710[Ed. note: 1,991 delegates needed to win]TRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE Average approval: 44.2 percentAverage disapproval: 52.6 percentNet Score: 8.4 percentChange from one week ago: ↓ 2.2 points[Average includes: Quinnipiac University: 41% approve - 54% disapprove; CNN: 45% approve - 52% disapprove; Fox News: 47% approve - 52% disapprove; IBD: 41% approve - 54% disapprove; Gallup: 47% approve - 51% disapprove.]WANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT? You can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

The move is intended to quell concerns raised in recent weeks by senior Democratic strategists about the leadership structure of the Biden campaign, which has been beset by underwhelming fundraising, scant staffing resources and organizational miscues during the early nominating contests. The campaign shuffle is an acknowledgment that while Biden has had a remarkable recent run of victories — at least 15 of the past 21 contests — his operation was not up to the challenge posed by President Trump if Biden wins the nomination. After Biden performed well below expectations in the Iowa caucuses, Anita Dunn, a senior adviser who previously worked for President Barack Obama, took operational control of the campaign, sharing responsibilities with Biden’s original campaign manager, Greg Schultz.”Biden campaign shares path-to-victory memo - Fox News: “An internal memo from the campaign of former Vice President Joe Biden said it's ‘nearing impossible’ for Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., to regain the lead in delegates after losses in several of the Democrats' presidential primary contests. The memo said the campaign netted 160 delegates, including up to 80 won on Tuesday. Biden campaign officials said they expected his lead to expand in ‘some of our strongest’ states -- Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Ohio and Georgia. ‘Of 682 delegates awarded in those states, conservative estimates have us winning more than 400 delegates and netting more than 150 delegates,’ the memo read. The officials said wins for Sanders in Vermont, Colorado and Utah haven't collected him enough delegates to be able to compete. ‘It's not just that Sanders has failed to win a large number of states, it's also that these wins have not netted significant delegates for him in the way they have for us,’ the memo read.”Dems continue to pressure Sanders out - Bloomberg: “Democrats are pressuring Bernie Sanders to drop out of the presidential race in order to unify the progressive and moderate wings of the party against their common foe: Donald Trump. After a series of wins on Tuesday extended Joe Biden’s delegate lead to an all-but-insurmountable level, Democratic leaders began publicly calling on Sanders to end his campaign, fearing a prolonged fight could splinter the party and give Trump another term in office. But Sanders and some allies are having none of it. He agreed on Wednesday that defeating Trump was the party’s ultimate goal, but said he remained convinced he was the candidate to do it. He insisted that voters supported his progressive agenda, even though they were choosing Biden for ‘electability’ reasons. ‘Today I say to the Democratic establishment, in order to win in the future, you need to win the voters who represent the future of our country and you must speak to the issues of concern to them,’ he told reporters.Bloomberg reports $275 million spent on anti-Trump ads - WSJ: “Michael Bloomberg’s presidential campaign spent $275 million just on advertising attacking President Trump, according the campaign. The former New York City mayor, who entirely self-funded his campaign before dropping out last week, invested about $225 million on 31 different anti-Trump TV ads, according to his team. Of that amount, more than $175 million was spent on local markets, including in general-election swing states, and $45 million on national buys.”AUDIBLE: CASHED OUT“The conventional wisdom about money’s role in American politics is overblown.

"                          Dr. William Schaffner, professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, joins ‘The Daily Briefing.’ President Tweeted out a series of charts on Thursday explaining safety precautions Americans can take to avoid becoming infected by the coronavirus. The charts, which include tips for home, work, school and other locations, advise people to wash their hands thoroughly, adjust any unnecessary travel or plans, and avoid going to work or school if you feel sick. The tweets come a day after Trump announced the suspension of travel between European countries and the United States for 30 days as the fast-spreading coronavirus pandemic continues to grow. The travel measure will go into effect at midnight Friday, Trump said during a nationally televised message from the White House on Wednesday. He said the ""strong but necessary"" restrictions would not apply to the United Kingdom. As the coronavirus continues to spread worldwide, the U.S. and many other nations have enacted tough measures to contain the illness, including barring foreign visitors from countries ravaged by the outbreak. ""I'm confident that by counting and continuing to take these tough measures we will significantly reduce the threat to our citizens and we'll ultimately and expeditiously defeat this virus,"" Trump said.  The Trump administration so far has barred travelers from mainland China, where the virus originated last December, and Iran, which also has seen a spike in infections, from entering the United States.  The restrictions covered any foreign nationals who visited those countries within the past 14 days. The virus has killed over 4,200 people and sickened nearly 120,000 others globally. Some 1,200 cases have been reported in the U.S. CLICK HERE FOR FOX NEWS' COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE In addition to travel restrictions, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned Americans to avoid all nonessential travel to multiple countries, including Italy, which largely has been in a lockdown state amid a surge in coronavirus infections. Other nations included South Korea, China and Iran. The agency also has warned Americans to take extra precautions when traveling to Japan. Fox News Louis Casiano contributed to this report.

"                          The coronavirs and its impact on the federal government from school closings to travel restrictions. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday gave a stark assessment of the coronavirus pandemic, calling it the “worst public health crisis for a generation” and telling British families that many are going to lose loved ones because of the virus. “This is the worst public crisis for a generation, some people compare it to seasonal flu, alas that is not right,"" he said. ""Owing to the lack of immunity, this disease is more dangerous and it’s going to spread further."" TRUMP SHRUGS OFF EU ANGER ABOUT CORONAVIRUS TRAVEL BAN: 'WHEN THEY RAISE TAXES ON US, THEY DON'T CONSULT US' ""I must level with the British public, many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time,” he added. Johnson addressed reporters after holding an emergency COBRA meeting of top Cabinet officials to discuss the growing global pandemic. The prime minister held off from certain measures that other European countries had taken, such as banning large public gatherings and shutting down schools, but said that the government was advising anyone with a fever or persistent cough to stay at home for a week. He said the government may soon recommend that entire households self-isolate, but that it was not issuing that advice at this time.

(Simon Dawson/Pool via AP) On closing schools, he said that the scientific advice was “this could do more harm than good at this time.” His remarks come hours after Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar announced that all schools, universities and other public facilities will be closed and teaching will be done online or remotely. IRELAND ANNOUNCES SWEEPING MEASURES TO COMBAT CORONAVIRUS, SCHOOLS TO CLOSE FOR TWO WEEKS “We have not witnessed a pandemic of this nature in living memory and this is uncharted territory for us,” Varadkar said from Washington, D.C. While Britain has so far been spared the kind of significant spread that other countries such as Italy have suffered, the country has 590 confirmed cases and at least 10 deaths. But Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, said the number of infected could rise to 10,000. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW Vallance also said that the government believes that the peak might be 10 to 14 weeks away. About 95 percent who will be infected could be struck over a nine to 10-week period on either side of that peak. The officials showed a graph showing the predicted peak, with a sharp increase and decline on either side of it. Johnson made reference to that graph when he urged Brits with symptoms to self-isolate, saying it would “help us delay and flatten the peak, squash that sombrero.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Britain was given a boost on Wednesday night when President Trump announced a European travel ban but excluded both the U.K. and Ireland from the restrictions. “The U.K. basically has got the border, strong borders and they're doing a very good, job, they don't have much infections and hopefully they'll keep it that way,” he said. Johnson is a close ally of Trump, who has in turn supported Johnson's push to take Britain out of the European Union. Fox News' Chris Irvine and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

"                          Coronavirus concerns lead DNC to change location of first head-to-head debate between Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden; Peter Doocy reports from Wilmington, Delaware. Election officials across the country are moving to make last-minute changes to how and where voters will cast their ballots in the remaining primary elections as the U.S. grapples with the widening coronavirus outbreak. The states voting in next Tuesday’s primary – Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio – are all taking extra precautions to protect both voters and poll workers from COVID-19, including moving polling locations, recruiting reserve poll workers and encouraging populations most at risk from the virus to vote early or send in an absentee ballot.  Maybe nowhere is taking the precautions more seriously than in Florida, where residents – including the state’s more than 4.3 million people over the age of 65, or about 20 percent of the state’s population – will head to the polls next Tuesday. The elderly and those with underlying health conditions are most at risk of developing serious complications if they contract the coronavirus. CLICK HERE FOR ALL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has stated that nursing homes are at the highest risk of being affected by the virus – given the age of residents and the close quarters in which people live – but nursing homes are also popular locations for polling sites.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called the use of nursing homes as polling sites “problematic” during a news conference on Wednesday and suggested that if a polling site is at one of these facilities, only residents should be able to vote there. In Pinellas County – home to Tampa Bay and St. Petersburg – election officials said they will be rerouting voters slated to cast a ballot at a nursing home to the next closest polling place.  Another issue facing election officials in the Sunshine State is a dearth of poll workers as fears grow of contracting the coronavirus.  During the last presidential election, 56 percent of poll workers in the country were 61 years old or older, according to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, and Florida officials say workers are dropping out in huge numbers.  In Florida’s Pasco County, supervisor of elections Brian Corley told the Tampa Bay Times that he is “hemorrhaging” workers, after 30 people dropped out due to fears of the coronavirus. Corley is now asking the county’s sheriff’s office for employees to fill the void and wants DeSantis to open large, centralized voting centers if they can’t wrangle up enough volunteers. MIAMI-DADE DECLARES STATE OF EMERGENCY AMID CORONAVIRUS, SUSPENDS ALL MAJOR EVENTS “You have to think of every possible scenario of what you can do and how you could pivot,” Corley said. On the opposite side of the state, elections officials in Palm Beach County last month recruited around 300 extra poll workers in preparation for concerns over the virus – a prudent move as 325 workers had canceled as of Tuesday. Nearby Broward County has more than 4,000 poll workers for 577 precincts at 421 locations, and officials there say they are confident they will have enough people manning the polls to pull off next Tuesday’s primary.  “We have recruited and have backups for far more poll workers than we need at this point in time,” Broward Supervisor of Elections Pete Antonacci told the Florida Sun-Sentinel. “To date we have not had any issues ensuring adequate staffing.” Both counties are also shifting polling sites away from nursing homes and beefing up supplies of hand sanitizer, wipes, soap, alcohol and paper towels at sites.  The other states voting next Tuesday are also taking precautions to prevent the further spread of the coronavirus at polling sites.  In Arizona – whose 1.2 million seniors make up over 17 percent of the state’s population – polling sites are being moved away from nursing homes to churches, libraries and American Legion headquarters. Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs also announced on Thursday that the state will allow curbside voting and is encouraging people to vote early. The state will also be thoroughly cleaning each polling site throughout the day.  WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION OFFICIAL: 80 PERCENT OF CORONAVIRUS CASES WILL INVOLVE MILD SYMPTOMS “We are encouraging these additional precautions for certain voting locations,” Hobbs said in a statement. “We also want to remind voters to make a plan for participating in this election.” The Democratic National Committee announced Thursday that it was moving Sunday's presidential debate from Arizona to Washington, D.C. because of concerns about coronavirus. The party had already announced that the debate between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders would be held without a live audience. Now the location is changing due to concerns about cross-country travel. In addition, Univision anchor Jorge Ramos no longer will moderate the debate because he was in proximity to a person who was in direct contact with another individual who tested positive for the virus. The DNC says Ramos is not symptomatic. Ohio elections officials are also shifting polling sites away from nursing homes and permitting curbside voting as well as encouraging any poll workers who feel ill to avoid coming in to work. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP ""While we certainly don’t want poll workers to participate if they aren’t feeling well, we are working with our county boards to ensure a healthy voting environment,"" Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose said in a press conference. In Illinois, elections officials in Chicago were mulling over a clause in the Illinois Constitution mandating that elections are “free and equal” amid arguments that the coronavirus outbreak prevented a “free and equal” election.  State law, however, does not explicitly allow for elections to be postponed and officials in the Windy City told the Chicago Sun-Times there is “no chance” the city will delay the election. Much like the other states voting on Tuesday, Illinois is also moving polling locations away from nursing homes and advising people to mail in ballots whenever possible.

This comes as Republicans are opposing House Democrats' proposed legislation, which McConnell had described as an ""ideological wish list.""

A senior Senate Republican aide said that senators will be departing for the weekend but will be back to address the House bill Monday, despite originally scheduled to have next week off. ""We’ll take a look at anything they send us,"" McConnell said. The Democrats' bill, unveiled late Wednesday, provides for paid sick leave, free coronavirus testing and funding for states to address economic hardships imposed by the coronavirus. McCarthy had opposed it due to the lack of exemptions or sunsets for the paid sick leave, as well as the time it would take to set up the sick leave program. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she and her fellow Democrats are open to making changes to their bill and are still discussing the issues with the Trump administration.

"                          The National Coalition for Men is challenging the Selective Service System in court, arguing that women should be part of the draft. As America gears up for possible military confrontations in the Middle East and South China Sea, the Trump Administration is considering doing away with the country's all-male draft system.   Back in 1981, the Supreme Court ruled the male-only draft is constitutional, and it's been in place ever since. Every year, millions of American men turn 18 and fill out their Selective Service card; it's become something of a rite of passage.  But women are playing a greater role in today's military, including serving in combat units since 2015. Now the National Coalition for Men is challenging the Selective Service System in court, arguing that the previous ruling is out of date and discriminatory, and women should be part of the draft. The move comes as the Trump Administration has been looking for new ways to get Americans excited about careers in the military, but in a booming economy, it hasn't been easy. Army Secretary Ryan Mccarthy recently told Fox's Bret Baier that ""recruiting's been a challenge. Three-point-six percent unemployment, so, there are no benchmarks. We're kind of in uncharted territory."" Arguing for the government, the Justice Department is opposing any changes to Selective Service at this time, saying only Congress has the power to regulate the draft, not the courts. They also say this isn't the right time to shake up a system that's been in place for decades. But that argument might be changing soon. The White House has convened a Federal Commission to look into the issue to see if it's appropriate to include women in a future draft situation. They haven't released their report yet, but people we spoke to were overwhelmingly in favor of including women in the draft.  Most called it an issue of equality.   Still, there were others who said women should be allowed to volunteer for the military, but not be subject to the draft. It's a debate that will likely continue until the Commission releases its final recommendations at the end of March.      ",         Trump administration considering doing away with America's male-only draft system,         2020-03-12T134927-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/trump-administration-considering-doing-away-with-americas-male-only-draft-system,Fox
"                          Fox News contributor Lawrence Jones says forcing Sen. Bernie Sanders out of the primary race would deprive Joe Biden of one-on-one debate experience and alienate the senator's supporters. The Democratic National Committee has moved Sunday’s planned Democratic presidential debate from Phoenix, Ariz., to a studio in Washington, D.C., where former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders will debate without a live audience, amid coronavirus fears. “Out of an abundance of caution and in order to reduce cross-country travel, all parties have decided that the best path forward is to hold Sunday’s debate at CNN’s studio in Washington, D.C., with no live audience,” DNC Communications Director Xochitl Hinojosa said in a statement Thursday. She also announced that moderator Jorge Ramos will step back from this debate due to contact with someone who was in contact with someone else who tested positive. NO LIVE AUDIENCE AT NEXT DEM DEBATE AMID CORONAVIRUS  “In addition, the DNC, CNN and Univision recently learned that Univision anchor and moderator Jorge Ramos was in proximity with someone who was in direct contact with a person that tested positive for coronavirus,” she continued. “Both Mr. Ramos and the person he was in contact with are in good health and symptom-free. Despite being cleared by medical professionals and out of an abundance of caution, Jorge has decided to step aside from participating in the upcoming March 15 democratic debate. Univision’s News Anchor Ilia Calderón will moderate the debate in his place.” She added: “Our number one priority has and will continue to be the safety of our staff, campaigns and all those involved in the debate.” The DNC on Wednesday had announced that the debate would take place, as scheduled, in Arizona, but without a live audience “at the request of both campaigns and out of an abundance of caution.” The decision to move the event to D.C. comes a day after the World Health Organization designated the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, an international pandemic. President Trump on Wednesday night, in an address to the nation from the Oval Office, said he was calling for a temporary halt on air travel to the United States from Europe, excluding flights from the United Kingdom and those carrying cargo, in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. ""The virus will not have a chance against us. No nation is more prepared, or more resilient,"" Trump said. The outbreak is believed to have originated at an animal and seafood market in the city of Wuhan, China. As of Thursday morning, there were more than 1,300 cases of coronavirus in the United States, in 44 states, including Washington, D.C. The U.S. has, so far, seen 36 coronavirus-related deaths. US CAPITOL CLOSED TO GENERAL PUBLIC AMID CORONAVIRUS CONCERNS For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus.

"                          An inside look into President Trump’s immigration tent court system. The Trump administration established the ""Remain in Mexico"" policy in January 2019 -- a policy that has become one of the central pieces of the administration’s push to combat the ongoing crisis at the southern border. The policy, formally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, involves migrants who arrive at the southern border and claim asylum. They are returned to Mexico to await their hearings instead of being allowed into the United States. INSIDE TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION TENT COURTS: CONTROVERSIAL SYSTEM MEANT TO FAST-TRACK ASYLUM BACKLOG  The policy has seen tent courtrooms set up in places such as Laredo and Brownsville, Texas, where migrants could have their cases processed as the policy was expanded in the summer amid greater cooperation with Mexico. By doing so, administration officials say it has helped end the practice of “catch-and-release” and also helped end a pull factor that was drawing migrants north. Officials say it dramatically reduces processing times as well, getting cases through in a matter of months rather than years. “The importance of MPP can’t be stated enough. It is what’s allowed us to take control of the crisis that we saw in April and May. The idea is to make sure we process individuals in a timely manner but make sure they wait south of the border,” Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf said. SUPREME COURT GIVES TRUMP WIN BY ALLOWING 'REMAIN IN MEXICO' POLICY TO CONTINUE But opponents say that it sends migrants into dangerous areas in Mexico, where they are at risk of violence and kidnapping. Top Democratic presidential candidates have promised to end the policy if elected into office. The group Human Rights First has called the courts ""secretive"" and described them as part of an ""attack"" on due process within a ""sham"" asylum system. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals recently blocked the policy, but suspended its ruling until the Supreme Court could weigh in. The 9th Circuit panel accepted the claim that ""non-Mexicans returned to Mexico under the MPP risk substantial harm, even death, while they await adjudication of their applications for asylum."" The Supreme Court handed the administration a significant victory when it said it would allow the administration to enforce the policy as litigation continues. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The expansion of MPP has coincided with dramatic results at the border – including a more than 70 percent decrease in apprehensions since the highs of May last year. It has been combined with a series of regional agreements on migration with countries south of the border. Approximately 60,000 people have been returned to Mexico since the policy was introduced. DHS estimates suggest a significant number of those eventually gave up their cases and returned home.

"                          Former Vice President Joe Biden swept to victory in Michigan's pivotal primary contest Tuesday, capturing four more states; Biden deputy campaign manager and communications director Kate Bedingfield discusses Biden's biggest challenge as campaign rolls on. I’ll be brief. In the spirit of Joe Biden now giving seven-minute speeches—the better to limit possible gaffes—I will be as terse as possible in assessing the Democratic race. I won’t say it’s over. The reason is that too many people in my profession declared Biden a dead man walking in what now looks like a spectacular failure of judgment. And the entire media and political establishment said there was no flippin’ way that Donald Trump was going to beat Hillary Clinton. But do I see much daylight for a possible Bernie comeback? As hard as I might squint, it’s very difficult. JOURNALISTS FEAR CONTRACTING VIRUS AS COVERAGE INCREASINGLY CRITICIZED When Biden routed Sanders in Michigan, where the democratic socialist had made a last stand of sorts, it was clear he was headed for another big night of Super Tuesday proportions. He clobbered Sanders in Missouri and Mississippi. He even won Idaho. And while Biden lost North Dakota, the fact that he’s trailing by a fraction of a percent in Washington state is a remarkable comeback by itself. And Biden replicated his stunning coalition of blacks, working-class whites, women, suburbanites and older voters, losing only younger people excited by Bernie’s sweeping and costly agenda. So when Sanders called in the media yesterday afternoon, there was understandable speculation that he might be dropping out. He admitted that he is losing the delegate race as well as the electability argument, but said he’d fight on, starting with Sunday’s CNN debate. And he took no questions. The problem for Bernie is that he’s fighting on unfavorable turf—he’ll most likely get pounded next week in Florida and Georgia—which makes it even more difficult to close the gap in delegates. The Washington Post headline on Dan Balz’s analysis: “Biden Appears to be on an unstoppable march to the nomination.” The always measured Balz writes that “barring something unforeseen, Democrats now know that former vice president Joe Biden will be the party’s nominee to challenge President Trump in November…there is little to give Sanders any confidence that he can reverse the trends enough to overtake the surging Biden.” SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES Politico is even more definitive: “In every way other than mathematically, his presidential campaign is done.” The piece says that for the first time the Sanders camp has no excuse, since Elizabeth Warren dropped out and he got the two-man contest he’s long wanted. The New York Times says this of Biden’s “dominant position”: “So thorough is Mr. Biden’s hold on the party now that any collapse would probably require a political U-turn as sharp as the one that precipitated his rise.” And the Atlantic headline on Ron Brownstein’s piece simply says, “It’s Over.” I did get the impression from Bernie’s tone yesterday that he’s playing out the string. As a veteran politician, he must know he faces Mission Impossible and is trying to extend his time in the spotlight to argue for his ideas. And Biden faces his own set of pressures, to win over Bernie supporters for the fall campaign. One last point—I know, I’m almost done—comes from Times conservative columnist Ross Douthat. He says the coronavirus boosted Joe, that with this burgeoning crisis there is “a flight to safety, the surrender of grand plans and big ambitions in favor of a desire to just survive. Michigan voted for Biden overwhelmingly for the same reason that both Biden and Sanders canceled rallies just before the vote — because this is now the coronavirus election, against whose stark existential stakes all normal political battles must give way.” I think there’s something to that. A crisis like what the WHO now calls a pandemic leads people to want to play it safe, and whether the criticism of President Trump is warranted or not, they find a former vice president more reassuring than a maverick preaching revolution. Okay, I’m done. Thank you all for coming.

"                          President Trump and White House officials are discussing how to stimulate the economy after stocks make a record one-day drop; John Roberts reports. It was inevitable that the media, which have been covering the coronavirus round the clock, would soon be affected by the virus as well. The Washington Post has asked reporters who covered CPAC to self-quarantine for seven days, since someone at the conservative conference was infected with the virus. Politico and the Daily Beast have asked its reporters who covered the gathering in suburban Maryland to work remotely, according to Washingtonian. (Several members of Congress are self-quarantining after attending CPAC, and that includes Mark Meadows, President Trump’s incoming chief of staff.) Katie Couric tweeted that she had been with Rick Cotton, head of the New York and New Jersey Port Authority, over the weekend, and wished him well after he had contracted the virus. Many people demanded to know why she hadn’t immediately self-quarantined. Couric said she’d only had a 90-second conversation with no physical contact, and her doctor and health officials said there was no need for a quarantine, but that she would be cautious and work from home. MEDIA LAUNCH VEEPSTAKES CHATTER: BIDEN NEEDS A WOMAN, BUT WHICH ONE? This is probably just the beginning. If members of Congress are at risk, Capitol Hill reporters might also be exposed to the virus. And many outside guests pass through television studios, and are touched by makeup artists. In one sign of the times, the press seats in the Pentagon briefing room have been spread out in a bow to social distancing. On the entertainment side of the business, TMZ reports that “Jeopardy!” and “Wheel of Fortune” have decided to tape their shows without a live studio audience. One reported concern is the weakened immune system of “Jeopardy!” host Alex Trebek, who is battling Stage 4 cancer. It’s hard to be in journalism without personal contact with people–whether it’s covering rallies or debates, flying on Air Force One, or getting out and interviewing people--but we all need to rethink our daily routines. And what about the party conventions in July and August? Will they come off as planned if the virus is spreading at anything like the rate it is today? Will many of the 15,000 journalists who generally attend decide to pass up Milwaukee and Charlotte? There are more subtle effects as well. It’s one thing to be reporting and writing about coronavirus in China, Italy, or the Seattle suburbs. It’s another thing when people you actually know are contracting the virus, and adds to the sense that the disease is dangerously spreading. And this comes at a time when the news business is under fire—by critics ranging from Trump to Dr. Drew—for unnecessarily scaring people about the magnitude of the threat. (The press, in turn, regularly lambastes Trump for underplaying the situation.) Some bomb-throwers like CNBC commentator Rick Santelli aren’t helping. He called for everyone in America to be infected with the virus to get it over with. “It was just a stupid thing to say,” he later admitted on “Squawk Box.” “The idea of something so absurd — I just apologize, and I apologize to everyone on this segment and all my peers at CNBC. We will get through this. We are resilient. But even if one life is affected, I do apologize for my insensitivity.”  SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham is demanding that Vanity Fair retract a report that Trump has told aides he’s afraid that journalists will try to contract the coronavirus and give it to him on Air Force One. “False and sensational writing on this topic is irresponsible,” she said. The broader dilemma, in my view, is not so much the tone of the coverage as the relentless volume of it. There are so many angles to this global story, including the stock market plunge that culminated Monday with the largest drop since the 2008 financial crisis. Harvard kicks students out of the dorms and moves to online classes. Boston cancels its St. Patrick’s Day parade. South by Southwest is canceled. Pearl Jam cancels its concerts. Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders camce; rallies in Cleveland. New York and Florida declare states of emergency. Andrew Cuomo deploys the National Guard to a “containment zone” in a New York City suburb. There is talk of the NCAA tournament, and even the NBA, playing without fans (which LeBron James says he would boycott). And every new case, or handful of cases, gets breaking-news treatment. These and many other stories are significant and have to be covered. What’s more, there is clearly a huge public appetite for news about the virus (not to mention a thriving market of disinformation on social media, as the NYT reports). That’s why the subject is dominating cable news and the top of home pages of major newspapers. In that sense, news executives can be described as giving the public what it wants. But with America on edge, with emotions so raw, with the crisis so politicized, journalists need to think long and hard about whether their they are even inadvertently sowing the seeds of panic.

As she told Democratic members that the House of Representatives was close to a ""bipartisan agreement"" on a second bill to fight the coronavirus pandemic, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., also telegraphed overnight that the chamber would begin work on a third coronavirus-related spending measure. The move came after the worst day on the stock market since 1987, with stocks plunging 10 percent and after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell canceled his chamber's recess scheduled for next week. Pelosi has not indicated whether the House of Representatives will do the same. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ""Time is of the essence, and this bill must be passed and sent to the Senate,"" a Thursday night Dear Colleague letter from Pelosi to House Democrats read. ""The House will then get to work on a third emergency response package that will take further effective action that protects the health, economic security and well-being of the American people."" HOUSE BILL THAT WOULD PROVIDE CORONAVIRUS SICK LEAVE, FREE TESTS IN FLUX Friday morning, major futures indexes showed gains of 3.5 percent, potentially on hopes of a second piece of legislation dedicated to fighting the novel coronavirus and shielding the economy from its effects. That increase indicates that investors may be calming down for now after an anxiety-filled week that culminated in Thursday's rapid-fire headlines of closures, cancellations and shutdowns of schools, sporting events, government agencies and even Disneyland. It's unclear what would be in a third coronavirus bill from the House, though there was significant disagreement between Republicans and Democrats over the details of the second one. Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin negotiated throughout Thursday to tweak the second coronavirus bill and reach a compromise the president could sign. Pelosi expressed a sense of urgency to pass legislation to help families in need with the scheduled recess looming. McConnell slammed Pelosi's initial proposal as an ""ideological wish list."" Trump had wanted a payroll tax cut that Pelosi didn't include. Republicans also raised concerns about the expansiveness of new paid sick leave programs and not including language to ban federal funds for abortion.

"                          Rep. Michael C. Burgess, who is also a physician, says Congress needs to work together now more than ever. A Democratic congresswoman secured a commitment for free coronavirus testing from the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday after she peppered him with questions about the importance of testing and the cost of treatment. ‘""Dr. Kadlec, for someone without insurance, do you know the out-of-pocket cost of a complete blood count test?"" Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif., first asked Robert Kadlec, assistant secretary of Health and Human Services, at the House Oversight Committee hearing on coronavirus preparedness. PELOSI TELEGRAPHS THIRD CORONAVIRUS FUNDING BILL AMID SCRAMBLE TO CALM MARKETS Kadlec said he did not immediately know. Porter then went through, step-by-step, how much she estimated various tests and an emergency room visit would cost for an uninsured American -- pulling out a whiteboard as she did her math. “This is like ‘The Price is Right,’” she commented as she went through the costs. She eventually came to the figure of $1,331 and said it could be another $4,000 if that included a period of isolation in a hospital. ""Fear of these costs are going to keep people from being tested, from getting the care they need and from keeping their communities safe,"" Porter said. ""We live in a world where 40 percent of Americans can't even afford a $400 unexpected expense."" She then turned to Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the CDC, and asked if he wants to know who has the coronavirus: ""Not just rich people, but everybody who might have the virus?"" When Redfield said he did, she cited a statute she said allows the CDC director to authorize payment for treatment for certain people subject to quarantine and isolation and asked if he would commit to use that authority to pay for testing for every American, regardless of insurance. ""Well, I can say that we're going to do everything to make sure everybody can get the care they need,” Redfield started, before being cut off by Porter, who said his answer was “not good enough.”       Rep. Katie Porter speaks at a House Oversight Committee hearing on the coronavirus.       She continued to grill Redfield as he said CDC was working with HHS to “see how we operationalize” getting testing for all Americans and asked him to commit to free testing. HOUSE BILL THAT WOULD PROVIDE CORONAVIRUS SICK LEAVE, FREE TESTS IN FLUX “Doctor Redfield you don’t need to do any work to operationalize, you need to make a commitment to the American people so they come in to get tested,” Porter shot back. ""You can operationalize the payment structure tomorrow."" ""I think you're an excellent questioner, so my answer is yes,"" Redfield said eventually. ""Excellent. Everybody in America hear that, you are eligible to go get tested for coronavirus and have that covered, regardless of insurance,"" Porter said.

"                          GOP senators ramp up Biden investigation; Homeland Security Committee chair Sen. Ron Johnson weighs in. Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson plans to subpoena a consulting firm linked to Hunter Biden and the Ukrainian energy company he worked with for records to review potential conflicts of interest -- and whether individuals at the firm improperly used the relationship with the former vice president’s son to “influence” U.S. government agencies. Johnson had initially notified the committee’s Democratic Ranking Member Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan last month that he planned to subpoena a former consultant with the firm Blue Star Strategies. But he decided, after bipartisan meetings and briefings, to instead subpoena the firm directly for documents and records, and request interviews with the firm’s founders to discuss their work on behalf of one of their clients—Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden sat on the board. GOP SENATORS SEEK RECORDS ON 'CONNECTION' BETWEEN DEM OPERATIVES, UKRAINIAN OFFICIALS IN 2016 “This subpoena is in furtherance of the Committee’s ongoing work to address the many unanswered questions about potential conflicts of interest and the extent to which representatives of Burisma—including officials at Blue Star—used individuals with close personal connections to high-level officials within the Obama administration to gain access to and potentially influence U.S. government agencies,” Johnson wrote Thursday. The move could revive some of the same issues that President Trump sought to investigate last year, before his intervention prompted his own impeachment. Johnson plans to subpoena Blue Star for records dating back to January 1, 2013, regarding their work for Burisma Holdings, or individuals associated with Burisma’s founder, Mykola Zlochevsky. He also wants Blue Star CEO Karen Tramontano and Chief Operating Officer Sally Painter for depositions. According to State Department records obtained by the Daily Caller, Painter and Tramontano both had contact in 2016 with the agency regarding Burisma. During communications with the State Department, Painter mentioned Biden was affiliated with the company. The State Department under the Obama administration considered Burisma to be a corrupt company, a view that Blue Star was attempting to change. Johnson initially planned to subpoena a consultant from Blue Star, but said he was “bound by a non-disclosure agreement” and noted that Blue Star’s past responses to the committee were incomplete. Johnson said that, among other issues, Blue Star did not completely disclose its employees and contractors who worked on the Burisma matter. Johnson acknowledged Peters’ “disapproval” of the initial plan to subpoena just the consultant. “Your letter stated your concern ‘that the United States Senate and this Committee could be used to further disinformation efforts by Russian or other actors,’ and asked that the Committee receive defensive briefings ‘specifically regarding [the Blue Star consultant],” Johnson wrote. BIDEN-BURISMA PROBE WILL GET TO THE TRUTH, JOHNSON SAYS  “Over the last several weeks we have had a number of bipartisan meetings and briefings to discuss the subpoena and address the concerns of Committee members,” he continued. “During the course of these discussions, the suggestion was made by both Democrat and Republican members of our Committee that we should issue a subpoena directly to the source of the documents relevant to our work: Blue Star.” Johnson added that he believes the “appropriate course of action at this time is to accommodate that request.” Biden joined Burisma in April 2014 and, at the time, reportedly connected the firm with Blue Star to help the Ukrainian natural gas firm fight corruption charges. At the time of Biden’s work on the board, then-Vice President Joe Biden was running U.S.-Ukraine relations and policy for the Obama administration. Biden’s work for Burisma received heightened scrutiny amid Trump’s impeachment last year. Trump, during his now-infamous July 25, 2019 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, pressed for Kiev to look into the elder Biden's role pressing for the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had been investigating the founder of Burisma. Allies of the now-front-running Democratic presidential primary candidate maintain that his intervention at the time had nothing to do with his son, but rather was tied to corruption concerns. According to reports, by the time of Biden's intervention, the Burisma probe had been dormant. Trump's pressure campaign against Ukraine prompted a whistleblower complaint, and, in turn, the impeachment inquiry. The president’s request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats cited as a quid pro quo arrangement. Trump was acquitted on both articles of impeachment—abuse of power and obstruction of Congress—in February. Meanwhile, Johnson’s subpoena request comes amid a joint investigation led by Johnson and GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Johnson, Graham and Grassley requested information in December related to potential conflicts of interest and political influence by Ukraine, including Burisma Holdings.

"                          Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden says the coronavirus pandemic does not have a political affiliation, requires a national response. As the number of coronavirus cases in the United States rose to at least 1,600 on Friday morning, both major Democratic presidential candidates have taken President Trump to task over his administration's response to the outbreak, while rolling out plans of their own on how they would fight the virus. Former Vice President Joe Biden criticized Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic Thursday as a ""colossal"" failure and released his own plan to deal with the crisis. Here is how Biden would fight the disease officially known as COVID-19. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW TRUMP TURNS FIRE ON OBAMA-BIDEN SWINE FLU RESPONSE, DEFENDS CORONAVIRUS HANDLING Urgency Biden released his lengthy plan to combat the coronavirus online. It emphasizes that the government, ""must spend whatever it takes, without delay, to meet public health needs and deal with the mounting economic consequences."" Testing One of the top reasons the Trump administration has been criticized over its response to the coronavirus is the delays in processing test results and the number of tests available. Biden calls for making ""testing widely available and free."" CRUZ EXTENDS SELF-QUARANTINE AFTER LEARNING OF INTERACTION WITH ANOTHER CORONAVIRUS PATIENT He would set up ""at least ten"" testing locations per state, including mobile units and drive-through locations. Biden would also task a CDC program with offering tests to people who may be exposed or at risk for COVID-19 but not know they should be tested. Equipment and personnel  Biden's plan would ready the equipment in the United States' Strategic National Stockpile to be sent to areas with concentrated coronavirus outbreaks. He would also have the Department of Defense (DOD) prepare its resources to assist in responding to highly affected areas, ""activating the Medical Reserve Corps, which consists of nearly 200,000 volunteer health care professionals who stand ready to serve across America."" Biden would also take other measures to ensure hospitals are equipped, supply chains are functioning and out-of-the-way facilities, including clinics and rural hospitals, are ready to deal with an increase in coronavirus cases. Costs  Biden's coronavirus plan would ensure ""that every person, whether insured or uninsured, will not have to pay a dollar out-of-pocket for visits related to COVID-19 testing, treatment, preventative services, and any eventual vaccine."" IS CORONAVIRUS A THREAT TO CHILDREN? HOW TO KEEP THEM SAFE In an effort to make certain everyone has coverage that will take care of the cost of coronavirus treatment, Biden would provide financial incentives to states so that everyone who is eligible for Medicaid is enrolled, among other measures. Economic relief Biden would amend the federal law pertaining to worker's compensation to give employees the benefit of the doubt if they are exposed to the coronavirus through work and have to miss time. He would also require paid leave be available for a variety of reasons at 100 percent of workers' salaries up to $72,800 per year. This would also apply to domestic workers, gig workers and others who don't fit the traditional definition of an employee who would be eligible for paid leave. Biden would also reimburse employers to help with paid leave, expand unemployment eligibility for those who are laid off, expand federal food programs, establish a program to loan money to small and medium businesses and more. Worldwide CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The plan on Biden's website calls for a ""Global Health Emergency Board"" to ""convene leadership of the United States, our G7 partners, and other countries in support of the World Health Organization (WHO) to ensure a coordinated health and economic response globally, especially with respect to vulnerable countries."" Additionally, Biden would mobilize resources to protect American diplomats and troops abroad while also working with other countries to prepare for future pandemics. ""The Biden Administration will build the global coalition necessary to fill urgent global gaps in pandemic preparedness, enhance accountability for those investments, and produce measurable results,"" the plan says.

"                          President Trump says he's not concerned after an aide to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro tested positive for the coronavirus after they dined together at an event. President Trump announced that he plans to hold a press conference Friday afternoon to address the coronavirus crisis, as concerns over the spreading outbreak wreak havoc on the economy and American life. ""I will be having a news conference today at 3:00 P.M., The White House. Topic: CoronaVirus!"" he tweeted. The announcement also comes amid conflicting reports over whether another person who came in contact with Trump in recent days -- Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro -- tested positive. Bolsonaro’s son Eduardo initially told Fox News that they were doing further testing to confirm the diagnosis. But minutes later, he told Fox News' ""America's Newsroom"" that the test came back negative. ""Everything’s good now,"" he said. Bolsonaro had been tested after one of his deputies, who also attended the meetings at Mar-a-Lago, tested positive for COVID-19. This comes days after they met with the president and vice president at Mar-a-Lago. BRAZIL'S PRESIDENT BOLSONARO TESTS POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS Amid these reports, a number of White House officials were called into an urgent meeting in the chief of staff’s office, Fox News was told Friday morning. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., also announced on Thursday that he was in self-quarantine after attending the meeting with Trump and Bolsonaro’s team at Mar-a-Lago. The president, at this point, has not been tested for coronavirus, even after having met with individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19 or interacted with others who have. Earlier this week, several Republican lawmakers went into self-quarantine, after an attendee of the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 26 to Feb. 29 notified CPAC organizers that he had tested positive. TRUMP DOUBLES DOWN ON CALL FOR PAYROLL TAX CUT AMID COVID-19 Both Trump and Vice President Pence, who has been appointed to lead the official Coronavirus Task Force, attended and spoke at CPAC.

Doug Collins on a trip last Friday to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, and Rep. Matt Gatez traveled on Air Force One on Monday. Both are in self-quarantine. Meanwhile, the president tweeted Friday morning touting ""strong border policy,"" saying that if U.S. borders were weak, more American coronavirus-related deaths would have been recorded at this point. “To this point, and because we have had a very strong border policy, we have had 40 deaths related to CoronaVirus. If we had weak or open borders, that number would be many times higher!” Trump tweeted Friday. The president, on Wednesday night after the World Health Organization designated COVID-19 a global pandemic, announced a temporary halt on air travel to the United States from Europe, excluding flights from the United Kingdom and those carrying cargo, in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. The outbreak is believed to have originated at an animal and seafood market in the city of Wuhan, China.

CPAC ATTENDEE WITH CORONAVIRUS HAD CONTACT WITH ‘SEVERAL’ MEMBERS OF CONGRESS: PHYSICIAN Cruz had been under self-quarantine, like several other Republican lawmakers, after attending the CPAC conference two weeks ago, where one person who attended was later revealed to have been infected. Before Cruz's quarantine, the senator also met on March 3 in his Washington D.C. office with Santiago Abascal, the leader of the Vox Party in Spain, who announced Thursday he tested positive for the virus. ""We met for about 20 minutes, sitting together at a conference table. We shook hands twice and took pictures together,"" Cruz said, noting that the Spanish politician was asymptomatic at the time. Cruz said he'll extend his self-quarantine until March 17. “I’m still not feeling any symptoms. I’m consulting with medical officials. But, for the same reasons I initially self-quarantined—out of an abundance of caution and to give everyone peace of mind—I am extending the self-quarantine to March 17, a full fourteen days from my meeting with Mr. Abascal,"" Cruz said. BRAZIL'S PRESIDENT BOLSONARO TESTS POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS No lawmakers have tested positive for coronavirus. But several politicians have been in self-isolation after coming into contact with someone who was infected. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., announced earlier this week they would self-isolate because they were at Mar-a-Lago over the weekend with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and his press secretary Fabio Wajngarten, who both tested positive for the virus after meeting with President Trump and others.

"                          Trump makes no apology for unilaterally banning travel from Europe in face of coronavirus pandemic; chief White House correspondent John Roberts reports. President Trump on Friday doubled down on calls for a payroll tax cut through the end of the year, arguing the move could be “really meaningful” and help to stabilize the economy amid the coronavirus outbreak. “If you want to get money into the hands of people quickly & efficiently, let them have the full money that they earned, APPROVE A PAYROLL TAX CUT until the end of the year, December 31. Then you are doing something that is really meaningful. Only that will make a big difference!” Trump tweeted Friday morning. Trump first floated the idea of temporarily nixing the payroll tax earlier this week. The president proposed slashing the tax for both employers and employees from 14.4 percent to zero. He also mentioned moves to aid small businesses and help hourly workers who might become sick. Sources even told Fox News that Trump would like to eventually make the payroll tax cut permanent and fund Social Security, Medicare and unemployment insurance from general revenues — moves that could further swell the deficit. Democrats have pushed back on these calls as lawmakers craft new legislation. TRUMP FLOATS TEMPORARILY ELIMINATING PAYROLL TAX Meanwhile, the president also called for the Federal Reserve to lower rates, and blasted Chairman Jerome Powell along the way. “The Federal Reserve must FINALLY lower the Fed Rate to something comparable to their competitor Central Banks. Jay Powell and group are putting us at a decided economic & physiological disadvantage. Should never have been this way. Also, STIMULATE!” Trump tweeted. The World Health Organization designated the outbreak a global pandemic on Wednesday. That night, during an Oval Office address to the nation, President Trump announced a temporary halt on air travel to the United States from Europe, excluding flights from the United Kingdom and those carrying cargo, in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. “The virus will not have a chance against us,” Trump said Wednesday. “No nation is more prepared, or more resilient.” The president appointed Vice President Pence to lead the Coronavirus Task Force, which has been providing daily press briefings and sharing information on the Trump administration’s new measures to combat the spread of COVID-19 across the nation. On Tuesday, Pence announced that insurance companies agreed to waive all co-pays on coronavirus testing and treatment amid the threat. Pence also announced that more than 4 million tests would be disbursed across the country by the end of the week. Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Seema Varna also announced Tuesday that the administration has removed “prior authorization requirements” for Medicare and Medicaid recipients and would “waive prescription refill limits and expand more access.” TRUMP: 'CORONAVIRUS DOES NOT CARE WHAT PARTY YOU ARE IN' The outbreak is believed to have originated at an animal and seafood market in the city of Wuhan, China. As of Friday morning, there were more than 1,600 cases of coronavirus in the United States, in 47 states, including Washington, D.C. The U.S. has, so far, seen 41 coronavirus-related deaths. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the WHO, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders compared how the U.S. should be responding to the pandemic, as declared this week by the World Health Organization, to the ""scale of a major war."" He laid out his vision for how the government should fight the coronavirus in a speech Thursday. Here is how Sanders would fight the disease officially known as COVID-19. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW DEMOCRACY 2020 DIGEST: SANDERS CITES CORONAVIRUS TO RENEW 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' PUSH Urgency Sanders warned Thursday that ""the number of casualties"" from the coronavirus ""may actually be even higher than what the armed forces experienced in World War II."" He said that he would declare a national emergency if he were president and called on Trump to do the same. Testing Sanders lamented that the U.S. medical system does not currently have the means to deal with a worst-case scenario coronavirus outbreak. He said that the government should ""respond aggressively to make certain that we, in fact, have the latest and most effective tests available and the quickest means of processing those tests.""

""None of the medical experts that I have talked to dispute that there is a major shortage of ICU units and ventilators that are needed to respond to this crisis,"" Sanders said. He called on the government to ""aggressively"" work with private businesses to ensure hospitals have that equipment. Additionally, Sanders asked, ""medical residents, retired medical professionals and other medical personnel to help us deal with this crisis."" Costs ""The pharmaceutical industry must be told in no uncertain terms that the medicines that they manufacture for this crisis will be sold at cost,"" Sanders said Thursday. He said he would not tolerate ""price gouging or profiteering."" Economic relief Sanders called for help for those who lose their jobs or can't work because of the coronavirus, ""instead of providing more tax breaks to the top one percent and large corporations."" The Vermont senator recommended 100 percent salary compensation capped at $60,000 per year for those who lose their jobs, as well as help for tipped workers at restaurants and other establishments that are seeing fewer customers as people stay home to avoid spreading the disease. TRUMP TURNS FIRE ON OBAMA-BIDEN SWINE FLU RESPONSE, DEFENDS CORONAVIRUS HANDLING Sanders would also have school lunches delivered to students' homes, put a moratorium on evictions and foreclosures, build emergency homeless shelters and ban utilities from shutting off services to people who miss their bills. The democratic socialist senator also said he would give emergency loans to small and medium businesses. 'Medicare-for-all' He also cited the outbreak to renew his call for his signature policy. Sanders said that if the U.S. had already implemented his ""Medicare-for-all"" proposal, it would be in better shape to fight the coronavirus pandemic because people would not be as reluctant to seek treatment.

CHINA HINTS AT DENYING AMERICANS LIFE-SAVING CORONAVIRUS DRUGS ""I think what the vice president meant to say was the same thing that again many members have said in the last few days,"" Gibbs said in a press briefing, vaguely defending Biden after a question from a reporter about accusations that the former vice president came ""close to fearmongering"" in televised comments. ""I understand what he said, I'm telling you what he meant to say,"" Gibbs continued to laughter from the press corps after he was pushed further. ""Obviously, if anybody was unduly alarmed for whatever reason we would apologize for that and I hope that my remarks and remarks of people at the CDC and [Obama Homeland Security] Secretary [Janet] Napolitano have appropriately cleared up what he meant to say."" INSIDE CHINA'S HIGH-STAKES CAMPAIGN TO SMEAR THE UNITED STATES OVER CORONAVIRUS The president also blamed red tape at the CDC and the Obama administration for complicating what his administration has been able to do in response to the novel coronavirus. ""For decades the @CDCgov looked at, and studied, its testing system, but did nothing about it. It would always be inadequate and slow for a large scale pandemic, but a pandemic would never happen, they hoped. President Obama made changes that only complicated things further,"" Trump tweeted. ""Their response to H1N1 Swine Flu was a full scale disaster, with thousands dying, and nothing meaningful done to fix the testing problem, until now. The changes have been made and testing will soon happen on a very large scale basis. All Red Tape has been cut, ready to go!"" CORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE=BY-STATE BREAKDOWN Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, admitted in testimony on Thursday that the ability of Americans to get tested for coronavirus is not up to the standard of other countries, adding the U.S. should be better equipped. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., asked about people’s ability to get tested while pointing out that even health care workers have been denied access to testing. “The system is not really geared to what we need right now — what you’re asking for,” Fauci said. “That is a failing.” As cases spread around the globe, the extent of infections in the U.S. remains to be seen. So far, over 1,600 cases have been reported. That number is sure to rise in the near future, but a historic wave of decisions in the public and private sectors meant to limit exposure and transmission could help curb the spread of the virus -- with major sporting events and schools and other venues being closed, and many businesses moving to telework policies for now. According to the CDC, between 2009 and 2010, swine flu resulted in over 60 million U.S. cases, and more than 12,000 deaths. It remains unclear at this stage how the novel coronavirus will compare. Biden's plan to fight the coronavirus, he said Thursday, includes emergency paid leave for people sick because of the virus, assistance to small businesses, free testing, the development of a vaccine and the mobilization of government supplies and workers to combat the disease. Biden said, ""protecting the health and safety of the American people is the most important job of any president. Unfortunately, this virus laid bare the severe shortcomings of the current administration. Public fears are being compounded by pervasive lack of trust in this president, fueled by an adversarial relationship with truth that he continues to have. Our government’s ability to respond effectively has been undermined by hollowing out our agencies and disparagement of science."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP One of the main faults Biden flagged with the administration's response to the coronavirus is the delays in rolling out tests for the disease caused by the coronavirus, known officially as COVID-19. ""The administration's failure on testing is colossal. And it's a failure of planning, leadership and execution,"" he said, ""By next week, the number of tests should be in the millions, not the thousands.""

"                          Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden says the coronavirus pandemic does not have a political affiliation, requires a national response. U.S. Rep. Dan Crenshaw fired back overnight after former Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden criticized President Trump’s actions on the coronavirus outbreak. “A wall will not stop the coronavirus,” Biden wrote on Twitter on Thursday night, attempting to link the outbreak to Trump’s signature immigration goal of a strong barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border. “Banning all travel from Europe – or any other part of the world – will not stop it,” Biden continued, taking aim at the temporary travel policy Trump announced this week. “This disease could impact every nation and any person on the planet – and we need a plan to combat it.” CORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN Biden’s tweet echoed comments he made the same day in a speech in his home state of Delaware, which he represented in the U.S. Senate for more than three decades before becoming vice president under former President Obama. But Crenshaw, a freshman Republican congressman from Texas, spotted what he viewed as flaws in Biden’s thinking and shared his thoughts in a Twitter message of his own. “First, walls quite literally stop a virus,” Crenshaw wrote. “It’s kind of the whole point of a quarantine, for instance. “Second, assuming you meant this metaphorically, health experts like Dr. Fauci and everyone else agree travel restrictions have vastly slowed the spread of the virus in the US.” Crenshaw was referring to Dr. Anthony Fauci, a respected immunologist with the National Institutes of Health who serves on the president’s Coronavirus Task Force, charged with crafting the federal government’s response to the outbreak under the direction of Vice President Mike Pence. Earlier in the week, Fauci told Fox News’ Sean Hannity there was “no question” that Trump’s initial travel restriction targeting China – epicenter of the outbreak – had helped protect the U.S. “Yes, there's no question that if we had not done that in a timely way, there would have been many more travel-related cases from China,” Fauci said during an appearance on “Hannity.” “And as you know, the outbreak that we're having here in the country, these cases originated from travel-related cases that came from China -- and then we had the issue in Washington state and what we're seeing now in other states. “So, coming from outside within was the thing that started it. So, I think [Trump’s travel restriction against flights from China] saved us a lot of — a lot of concern and a lot of suffering, I think.” Meanwhile, many people concerned they might have been exposed to the virus – but not yet certain, as they await testing or testing results – have voluntarily quarantined themselves in hopes of avoiding spreading the virus to others. The self-quarantining individuals have included members of Congress as well as professional sports figures — all of whom travel extensively, coming in contact with large numbers of people in multiple parts of the country, as part of their work.

Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders may be getting lots of media attention as the battle for their party’s presidential nomination heats up, but voters in Iowa appear to be solidly behind President Trump for November. Trump leads Biden 51 percent to 41 percent and leads Sanders 53 percent to 41 percent in Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll results released Thursday. TRUMP CAMPAIGN MOCKS DEM PRIMARY BATTLE, SAYS PRESIDENT ON 'UNSTOPPABLE DRIVE TOWARD REELECTION' The same poll, conducted March 2-5, also showed Trump with a 50 percent approval rating in Iowa – the president’s highest ever in the Hawkeye State, according to the Register. The president’s strongest support in Iowa was among Republicans (94 percent), rural Iowans (68 percent), evangelicals (63 percent), men (60 percent), and those with annual income of $100,000 or greater (57 percent). Iowans supported Barack Obama for president in both 2008 and 2012 but were all in for Trump in 2016 over Hillary Clinton, backing the New York businessman by a greater margin than traditionally conservative states such as Texas, The Hill reported.

"                          How are hospitals preparing? Fox News contributor Dr. Nicole Saphier weighs in. Gov.  Gavin Newsom, the California Democrat, released an executive order on Thursday that includes the authority for Sacramento to take over hotels and motels for medical use for coronavirus patients, in a move he said will help the state of 40 million prepare for any widespread outbreak. Some patients in the state have already been moved to hotels. The Desert Sun reported that a 120-room hotel in  San Carlos, which is near San Francisco, has been already tapped to house passengers from the Grand Princess cruise ship. The first-term governor told reporters that besides hotels and motels, state officials are also scouting for potential lodging in ""mothballed"" facilities and state parks. TOM HANKS SHARES HEALTH UPDATE The executive order, according to the report, has been designed to allow the state’s Health and Human Services Agency and the Office of Emergency Services to commandeer private property for coronavirus treatment. It also offers economic relief for residents. “This is where we need to go next, and to make sure we fully implement those procedures and protocols to slow down the spread to get through a peak and to get through the next few months, so we don’t overwhelm our healthcare delivery system,” Newsom said, according to the Los Angeles Times. The report pointed out that there are 198 known cases of COVID -19 in the state of about 40 million.  GET THE LATEST ON THE CORONAVIRUS State and local leaders were weighing short-term help for small businesses and individuals, with Newsom’s executive order eliminating a one-week waiting period for unemployment benefits.

"                          Reaction and analysis from former deputy assistant attorney general John Yoo. In a sign of these volatile times, President Trump’s Oval Office speech wasn’t even the most noteworthy thing that happened that hour. In rapid succession, starting at 9 p.m. eastern Wednesday, Tom Hanks revealed that he and his wife have the coronavirus, and the NBA suspended its season after one player tested positive. By the next morning, the stock market continued to crater, forcing a second automatic trading halt, as the Dow plunged another 2,300 points—capping a collapse that wiped out more than 80 percent of its gains during the Trump years. JOURNALISTS FEAR CONTRACTING VIRUS AS COVERAGE INCREASINGLY CRITICIZED And by yesterday afternoon, the NCAA had pulled the plug on the March Madness tournament. Major League Baseball had canceled spring training and delayed Opening Day by at least two weeks. The NHL had also frozen the hockey season. This may well be the new normal, as everyone in America struggles to cope with a pandemic that has altered our lives in ways large and small. The media, which have also been deeply affected, is scrambling just to keep pace with the breakneck pace of developments. It’s really no longer a question of whether journalists are hyping the virus, it’s a business trying to shovel out information that is changing hour by hour. The sports cancellations may be a blow to fans, but the mushrooming wave of colleges sending students packing (in favor of online classes) is disrupting the lives of countless families. Some public school systems are taking, or weighing, similar steps. And Broadway is shutting down, at least until the middle of April. Who thought we’d be living in a world where states like New York and California are banning gatherings of more than 250 or 500 people? Or where the Capitol and White House would announce yesterday that they’re essentially closed to the public? For all the personal hardships and inconveniences, a news flash like Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson announcing they have the virus—from Australia, where he’s filming an Elvis Presley movie—is more than a gossip item. Hanks is a beloved figure who played Mr. Rogers without being out of character. But more than that, as the first celebrity to contract the disease, he is now the face of the virus crisis. And it was easier for the couple to get tested in Sydney than it would have been in the States. SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES This has gotten personal, as well, for the people who cover the story. The Washington Post and New York Times are encouraging staffers to work at home. CBS has shut down its New York headquarters after two confirmed cases. The network morning shows, late-night shows, and other programs like “The View” have dropped their studio audiences. So when Trump delivered his White House speech, he was confronting a threat that goes well beyond political warfare. It is now a cultural calamity. The president’s sober tone was good, a significant departure from many earlier comments in which he minimized the impact of the virus and blamed public concern on the media and the Democrats. But the steps he announced were limited, and he didn’t really address the lack of widespread testing that people across the spectrum agree has been the most significant failure in this mess. What really undercut the Trump speech were the hasty corrections afterwards, such as that the 30-day ban on travel from Europe doesn’t apply to American citizens or residents, or to trade between the countries. How does what was arguably the most important address of his presidency not get vetted more carefully than that? Maybe no presidential speech could have totally calmed the country. Perhaps no words from Washington could stop a Wall Street slide that reflects global economic damage. But there is a deep sense of unease in the country that transcends politics, one that isn’t likely to fade any time soon.

"                          President Trump and members of the coronavirus task force hold news conference from the White House, detailing additional steps the federal government is taking to stop the spread of coronavirus. President Trump on Friday declared a national emergency over the coronavirus outbreak amid extensive disruptions to the economy and American life, announcing partnerships with major U.S. companies to expand testing capabilities while saying he believes the crisis ""will pass.” The president also announced that he would likely be tested for coronavirus “fairly soon,” after having been in contact with several individuals who have self-quarantined, or tested positive, for the virus. Speaking to reporters, the president also said his administration is working to ""dramatically increase the availability of tests,"" amid concerns over the availability of tests for coronavirus, or COVID-19, across the country. WHAT AN EMERGENCY DECLARATION MEANS “We are announcing a new partnership with the private sector to vastly increase and accelerate our capacity to test for the coronavirus,” Trump said during the Rose Garden press conference. “We want people to take a test quickly if they need. But we don’t want people to take the test if we feel they shouldn’t be doing it.” The president’s declaration of a national emergency means that he will enact the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, which allows the White House to mobilize the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and direct federal aid to states hit by disasters and health crises. President Trump addresses the media during coronavirus news conference from the White House. ""I am officially declaring a national emergency -- two very big words,"" Trump continued. ""The action I am taking will open up access to up to $50 billion...and a large amount of money for states, territories and localities."" He added: ""We&apos;ve been working very hard on this. We will overcome the threat of the virus."" According to the latest FEMA report to Congress, which was transmitted Feb. 29, 2020, there is $42.6 billion in the Disaster Relief Fund, which can be tapped under a Stafford Act declaration. In addition to declaring an emergency under the Stafford Act, the president also declared an emergency under the National Emergencies Act, which allows the Department of Health and Human Services to waive certain guidelines related to Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP to address the coronavirus. TRUMP SAYS HE WILL ‘MOST LIKELY’ BE TESTED FOR CORONAVIRUS ‘FAIRLY SOON’ During his speech, Trump was joined by the official coronavirus task force, led by Vice President Pence and leaders of major corporations and businesses, including Target, Walgreens, Quest Diagnostics and CVS Health. Trump said that with federal emergency authorities, the Food and Drug Administration approved a new test of the virus, which would provide “half a million additional tests” that will be available “early next week.” ""Our overriding goal is to stop the spread of this virus and help Americans impacted by this,” he said. “Again, we don’t want everyone to take the test.” He added: “This will pass…It’s going to pass through…and we’ll be all the stronger for it.” The declaration of a national emergency also cuts through red tape with Medicare, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program; chief White House correspondent John Roberts reports. Meanwhile, the president said he would ask hospitals across the nation to activate their ""emergency preparedness plans,"" and said his designation of a national emergency would allow HHS Secretary Alexander Azar to waive ""provisions of applicable laws and regulations"" to give medical professionals and hospitals the ""flexibility"" to care for all patients. The president said that Azar will have the ability to enable ""telehealth"" for remote doctor visits and hospital check-ins, and the ability to waive hospital stay limits, as well as obtain additional office and hospital space. ""They can now do as they want and do what they have to do, they know what they have to do now, they don&apos;t have any problem getting it done,"" Trump said. The Trump administration has also partnered with pharmacies and retailers to make drive-through tests available in “critical locations” identified by public health professionals, he said. “The goal is for individuals to be able to drive up and be swabbed without having to leave your car,” Trump said, while thanking Google for creating a website to help implement the drive-through test taking technology. Trump said Google was going to “very quickly” get the website “done, unlike websites in the past,” he said in a veiled and apparent swipe at the Obama administration’s roll-out of healthcare.gov. “Google has 1,700 engineers working on this right now,” Trump said. But that wasn&apos;t his only swipe at the Obama administration Friday. Trump was asked about the H1N1 pandemic--which former President Barack Obama declared a national emergency over in 2009. Read: Trump letter declaring coronavirus national emergency under Stafford Act by Fox News on Scribd ""It was nothing like this and they actually lost approximately 14,000 people,"" Trump said, slamming the Obama administration for thinking about testing ""far too late."" ""We’ve done it very early and we’ve also kept a lot of people out,"" Trump said. In response to a question, reminding Trump that the past administration had tested ""1 million people,"" he replied: ""They had a very big failure with swine flu. Very big failure."" In recent days, major sporting and other events were called off or postponed, businesses across the country instituted telework policies, government buildings and schools shuttered and other disruptions rock the nation, amid efforts to curb the transmission of the virus. ""We have to make short term sacrifices which will produce long term gains,"" Trump said, while praising the cancellation of national sporting leagues as having done ""a great service."" ""We&apos;re with you every step of the way. No nation is more prepared or more equipped to face this, as you know,"" Trump said. ""With faith and heart and hope, we will succeeed and we will prevail. We will be very, very successful and learn for the future."" The president also said that he would waive interest on federally held student loans and moved to prop up energy markets, by directing the Department of Energy to buy oil to fill the strategic petroleum reserve ""right up to the top."" Every U.S. president since 1976 has declared at least one national emergency. Former President Obama declared an emergency in 2009 over the H1N1 influenza pandemic and former President George W. Bush declared two national emergencies in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. Trump&apos;s announcement Friday also comes amid conflicting reports over whether another person who came in contact with Trump in recent days—Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro—tested positive. The president, decisively, told reporters that he does not have any symptoms of coronavirus. ""I don&apos;t have any of the symptoms...White House doctors, and there are a lot of them, say you don&apos;t have any symptoms whatsoever,"" Trump said. ""And we don&apos;t want people without symptoms to go out and do the test."" He added: ""The test is not insignificant."" The announcement of the national emergency also comes after the World Health Organization designated COVID-19 a global pandemic. Following that designation, the president announced a temporary halt on air travel to the United States from Europe, excluding flights from the United Kingdom and those carrying cargo, in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. ""As you know, Europe was just designated as the hot spot right now and we closed it,"" Trump said Friday, questioning whether it was a matter of ""talent or through luck"" to act early. ""Call it whatever you want,"" Trump said, noting any families returning from Europe ""will be subject to extra screening or a period of isolation for 14 days.""

In a 363-40 vote early Saturday, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a coronavirus response package negotiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. All House Democrats supported the plan while 40 Republicans opposed it. Rep. Justin Amash, an independent from Michigan who is a former Republican, voted ""present."" Prior to the vote, which occurred shortly before 1 a.m. ET Saturday, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., spoke to reporters about the deal that had been worked out, saying ""some things needed to be cleaned up."" President Trump said Friday night that he supported the package -- in an apparent effort to get skeptical House Republicans on board with the legislation. ""I fully support H.R. 6201: Families First CoronaVirus Response Act, which will be voted on in the House this evening,"" Trump tweeted. ""This Bill will follow my direction for free CoronaVirus tests, and paid sick leave for our impacted American workers ..."" ""I encourage all Republicans and Democrats to come together and VOTE YES!"" Trump later added. ""I will always put the health and well-being of Americans FIRST. Look forward to signing the final bill, ASAP!"" Pelosi intially informed colleagues of a deal with the Trump administration at around 6 p.m. ET Friday. “We are proud to have reached an agreement with the administration to resolve outstanding challenges, and now will soon pass the Families First Coronavirus Response Act,” the California Democrat said in a letter. However, Fox News later learned that Mnuchin had not yet signed off on the pact. TRUMP DECLARES NATIONAL EMERGENCY OVER CORONAVIRUS, ENLISTS PRIVATE SECTOR Shortly before 8 p.m. ET, Mnuchin told Fox Business Network&apos;s ""Lou Dobbs Tonight"": ""We have an agreement that reflects what the president talked about in his speech the other [Wednesday] night. He&apos;s very focused on making sure that we can deal with the coronavirus, that people who have to be home quarantined -- that hard-working Americans don&apos;t lose their compensation because they have to be home quarantined. ""Obviously we expect the bigger corporations to pick up these costs,"" Mnuchin added, ""and we also want to make sure that people can get free testing. The president wants lots of testing. One of the things the market responded very positively to was [that] the president has made just enormous progress with all these big companies coming in and saying that there&apos;s testing."" The apparent problems caught Democrats by surprise: House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said “we thought we had an agreement,” adding: “I want to vote tonight.” Fox News is told the major objection to the bill from House Republicans was extraneous matters House Democrats kept trying to include in the coronavirus package. Shortly before 10 p.m., Pelosi informed her Democratic caucus that the ""process has taken some time,"" adding that “language incorporating the last details into the text is currently being written and should be completed soon.” Sources told Fox that if the measure passed the House with an overwhelming majority, the Senate would take it up next week. Earlier Friday, President Trump declared a national emergency over the coronavirus outbreak and announced partnerships with major U.S. companies to expand testing capabilities. “This legislation is about testing, testing, testing,” Pelosi said. “To stop the spread of the virus, we have secured free coronavirus testing for everyone who needs a test, including the uninsured. We cannot fight coronavirus effectively unless everyone in our country who needs to be tested can get their test free of charge.” CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE According to Pelosi, the bill includes paid emergency leave with two weeks of paid sick leave and up to three months of paid family and medical leave. “We have also secured enhanced unemployment insurance, a step that will extend protections to furloughed workers,” she said. Pelosi also said the bill will include nutrition security initiatives “including SNAP, student meals, seniors’ nutrition and food banks.” The Democrat said “22 million children rely on free or reduced-price school meals for their food security; we must ensure that they have food to eat.” She also said the bill will include increased federal funds for Medicaid to support local, state, tribal and territorial governments and health systems “so that they have the resources necessary to combat this crisis.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The revisions to the Democratic bill happened after the GOP flagged “major” concerns about the sick leave legislation on Thursday. McCarthy criticized the initial legislation for creating a paid sick leave program through the Social Security Administration that he said would take six months to set up and hamper the agency’s normal functioning of disbursing checks to senior citizens. He also objected to forcing permanent paid sick leave ""for all businesses without exemptions and no sunsets,"" McCarthy said. Late Friday, McCarthy told reporters the bill ""had some things which needed to be cleaned up."" ""This is a really good sign that shows bipartisanship, that we can overcome this virus,"" he said. "" ... It was very important to get this done before anybody departed."" Trump had pressed for a payroll tax holiday to give some economic relief to Americans, but Pelosi has not included that in this bill, though she&apos;s signaled more legislation could be needed as the scope and hurt of the pandemic is fully realized.

"                          Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders addresses the changes being made to his campaign during the outbreak. Sen. Bernie Sanders says the coronavirus outbreak “has radically changed our campaign.” Speaking with reporters Friday from his hometown of Burlington, Vt., the populist senator -- who’s making his second straight bid for the Democratic presidential nomination -- acknowledged that “we are in the process of thinking this through but this coronavirus has obviously impacted our ability to communicate with people in the tradition that we do and that’s hurting.” THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN  Welcome to a presidential race without a traditional campaign trail -- where virtual campaigning is fast becoming the new normal. While Sanders is hunkered down in his hometown, Biden’s doing the same as he remains in Wilmington, Del. Both candidates will travel to the nation’s capital for Sunday’s Democratic presidential nomination debate. The faceoff between the two remaining major Democratic contenders was moved to a TV studio in Washington, D.C., after a live audience in Arizona was abruptly canceled this week due to concerns over the grown coronavirus pandemic. With traditional rallies and town halls a thing of the past, following warnings against large gatherings coming from public and health officials on Friday, Biden held his first virtual town hall with Illinois voters ahead of their Tuesday presidential primary. “We’ll continue to assess and adjust how we conduct our campaign as we move forward and find new ways to share our message with the public while putting the health and safety of the American people first,” Biden said on Thursday. His campaign also announced that fundraisers with top-dollar donors -- which the former vice president had almost always done in person -- were also going the virtual route. On Friday, Sanders highlighted that he’ll showcase what he said was an already-robust online campaign. “What I think we have going for us which we’ve always had going for us but what we’re going to utilize even more is our internet capabilities. We have many, many millions of people follow us on Twitter, follow us on other platforms. We livestream everything that we do,” the senator said. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK  Both campaigns are asking their staff at their national headquarters and at field offices across the country to work from home. “Our staff is now by and large working at home,” Sanders noted. And top Biden officials also said that starting on Saturday that “all Biden for president employees both in our Philadelphia headquarters and in field offices across the country will work from home.” Bayou State postponement  Louisiana moved to postpone its April 4 presidential primary due to concerns over the coronavirus outbreak, state election officials announced Friday. The primary -- which includes mayoral races and local propositions, as well as the presidential ballot -- will instead be held June 20, Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin announced at a news conference in Baton Rouge. Christina Stephens, a spokeswoman for Louisiana Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards, told Fox News the governor was expected to sign an executive order later on Friday officially moving the election to June. Louisiana is the first state that’s holding an upcoming primary or caucus to move to delay their contest. Louisiana is one of only five states that gives governors the power to move elections due to an emergency. Sanders, when asked about the postponement of Louisiana&apos;s primary, told reporters that ""elections are the bedrock of our democracy and we don’t want to be delaying elections on a willy nilly basis."" But he stressed that ""there is obviously a growing concern about bringing people together and spreading the virus... I don’t think there’s anybody out there -- no matter what your political view may be -- that wants to see people become infected because they are voting."" Last-minute polling place changes  Four states hold primaries on Tuesday – Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio. Election officials in the four states are making last-minute moves -- such as moving polling places away from locations with heavy concentrations of high-risk people, such as nursing homes. Meanwhile, Arizona&apos;s Secretary of State&apos;s office told Fox News it couldn&apos;t move the date of their primary because it would require legislative action. The secretary of states of Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio put out a joint statement emphasizing that “we are working closely with our state health officials to ensure that our poll workers and voters can be confident that voting is safe.” “Unlike concerts, sporting events or other mass gatherings where large groups of people travel long distances to congregate in a confined space for an extended period of time, polling locations see people from a nearby community coming into and out of the building for a short duration,” they noted. And the secretary of states highlighted that “guidance from voting machine manufacturers on how best to sanitize machines, guidance from CDC on best practices for hand washing, and guidance from our respective state health officials is being provided to every polling location.” &apos;Get tested&apos; Sanders is one of the latest in a growing list of people to urge that President Trump get tested for coronavirus, which is officially known as COVID-19. CLICK HERE FOR FOX NEWS&apos; COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE  Asked on Friday by Fox News if the president should take a test, Sanders answered: “I would. You know, I was asked early on, to the best of my knowledge, I have not been in proximity to somebody who had the virus. If I knew that I was, I would get tested, and I think that holds true for the president.” The president has recently been in contact with a number of people who have tested positive for the virus. On Friday afternoon -- after declaring a national emergency in response to the pandemic -- Trump said he will “most likely” be tested for coronavirus “fairly soon.” But the president shook hands with some of those who joined him for the major announcement. That violated a major rule his public health officials have stressed, to avoid shaking hands. Fox News&apos; Lee Ross and Andrew Craft contributed to this report.

"                          Why the global number of coronavirus cases are likely much higher; Dr. Marty Makary gives his take. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio doubled down Friday on his decision not to shut down public schools, despite increasing pressure to do so from teacher unions and other Democratic politicians. “We shut down the school system, we might not see it for the rest of the school year. We might not see the beginning of the new school year. And that weighs heavily on me,” the mayor said, according to The New York Times. CORONAVIRUS HAS NEW YORKERS WAKING UP IN A CITY THAT NEVER SLEEPS TO BIG CHANGES  Public schools in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Atlanta and other cities have closed down due to the coronavirus outbreak. There have been statewide closures in some states, including Virginia, Ohio and Washington state. New York is temporarily closing schools where students or teachers test positive for the virus, but the state has so far held off on broader closures. In the Big Apple, shutting down schools would be one of the most consequential shutdowns in the country, and some have expressed concerns about possible ripple effects.  Workers in crucial areas such as transportion and medical care, for instance, may have to take time off to care for children. Many low-income families also rely on schools for meals, medical help and even laundry services. But teacher unions have increased pressure on de Blasio, a Democrat, to shutter schools, saying it is an important move to stop the spread of a deadly virus that has turned into a pandemic. CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE “We must find ways to keep our children safe and to see that they are fed. We must do all we can to help ensure that our students can continue to learn,” United Federation of Teachers President Michael Mulgrew said in a statement. “But we have reached the point where continuing to keep our classrooms open poses a greater lasting threat than the disruption that will result from school closings.” NYC Council Speaker Corey Johnson, who supports the closures, tweeted: “Teaching and learning cannot take place under these circumstances."" “The City must immediately come up with a plan that includes childcare relief for families who need it so that our essential workers, especially healthcare workers, can continue with their duties,” he said. But de Blasio still has the support of other leaders, including Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has the power to shut down schools statewide but has so far not chosen to do so. According to the Times, Cuomo has said that evidence from other hard-hit countries is unclear on whether children were carriers of the virus. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW De Blasio brushed off the criticism from those calling for closures, saying: “This isn’t a popularity contest -- this is war.” His decision to keep schools open has drawn support from other unions, such as those representing health care workers. “While calls to close New York City’s public schools are being received, we urge Mayor de Blasio to recognize the plight of the healthcare workers, transit workers, and other essential workers who are unable to take time off,” George Gresham, the president of 1199SEIU, said in a statement. “These hardworking women and men rely on our public schools to not only educate their children, but to provide a safe environment for them while their parents work.” CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP “Closing New York City’s public schools with no care plan for these children would place a dire strain on our social infrastructure by reducing the healthcare workforce, and possibly halting the gains being made to help curb the spread of COVID-19. This would undoubtedly pose an even greater danger to New York’s families,” he said. The debate within New York City comes as the country as a whole is taking increased steps to combat the virus. President Trump on Friday declared a national emergency in order to free up nearly $50 billion in funding for states. The House passed a coronavirus response package late Friday, sending it to the Senate for consideration.

""We are a Country that, throughout our history, has looked to God for protection and strength in times like these....,"" Trump tweeted. ""No matter where you may be, I encourage you to turn towards prayer in an act of faith. Together, we will easily PREVAIL!"" The annual National Day of Prayer is scheduled for May 7. Trump&apos;s announcement came after he declared a national emergency over the coronavirus pandemic, in addition to partnerships with several large companies to expand testing for the illness. Trump has large support from white evangelical Christians and Catholic voters. As president, he&apos;s championed religious liberty and called for greater religious freedoms, such as strengthening prayer in public schools. In addition to the updated guidance on prayer in schools, the Trump administration also took action across nine federal agencies, releasing proposed rules to ensure religious organizations are not discriminated against by the federal government.

By a 26-point spread, voters have a more positive than negative view of capitalism (56 favorable - 30 unfavorable). The opposite holds true for socialism, where sentiment is net negative by 30 points (28 favorable - 58 unfavorable). CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS That’s almost exactly where things stood a year ago, despite the popularity of Sen. Bernie Sanders&apos;, I-Vt., presidential campaign. The Democratic presidential frontrunner says “billionaires should not exist,” yet 76 percent of voters overall and 67 percent of Democrats think it’s a good thing people can become billionaires in the United States. For many though, there are limits.  Voters agree by a 56-35 percent margin the government “should increase taxes on the wealthiest individuals so that nobody gets to be too rich.”  A decade ago, it was the reverse: 40 percent favored increased taxes and 55 percent disagreed. Billionaires, generically, garner somewhat negative ratings in the poll (35 favorable - 44 unfavorable).  Mere millionaires are a bit more popular (41 favorable - 39 unfavorable).  One in five voters is unable to give an opinion of either millionaires or billionaires. Views among groups Twice as many Democrats (40 percent) as Republicans (15 percent) feel positively about socialism. Republicans (67 percent) are more likely than Democrats (50 percent) to have a favorable view of capitalism. Men are 26 points more likely than women to have a favorable view of capitalism (70 vs. 44 percent).  That gender gap disappears on socialism, as roughly equal numbers of men (29 percent) and women (27 percent) feel positively. Voters ages 65 and over are far more likely than those under age 35 to like capitalism (72 vs. 44 percent), and young voters are more than twice as likely as seniors to have a favorable view of socialism (35 vs. 16 percent).

"                          Lawyers for the House Judiciary Committee say they're not ruling out impeaching President Trump again; Mark Meredith reports from Washington. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia is set to rehear the lawsuit launched by House Democrats to enforce a subpoena against former White House Counsel Don McGahn. The appeals court granted the Democrat-led House Judiciary Committee&apos;s request to rehear the lawsuit en banc. Oral arguments are scheduled for April 28. A three-judge panel ruled against the committee&apos;s efforts to force McGahn to testify, dealing a blow to House Democrats in litigation they have been pursuing since shortly after former Special Counsel Robert Mueller&apos;s report on Russian election interference was released. The committee hopes a hearing before all 11 judges on the circuit court will give it a more favorable result. APPEALS COURT DISMISSES DEM EFFORT TO FORCE EX-WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL DON MCGAHN TO TESTIFY ""The Committee’s petition argues that the panel’s ruling misread binding precedent and – if allowed to stand – would severely undermine the House’s ability to perform its constitutional functions as a check on the Executive Branch,"" Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said in a statement Friday. He added: ""In fact, none other than President Trump’s own lawyers told the American people over and over again during the impeachment trial that the House should have gone to court to enforce its subpoenas. In addition, two of the three judges on the panel strongly suggested that they would reject President Trump’s claim of &apos;absolute immunity&apos; if they were able to reach the merits of the case."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In the Mueller report released last April, McGahn was supposedly a central witness to alleged attempts by President Trump to obstruct justice in the investigation — including one incident where McGahn supposedly stymied an attempt by Trump to fire Mueller himself by threatening to resign if Trump went through with it. McGahn played a key role in the White House&apos;s legal operations, including the nominations and confirmations of Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. The Judiciary Committee subpoenaed McGahn about a month after the report&apos;s release, but the Trump administration claimed that McGahn had absolute immunity from being forced to testify to congressional investigators.

"                          Reaction and analysis from former deputy assistant attorney general John Yoo. In a sign of these volatile times, President Trump’s Oval Office speech wasn’t even the most noteworthy thing that happened that hour. In rapid succession, starting at 9 p.m. eastern Wednesday, Tom Hanks revealed that he and his wife have the coronavirus, and the NBA suspended its season after one player tested positive. By the next morning, the stock market continued to crater, forcing a second automatic trading halt, as the Dow plunged another 2,300 points—capping a collapse that wiped out more than 80 percent of its gains during the Trump years. JOURNALISTS FEAR CONTRACTING VIRUS AS COVERAGE INCREASINGLY CRITICIZED And by yesterday afternoon, the NCAA had pulled the plug on the March Madness tournament. Major League Baseball had canceled spring training and delayed Opening Day by at least two weeks. The NHL had also frozen the hockey season. This may well be the new normal, as everyone in America struggles to cope with a pandemic that has altered our lives in ways large and small. The media, which have also been deeply affected, is scrambling just to keep pace with the breakneck pace of developments. It’s really no longer a question of whether journalists are hyping the virus, it’s a business trying to shovel out information that is changing hour by hour. The sports cancellations may be a blow to fans, but the mushrooming wave of colleges sending students packing (in favor of online classes) is disrupting the lives of countless families. Some public school systems are taking, or weighing, similar steps. And Broadway is shutting down, at least until the middle of April. Who thought we’d be living in a world where states like New York and California are banning gatherings of more than 250 or 500 people? Or where the Capitol and White House would announce yesterday that they’re essentially closed to the public? For all the personal hardships and inconveniences, a news flash like Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson announcing they have the virus—from Australia, where he’s filming an Elvis Presley movie—is more than a gossip item. Hanks is a beloved figure who played Mr. Rogers without being out of character. But more than that, as the first celebrity to contract the disease, he is now the face of the virus crisis. And it was easier for the couple to get tested in Sydney than it would have been in the States. SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE&apos;S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY&apos;S HOTTEST STORIES This has gotten personal, as well, for the people who cover the story. The Washington Post and New York Times are encouraging staffers to work at home. CBS has shut down its New York headquarters after two confirmed cases. The network morning shows, late-night shows, and other programs like “The View” have dropped their studio audiences. So when Trump delivered his White House speech, he was confronting a threat that goes well beyond political warfare. It is now a cultural calamity. The president’s sober tone was good, a significant departure from many earlier comments in which he minimized the impact of the virus and blamed public concern on the media and the Democrats. But the steps he announced were limited, and he didn’t really address the lack of widespread testing that people across the spectrum agree has been the most significant failure in this mess. What really undercut the Trump speech were the hasty corrections afterwards, such as that the 30-day ban on travel from Europe doesn’t apply to American citizens or residents, or to trade between the countries. How does what was arguably the most important address of his presidency not get vetted more carefully than that? Maybe no presidential speech could have totally calmed the country. Perhaps no words from Washington could stop a Wall Street slide that reflects global economic damage. But there is a deep sense of unease in the country that transcends politics, one that isn’t likely to fade any time soon.

"                          Former Vice President Joe Biden swept to victory in Michigan's pivotal primary contest Tuesday, capturing four more states; Biden deputy campaign manager and communications director Kate Bedingfield discusses Biden's biggest challenge as campaign rolls on. I’ll be brief. In the spirit of Joe Biden now giving seven-minute speeches—the better to limit possible gaffes—I will be as terse as possible in assessing the Democratic race. I won’t say it’s over. The reason is that too many people in my profession declared Biden a dead man walking in what now looks like a spectacular failure of judgment. And the entire media and political establishment said there was no flippin’ way that Donald Trump was going to beat Hillary Clinton. But do I see much daylight for a possible Bernie comeback? As hard as I might squint, it’s very difficult. JOURNALISTS FEAR CONTRACTING VIRUS AS COVERAGE INCREASINGLY CRITICIZED When Biden routed Sanders in Michigan, where the democratic socialist had made a last stand of sorts, it was clear he was headed for another big night of Super Tuesday proportions. He clobbered Sanders in Missouri and Mississippi. He even won Idaho. And while Biden lost North Dakota, the fact that he’s trailing by a fraction of a percent in Washington state is a remarkable comeback by itself. And Biden replicated his stunning coalition of blacks, working-class whites, women, suburbanites and older voters, losing only younger people excited by Bernie’s sweeping and costly agenda. So when Sanders called in the media yesterday afternoon, there was understandable speculation that he might be dropping out. He admitted that he is losing the delegate race as well as the electability argument, but said he’d fight on, starting with Sunday’s CNN debate. And he took no questions. The problem for Bernie is that he’s fighting on unfavorable turf—he’ll most likely get pounded next week in Florida and Georgia—which makes it even more difficult to close the gap in delegates. The Washington Post headline on Dan Balz’s analysis: “Biden Appears to be on an unstoppable march to the nomination.” The always measured Balz writes that “barring something unforeseen, Democrats now know that former vice president Joe Biden will be the party’s nominee to challenge President Trump in November…there is little to give Sanders any confidence that he can reverse the trends enough to overtake the surging Biden.” SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE&apos;S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY&apos;S HOTTEST STORIES Politico is even more definitive: “In every way other than mathematically, his presidential campaign is done.” The piece says that for the first time the Sanders camp has no excuse, since Elizabeth Warren dropped out and he got the two-man contest he’s long wanted. The New York Times says this of Biden’s “dominant position”: “So thorough is Mr. Biden’s hold on the party now that any collapse would probably require a political U-turn as sharp as the one that precipitated his rise.” And the Atlantic headline on Ron Brownstein’s piece simply says, “It’s Over.” I did get the impression from Bernie’s tone yesterday that he’s playing out the string. As a veteran politician, he must know he faces Mission Impossible and is trying to extend his time in the spotlight to argue for his ideas. And Biden faces his own set of pressures, to win over Bernie supporters for the fall campaign. One last point—I know, I’m almost done—comes from Times conservative columnist Ross Douthat. He says the coronavirus boosted Joe, that with this burgeoning crisis there is “a flight to safety, the surrender of grand plans and big ambitions in favor of a desire to just survive. Michigan voted for Biden overwhelmingly for the same reason that both Biden and Sanders canceled rallies just before the vote — because this is now the coronavirus election, against whose stark existential stakes all normal political battles must give way.” I think there’s something to that. A crisis like what the WHO now calls a pandemic leads people to want to play it safe, and whether the criticism of President Trump is warranted or not, they find a former vice president more reassuring than a maverick preaching revolution. Okay, I’m done. Thank you all for coming.

"                          The coronavirus is causing major adjustments to the Democratic presidential contest for former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy reports. WASHINGTON — As the two remaining Democratic presidential candidates return to the debate stage, their party, the stakes, and the world look much different than in their last meeting less than three weeks ago. The fast-moving coronavirus was something of an afterthought in that debate; now the escalating crisis is likely to dominate Sunday’s contest. Rising infections in the United States and around the world have prompted a dramatic slowdown of global travel, upended financial markets, and raised questions about President Donald Trump’s ability to lead the nation through a prolonged period of uncertainty. Just two Democrats — former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders — remain to make the case that they are best-positioned to challenge Trump in November. Five other candidates who joined them on stage in the Feb. 25 debate in South Carolina have dropped out, with many rallying behind Biden’s surging candidacy.

They’ll aim to draw a contrast with Trump, but also with each other, arguing that they have the right experience, temperament and policy prescriptions to lead the nation through a crisis. “Moments like these don’t come around often in campaigns and this is a perfect opportunity to show millions that you have what it takes,” said Robert Gibbs, former White House press secretary and campaign adviser to President Barack Obama. “They must show voters they are the answer to what is missing right now by being calm, honest, ready to lead and empathetic.” ""This is a perfect opportunity to show millions that you have what it takes."" The coronavirus crisis rapidly upended plans for Sunday’s debate. First, the Democratic National Committee announced that it would hold the contest without a live audience. Then the debate was moved from a large venue in Arizona, one of the states holding a primary Tuesday, to a television studio in Washington because of concerns about cross-country travel. One of the moderators had to withdraw because of potential exposure to a person who tested positive for coronavirus. It is Biden who will step on stage as the front-runner, a distinction that seemed unlikely just a few weeks ago. After disappointing showings in the early contests, Biden roared back with a commanding victory in South Carolina and has continued to rack up wins across the country, winning broad and diverse coalitions of voters. Moderate Democratic leaders, including former rivals Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, have rallied behind his candidacy and voters have done the same. Advisers say Biden will aim in Sunday's debate to show voters who backed Sanders or other liberal candidates that they have a home in his campaign. In one overture to liberals, Biden announced his support for a bankruptcy plan championed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who ended her campaign earlier this month and has yet to endorse. In a virtual town hall on Friday, Biden said his support for Warren's proposal, which aims to simplify the bankruptcy process, is ""one of the things that I think Bernie and I will agree on."" Biden holds a solid lead over Sanders in the all-important delegate race, and a strong showing in Tuesday’s primary contests could effectively guarantee his nomination. Four big states will be up for grabs: Illinois, Ohio, Arizona and Florida, a perennial general election battleground where Biden appears to have an edge over Sanders. After a strong start, the race has moved rapidly away from Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist with a loyal following among young voters and liberals. But he’s failed to expand his appeal, particularly among black voters, and his calls for a sweeping political and economic revolution have also fallen flat with suburban voters. Sanders is facing some pressure from within the Democratic Party to step aside and allow Biden take Trump on one-on-one. Several Democratic groups that were waiting to endorse until after the primary have consolidated around Biden, including super PAC Priorities USA. Sanders’ advisers say he is a realist about his current standing and the difficulty of the path ahead. Yet the senator is pledging to grill Biden in Sunday’s debate on his plans for tackling college debt, for his past support of the Iraq war and for his backing of multilateral trade agreements. “I’m going to ask Joe Biden, I mean Joe is part of the establishment for a very long time, ‘Joe, what role have you played in trying to make sure that we end this massive level of income and wealth inequality where three people own more wealth than the bottom half of America?"" Sanders said Saturday during an online “fireside chat” with supporters. Yet it’s unclear if the issues Sanders is aiming to highlight will resonate with voters at a time when much of the nation’s focus has shifted to the growing toll of the coronavirus and put a spotlight on the need for presidential leadership. Schools and businesses across the country are closed, and many hospitals and clinics are struggling to obtain tests for the coronavirus. For Biden, the outbreak of a global pandemic has been a moment to bolster the central argument of his candidacy: that his eight years as vice president give him the experience, as well as the relationships in Washington and around the world, that are needed in the Oval Office during turbulent times. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE With campaign rallies halted because of warnings against large gatherings, Biden delivered a speech in front of reporters and advisers on his proposal for combating coronavirus, including guaranteeing free testing. Sanders’ later announced his own speech, which focused largely on advocating for his call to overhaul the nation’s health insurance system and replace it with a Medicare for All program. After Sunday’s debate, it’s unclear where the candidates and the campaign go from here. Neither Biden or Sanders has announced any public rallies for next week or given any indication of when they may be able to appear in person for voters again.

""This statement is in response to several false claims circulating online,"" a city press release read on Friday. ""To be clear, there is currently no firearm ban and no intent to seize property or close businesses. Additionally, there are no restrictions on the sale of alcohol or gas or the ability to enter or leave Champaign.""

""The ordinance in Champaign serves as a warning bell to law-abiding gun owners nationwide.  We must be on high alert for any attempts to destroy the Second Amendment in jurisdictions throughout the country,"" the alert read. The city said in its press release that municipal code has authorized a variety of powers since 2006. ""The Mayor has the authority to exercise other emergency powers under the Champaign Municipal Code Section 12-39, which have been in existence since 2006; however, and under the known circumstances, no further measures are anticipated,"" the city said.

"                           Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, has officially started serving as Ranking Member on the House Judiciary Committee, placing one of the president's most vocal defenders on a key committee before the 2020 elections. The Judiciary Committee announced on Friday that Jordan had taken over the position from Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., who was required, according to GOP conference rules, to step down as he pursues a Senate bid. At the beginning of February, the House GOP Steering Committee approved Jordan's new position in a ""totally unified decision all around,"" House GOP Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., reportedly said. Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., another vocal Trump supporter, is slated to take over Jordan's previous position as Ranking Member on the House Oversight Committee. Jordan entered Congress in 2007 and made a name for himself for, among other things, his fiery confrontations during hearings and his efforts investigating the 2011 attack on the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi, Libya. TRUMP ALLIES JORDAN, MEADOWS SELECTED FOR TOP HOUSE GOP COMMITTEE ROLES The Judiciary Committee was an integral part of Congress' attempts to investigate President Trump on several issues, including his July 25 phone call with the president of Ukraine. That incident led to an impeachment inquiry and ultimately, an acquittal in the U.S. Senate. Democrats have already indicated that they'll continue the Russia investigation in Congress as well as revisit impeachment, despite the Senate's acquittal. Both Jordan and Meadows served on the president's legal team during impeachment proceedings. As ranking member, Jordan will be in a key position to combat Democratic efforts to continue pursuing the president on issues like the Russia investigation. HOUSE PASSES BIPARTISAN FISA REFORMS TO PREVENT FUTURE 'SPYING' ABUSES Jordan has been a proponent of FISA reforms, claiming that the Justice Department illegally surveilled the president's adviser, Carter Page, during the 2016 election cycle.

"                          President Donald Trump and coronavirus task force team give updates on the disease in a White House briefing. The Trump administration will extend its European travel ban to include the U.K. and Ireland as part of continuing efforts to combat the coronavirus pandemic, President Trump said Saturday, before saying he was also looking at the possibility of domestic travel restrictions as well. “We are looking at it very seriously, yeah, because they’ve had a little bit of activity unfortunately,” he said when asked in the White House briefing room about reports that the European travel ban would be extended. “So we’re going to be looking at that -- we actually already have looked at it and that is going to be announced.” Asked if he was considering any domestic travel restrictions, Trump said: ""Yes, specifically from certain areas, yes we are."" ""We're working with the states and we're considering other restrictions, yes,"" he said. Vice President Mike Pence confirmed later in the briefing that the travel from U.K. and Ireland would be suspended as of midnight Monday night EDT. He said it was after the unanimous recommendation from health experts at the White House. EUROPEAN UNION LASHES OUT AT TRUMP OVER TRAVEL BAN AMID CORONAVIRUS CHAOS Pence emphasized that Americans currently abroad will be allowed to return home, but will be tested for the virus on their return through certain, limited airports. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said that it specifically applies to foreign nationals who have been in the U.K. or Ireland in the last 14 days and that it does not apply to U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents and foreign diplomats. It also does not apply to cargo. Wolf also said that major cruise lines have agreed to suspend outbound trips for 30 days, that smaller lines had followed suit, and that in some limited cases the government had given orders to ""a small handful"" to not sail. Those restrictions began late Friday, he said. As for whether the administration is considering travel restrictions within the U.S., Pence referred back to Trump's remarks and said ""we're considering a broad range of measures, but no decisions have been made yet."" Trump announced late Wednesday that travel from Europe would be restricted for 30 days -- but he initially exempted the U.K. and Ireland. The Department of Homeland Security went on to clarify that the ban affects most foreign nationals who were in Europe’s passport-free “Schengen Area” within 14 days prior to traveling to the U.S. On Saturday, officials did not explicitly say whether the U.K. and Ireland ban would be subjected to the same 30-day timeframe as the broader ban. The area in question consists of 26 countries, including France, Italy, German, Greece, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Norway, and Sweden. The Trump administration had slapped a travel ban on foreign nationals who had visited China and Iran last month. “The U.K. basically has got the border, strong borders and they're doing a very good job, they don't have much infection and hopefully they'll keep it that way,” he said when asked why the U.K. had been exempt. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is a close ally of Trump, who has in turn supported Johson's push to take Britain out of the European Union. Critics had questioned whether Britain’s exemption was politically motivated. The move also provoked anger from European leaders, who said they weren’t consulted and that the global pandemic requires “cooperation rather than unilateral action.” “The European Union disapproves of the fact that the U.S. decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation,” EU Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement. “The European Union is taking strong action to limit the spread of the virus.” In a sign of the increasing measures being taken across the country to protect the public from the coronavirus, all members of the media had their temperatures taken before the briefing -- and one journalist was turned away. Trump said he had his temperature taken as well, and also said he had been tested for the virus.

NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS DEMOCRATIC CAUCUSES: HERE ARE THE DELEGATES AT STAKE  An island chain in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, the Northern Mariana Islands is one of several U.S. territories that the Republican and Democratic parties give a say in choosing the presidential nominees, even though its citizens can't vote in presidential elections. Sanders emerged as the frontrunner in the early primary contests, but Biden soon overtook him as the primary field narrowed and the race moved to more diverse states. The former VP racked up major wins in Super Tuesday and Super Tuesday 2.0 this week. Nola Hix, chair of the U.S. territory's Democratic Party, said 134 people caucused Saturday on the Pacific island chain of about 53,000 people.

"                          Rep. Mark Green and Rep. Buddy Carter react to the White House's coronavirus response. In the past few days, we may have seen the real shape of the November general election. If this is accurate, the Democrats have a much deeper reason to be nervous than they currently imagine. There have been two vivid images of an incumbent president confronting a national crisis and a Democratic challenger issuing a dishonest commercial – which even The Washington Post denounced – while giving a widely panned speech on the coronavirus. To be fair to former Vice President Joe Biden, there was no way a speech at the Hotel du Pont was going to visually compete with an Oval Office address and a White House Rose Garden press conference. JAMES CARAFANO: TRUMP’S CORONAVIRUS NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION ALLOWS US TO ESCALATE WAR ON VIRUS There was also no way that a candidate standing by himself could compete with a president of the United States surrounded by the heads of major corporations like Walmart, CVS, Target, and others as they all pledged to work with the president to help solve a national emergency. In terms of sheer impact, nothing Biden could do could lead to the 1,900-point jump in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Callista and I were watching the press conference, and Fox News had a small box with the Dow Jones numbers going up, and up and up. It was every president’s dream of real-time validation that made a joke out of the Biden attack speech. However, Biden had two additional problems. First, the Biden campaign released an ad that so distorted President Trump’s record that The Washington Post gave it four Pinocchios. As Meg Kelly wrote in the newspaper’s Fact Checker column: “Ultimately, the seriousness of the coronavirus outbreak, the fact that Trump had clarified his comments on the matter before the ad was released, and the blatant way the Biden camp isolated his remarks about the American Dream pushed us to Four Pinocchios. Campaigns must be willing to make their case without resorting to video manipulation.” BRIT HUME WARNS BIDEN'S GAFFES SUGGEST FORMER VP 'IS LOSING HIS MEMORY AND IS GETTING SENILE' Biden’s speech got almost as negative a review as the campaign ad. As Collin Anderson wrote in the Washington Free Beacon: “Biden deployed an already-debunked Democratic talking point in Thursday remarks aimed at showcasing his own ability to lead the country through the crisis. The former vice president falsely stated that the Trump administration has cut investments in global health, a claim the Washington Post’s fact-checker rated ‘Three Pinocchios’ just days ago.” Biden said that the Trump administration slashed investment in the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-led package aimed at strengthening health initiatives abroad. This is a lie – and a sloppy one. The program is fully funded in President Trump’s proposed 2021 budget. In fact, the budget increases the program budget from $125 million to $175 million. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER So the contrast is clear. On the one hand, there is a commander in chief leading the American people in a dual-front campaign to defeat a virus and relaunch a remarkably successful economy. On the other hand, there is a tired, inaccurate, and at times dishonest candidate attacking the president on behalf of a campaign while the president is fighting on behalf of the country. The steady shrinking of former Vice President Biden will continue. Consider Marc Thiessen’s Washington Post column: “It’s fair to speculate whether Biden is mentally fit to be president."" Thiessen is not alone. On Tuesday, Fox News senior analyst, Brit Hume, said on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" that Biden could be “losing his memory and is getting senile."" Biden has a long history of putting his foot in his mouth, but Hume said Biden’s recent hiccups and mistakes on the campaign trail were beyond his normal quaint goofiness. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “‘More recently, however, he's begun to forget things,’ Hume added. ‘He didn't know what state he's in, he couldn't remember where he was when he met the Parkland [Florida] students, when he said he was in the White House. … I think that over time, the danger for him [Biden] and for his party is that he may say something that’s so outlandish and so suggestive that his cognitive faculties have failed him, that Democratic voters are going to say, ‘Oh, my Lord, what have we got here?’"" At this rate, President Trump will not be running against Joe Biden. President Trump is running against a virus and an economic slowdown. If he wins, he will grow into an even more historic figure of great accomplishment for most Americans. Meanwhile, Biden will shrink to irrelevancy and the election will be a landslide for President Trump. To read, hear, and watch more of Newt Gingrich’s commentary, visit Gingrich360.com.

Joe Biden&apos;s first ""virtual town hall"" was marred with technical gaffes and confusion, and ended after only five minutes. The former vice president had to cancel his Friday rally in Chicago over coronavirus concerns, and his campaign sought to connect with Illinois voters online instead. The event was broadcast live on Facebook and conducted with Zoom, a business videoconferencing app. It got off to a confusing start with the presidential hopeful starting his remarks before the camera started recording. As he prepared to take a phone question from ""Maureen"" the line went dead. ""You there?"" Biden asked. PRESIDENT TRUMP REVEALS HE TOOK CORONAVIRUS TEST At another point, Biden answered a question on endangered species by turning away from the camera and walking off the screen. Less than five minutes in, the town hall abruptly ended, and Biden and his aide apologized for the problems. ""I&apos;m sorry this has been such a disjointed effort here because of the connections. ... There&apos;s a lot more to say, but I&apos;ve already probably said too much to you,"" Biden said, holding a smartphone in his hand. The botched event got some tough reviews. ""Joe, you need a new technical team. They&apos;re making you look bad...,"" commented one Facebook user, Amanda Turbyfill Martin, on Biden&apos;s page. ""No level of technical team can stop someone from wandering confused out of the camera frame cause they forgot it was a live feed,"" added another user, Jake Perkins. Biden and rival Sen. Bernie Sanders have suspended large gatherings over concerns about spreading the virus as the primary race continues with a debate Sunday night and more voting Tuesday. Sanders, I-Vt., acknowledged Friday that fears about the spread of coronavirus have damaged his ability to leverage large rallies into support at the polls, and suggested that future Democratic presidential primary voting should be delayed if health officials recommend doing so. “We do more rallies than anybody else, and (they&apos;re) often very well-attended. I love to do them,"" the senator told reporters at a hotel in his home state of Vermont. “This coronavirus has obviously impacted our ability to communicate with people in the traditional way that we do. That&apos;s hurting.” Thousands of people gathering to hear him speak has defined Sanders since he first sought the White House in 2016. But the practice has been curtailed as health officials attempt to slow the virus&apos; spread. Instead, Sanders has convened the media for three straight days to blast the Trump administration over its handling of the pandemic, warning of dire impacts on the economy and human health. Despite trailing Biden in the delegate race, Sanders has given no indication he&apos;ll drop out.

"                          The coronavirus is causing major adjustments to the Democratic presidential contest for former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy reports. WASHINGTON — As the two remaining Democratic presidential candidates return to the debate stage, their party, the stakes, and the world look much different than in their last meeting less than three weeks ago. The fast-moving coronavirus was something of an afterthought in that debate; now the escalating crisis is likely to dominate Sunday’s contest. Rising infections in the United States and around the world have prompted a dramatic slowdown of global travel, upended financial markets, and raised questions about President Donald Trump’s ability to lead the nation through a prolonged period of uncertainty. Just two Democrats — former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders — remain to make the case that they are best-positioned to challenge Trump in November. Five other candidates who joined them on stage in the Feb. 25 debate in South Carolina have dropped out, with many rallying behind Biden’s surging candidacy. GEORGIA POSTPONES PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARIES OVER CORONAVIRUS FEARS For both Biden and Sanders, the debate is a moment to display their leadership skills in front of what could be one of the largest audiences of the primary. They’ll aim to draw a contrast with Trump, but also with each other, arguing that they have the right experience, temperament and policy prescriptions to lead the nation through a crisis. “Moments like these don’t come around often in campaigns and this is a perfect opportunity to show millions that you have what it takes,” said Robert Gibbs, former White House press secretary and campaign adviser to President Barack Obama. “They must show voters they are the answer to what is missing right now by being calm, honest, ready to lead and empathetic.” ""This is a perfect opportunity to show millions that you have what it takes."" The coronavirus crisis rapidly upended plans for Sunday’s debate. First, the Democratic National Committee announced that it would hold the contest without a live audience. Then the debate was moved from a large venue in Arizona, one of the states holding a primary Tuesday, to a television studio in Washington because of concerns about cross-country travel. One of the moderators had to withdraw because of potential exposure to a person who tested positive for coronavirus. It is Biden who will step on stage as the front-runner, a distinction that seemed unlikely just a few weeks ago. After disappointing showings in the early contests, Biden roared back with a commanding victory in South Carolina and has continued to rack up wins across the country, winning broad and diverse coalitions of voters. Moderate Democratic leaders, including former rivals Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, have rallied behind his candidacy and voters have done the same. Advisers say Biden will aim in Sunday&apos;s debate to show voters who backed Sanders or other liberal candidates that they have a home in his campaign. In one overture to liberals, Biden announced his support for a bankruptcy plan championed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who ended her campaign earlier this month and has yet to endorse. In a virtual town hall on Friday, Biden said his support for Warren&apos;s proposal, which aims to simplify the bankruptcy process, is ""one of the things that I think Bernie and I will agree on."" Biden holds a solid lead over Sanders in the all-important delegate race, and a strong showing in Tuesday’s primary contests could effectively guarantee his nomination. Four big states will be up for grabs: Illinois, Ohio, Arizona and Florida, a perennial general election battleground where Biden appears to have an edge over Sanders. After a strong start, the race has moved rapidly away from Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist with a loyal following among young voters and liberals. But he’s failed to expand his appeal, particularly among black voters, and his calls for a sweeping political and economic revolution have also fallen flat with suburban voters. Sanders is facing some pressure from within the Democratic Party to step aside and allow Biden take Trump on one-on-one. Several Democratic groups that were waiting to endorse until after the primary have consolidated around Biden, including super PAC Priorities USA. Sanders’ advisers say he is a realist about his current standing and the difficulty of the path ahead. Yet the senator is pledging to grill Biden in Sunday’s debate on his plans for tackling college debt, for his past support of the Iraq war and for his backing of multilateral trade agreements. “I’m going to ask Joe Biden, I mean Joe is part of the establishment for a very long time, ‘Joe, what role have you played in trying to make sure that we end this massive level of income and wealth inequality where three people own more wealth than the bottom half of America?"" Sanders said Saturday during an online “fireside chat” with supporters. Yet it’s unclear if the issues Sanders is aiming to highlight will resonate with voters at a time when much of the nation’s focus has shifted to the growing toll of the coronavirus and put a spotlight on the need for presidential leadership. Schools and businesses across the country are closed, and many hospitals and clinics are struggling to obtain tests for the coronavirus. For Biden, the outbreak of a global pandemic has been a moment to bolster the central argument of his candidacy: that his eight years as vice president give him the experience, as well as the relationships in Washington and around the world, that are needed in the Oval Office during turbulent times. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE With campaign rallies halted because of warnings against large gatherings, Biden delivered a speech in front of reporters and advisers on his proposal for combating coronavirus, including guaranteeing free testing. Sanders’ later announced his own speech, which focused largely on advocating for his call to overhaul the nation’s health insurance system and replace it with a Medicare for All program. After Sunday’s debate, it’s unclear where the candidates and the campaign go from here. Neither Biden or Sanders has announced any public rallies for next week or given any indication of when they may be able to appear in person for voters again.

The Judiciary Committee announced on Friday that Jordan had taken over the position from Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., who was required, according to GOP conference rules, to step down as he pursues a Senate bid. At the beginning of February, the House GOP Steering Committee approved Jordan&apos;s new position in a ""totally unified decision all around,"" House GOP Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., reportedly said. Rep.

TRUMP ALLIES JORDAN, MEADOWS SELECTED FOR TOP HOUSE GOP COMMITTEE ROLES The Judiciary Committee was an integral part of Congress&apos; attempts to investigate President Trump on several issues, including his July 25 phone call with the president of Ukraine. That incident led to an impeachment inquiry and ultimately, an acquittal in the U.S. Senate. Democrats have already indicated that they&apos;ll continue the Russia investigation in Congress as well as revisit impeachment, despite the Senate&apos;s acquittal.

"                          President Donald Trump and coronavirus task force team give updates on the disease in a White House briefing. The Trump administration will extend its European travel ban to include the U.K. and Ireland as part of continuing efforts to combat the coronavirus pandemic, President Trump said Saturday, before saying he was also looking at the possibility of domestic travel restrictions as well. “We are looking at it very seriously, yeah, because they’ve had a little bit of activity unfortunately,” he said when asked in the White House briefing room about reports that the European travel ban would be extended. “So we’re going to be looking at that -- we actually already have looked at it and that is going to be announced.” Asked if he was considering any domestic travel restrictions, Trump said: ""Yes, specifically from certain areas, yes we are."" ""We&apos;re working with the states and we&apos;re considering other restrictions, yes,"" he said. Vice President Mike Pence confirmed later in the briefing that the travel from U.K. and Ireland would be suspended as of midnight Monday night EDT. He said it was after the unanimous recommendation from health experts at the White House. EUROPEAN UNION LASHES OUT AT TRUMP OVER TRAVEL BAN AMID CORONAVIRUS CHAOS Pence emphasized that Americans currently abroad will be allowed to return home, but will be tested for the virus on their return through certain, limited airports. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said that it specifically applies to foreign nationals who have been in the U.K. or Ireland in the last 14 days and that it does not apply to U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents and foreign diplomats. It also does not apply to cargo. Wolf also said that major cruise lines have agreed to suspend outbound trips for 30 days, that smaller lines had followed suit, and that in some limited cases the government had given orders to ""a small handful"" to not sail. Those restrictions began late Friday, he said. As for whether the administration is considering travel restrictions within the U.S., Pence referred back to Trump&apos;s remarks and said ""we&apos;re considering a broad range of measures, but no decisions have been made yet."" Trump announced late Wednesday that travel from Europe would be restricted for 30 days -- but he initially exempted the U.K. and Ireland. The Department of Homeland Security went on to clarify that the ban affects most foreign nationals who were in Europe’s passport-free “Schengen Area” within 14 days prior to traveling to the U.S. On Saturday, officials did not explicitly say whether the U.K. and Ireland ban would be subjected to the same 30-day timeframe as the broader ban. The area in question consists of 26 countries, including France, Italy, German, Greece, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Norway, and Sweden. The Trump administration had slapped a travel ban on foreign nationals who had visited China and Iran last month. “The U.K. basically has got the border, strong borders and they&apos;re doing a very good job, they don&apos;t have much infection and hopefully they&apos;ll keep it that way,” he said when asked why the U.K. had been exempt. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is a close ally of Trump, who has in turn supported Johson&apos;s push to take Britain out of the European Union. Critics had questioned whether Britain’s exemption was politically motivated. The move also provoked anger from European leaders, who said they weren’t consulted and that the global pandemic requires “cooperation rather than unilateral action.” “The European Union disapproves of the fact that the U.S. decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation,” EU Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement. “The European Union is taking strong action to limit the spread of the virus.” In a sign of the increasing measures being taken across the country to protect the public from the coronavirus, all members of the media had their temperatures taken before the briefing -- and one journalist was turned away. Trump said he had his temperature taken as well, and also said he had been tested for the virus.

On the entertainment side of the business, TMZ reports that “Jeopardy!” and “Wheel of Fortune” have decided to tape their shows without a live studio audience. One reported concern is the weakened immune system of “Jeopardy!” host Alex Trebek, who is battling Stage 4 cancer. It’s hard to be in journalism without personal contact with people–whether it’s covering rallies or debates, flying on Air Force One, or getting out and interviewing people--but we all need to rethink our daily routines. And what about the party conventions in July and August? Will they come off as planned if the virus is spreading at anything like the rate it is today? Will many of the 15,000 journalists who generally attend decide to pass up Milwaukee and Charlotte? There are more subtle effects as well. It’s one thing to be reporting and writing about coronavirus in China, Italy, or the Seattle suburbs. It’s another thing when people you actually know are contracting the virus, and adds to the sense that the disease is dangerously spreading. And this comes at a time when the news business is under fire—by critics ranging from Trump to Dr. Drew—for unnecessarily scaring people about the magnitude of the threat. (The press, in turn, regularly lambastes Trump for underplaying the situation.) Some bomb-throwers like CNBC commentator Rick Santelli aren’t helping. He called for everyone in America to be infected with the virus to get it over with. “It was just a stupid thing to say,” he later admitted on “Squawk Box.” “The idea of something so absurd — I just apologize, and I apologize to everyone on this segment and all my peers at CNBC. We will get through this. We are resilient. But even if one life is affected, I do apologize for my insensitivity.”  SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE&apos;S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY&apos;S HOTTEST STORIES White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham is demanding that Vanity Fair retract a report that Trump has told aides he’s afraid that journalists will try to contract the coronavirus and give it to him on Air Force One. “False and sensational writing on this topic is irresponsible,” she said. The broader dilemma, in my view, is not so much the tone of the coverage as the relentless volume of it. There are so many angles to this global story, including the stock market plunge that culminated Monday with the largest drop since the 2008 financial crisis. Harvard kicks students out of the dorms and moves to online classes. Boston cancels its St. Patrick’s Day parade. South by Southwest is canceled. Pearl Jam cancels its concerts. Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders camce; rallies in Cleveland. New York and Florida declare states of emergency. Andrew Cuomo deploys the National Guard to a “containment zone” in a New York City suburb. There is talk of the NCAA tournament, and even the NBA, playing without fans (which LeBron James says he would boycott). And every new case, or handful of cases, gets breaking-news treatment. These and many other stories are significant and have to be covered. What’s more, there is clearly a huge public appetite for news about the virus (not to mention a thriving market of disinformation on social media, as the NYT reports). That’s why the subject is dominating cable news and the top of home pages of major newspapers. In that sense, news executives can be described as giving the public what it wants. But with America on edge, with emotions so raw, with the crisis so politicized, journalists need to think long and hard about whether their they are even inadvertently sowing the seeds of panic.

"                          Rep. Mark Green and Rep. Buddy Carter react to the White House's coronavirus response. In the past few days, we may have seen the real shape of the November general election. If this is accurate, the Democrats have a much deeper reason to be nervous than they currently imagine. There have been two vivid images of an incumbent president confronting a national crisis and a Democratic challenger issuing a dishonest commercial – which even The Washington Post denounced – while giving a widely panned speech on the coronavirus. To be fair to former Vice President Joe Biden, there was no way a speech at the Hotel du Pont was going to visually compete with an Oval Office address and a White House Rose Garden press conference. JAMES CARAFANO: TRUMP’S CORONAVIRUS NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION ALLOWS US TO ESCALATE WAR ON VIRUS There was also no way that a candidate standing by himself could compete with a president of the United States surrounded by the heads of major corporations like Walmart, CVS, Target, and others as they all pledged to work with the president to help solve a national emergency. In terms of sheer impact, nothing Biden could do could lead to the 1,900-point jump in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Callista and I were watching the press conference, and Fox News had a small box with the Dow Jones numbers going up, and up and up. It was every president’s dream of real-time validation that made a joke out of the Biden attack speech. However, Biden had two additional problems. First, the Biden campaign released an ad that so distorted President Trump’s record that The Washington Post gave it four Pinocchios. As Meg Kelly wrote in the newspaper’s Fact Checker column: “Ultimately, the seriousness of the coronavirus outbreak, the fact that Trump had clarified his comments on the matter before the ad was released, and the blatant way the Biden camp isolated his remarks about the American Dream pushed us to Four Pinocchios. Campaigns must be willing to make their case without resorting to video manipulation.” BRIT HUME WARNS BIDEN&apos;S GAFFES SUGGEST FORMER VP &apos;IS LOSING HIS MEMORY AND IS GETTING SENILE&apos; Biden’s speech got almost as negative a review as the campaign ad. As Collin Anderson wrote in the Washington Free Beacon: “Biden deployed an already-debunked Democratic talking point in Thursday remarks aimed at showcasing his own ability to lead the country through the crisis. The former vice president falsely stated that the Trump administration has cut investments in global health, a claim the Washington Post’s fact-checker rated ‘Three Pinocchios’ just days ago.” Biden said that the Trump administration slashed investment in the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-led package aimed at strengthening health initiatives abroad. This is a lie – and a sloppy one. The program is fully funded in President Trump’s proposed 2021 budget. In fact, the budget increases the program budget from $125 million to $175 million. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER So the contrast is clear. On the one hand, there is a commander in chief leading the American people in a dual-front campaign to defeat a virus and relaunch a remarkably successful economy. On the other hand, there is a tired, inaccurate, and at times dishonest candidate attacking the president on behalf of a campaign while the president is fighting on behalf of the country. The steady shrinking of former Vice President Biden will continue. Consider Marc Thiessen’s Washington Post column: “It’s fair to speculate whether Biden is mentally fit to be president."" Thiessen is not alone. On Tuesday, Fox News senior analyst, Brit Hume, said on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" that Biden could be “losing his memory and is getting senile."" Biden has a long history of putting his foot in his mouth, but Hume said Biden’s recent hiccups and mistakes on the campaign trail were beyond his normal quaint goofiness. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “‘More recently, however, he&apos;s begun to forget things,’ Hume added. ‘He didn&apos;t know what state he&apos;s in, he couldn&apos;t remember where he was when he met the Parkland [Florida] students, when he said he was in the White House. … I think that over time, the danger for him [Biden] and for his party is that he may say something that’s so outlandish and so suggestive that his cognitive faculties have failed him, that Democratic voters are going to say, ‘Oh, my Lord, what have we got here?’"" At this rate, President Trump will not be running against Joe Biden. President Trump is running against a virus and an economic slowdown. If he wins, he will grow into an even more historic figure of great accomplishment for most Americans. Meanwhile, Biden will shrink to irrelevancy and the election will be a landslide for President Trump. To read, hear, and watch more of Newt Gingrich’s commentary, visit Gingrich360.com.

"                          Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Louisiana is moving to postpone its April 4 presidential primary due to concerns over the coronavirus outbreak, state election officials announced Friday. The primary – which includes mayoral races and local propositions as well as the presidential ballot – would instead be held June 20, Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin announced at a news conference in Baton Rouge. Christina Stephens, a spokeswoman for Louisiana Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards, told Fox News the governor will sign an executive order Friday moving the election to the later date. The governor is also planning to hold a press conference in New Orleans on Friday. TRUMP TO ANNOUNCE NATIONAL EMERGENCY ON CORONAVIRUS: HERE'S WHAT THAT MEANS “The governor and the secretary of state began this discussion of delaying the primary several days ago out of concern for the aging population of poll workers and a desire to prevent the spread of illness,” Stephens said. “We are experiencing community spread of coronavirus in Louisiana and the governor is taking decisive action to slow its progress.” Louisiana is the first state that’s holding an upcoming primary or caucus to move to delay their contest.       Christina Stephens, a spokeswoman for Louisiana Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards (pictured), told Fox News the governor will sign an executive order Friday moving the election to the later date. The governor is also planning to hold a press conference in New Orleans on Friday. (AP Photo/Melinda Deslatte, File)       ""Today I have certified that a state of emergency exists and requested that the governor issue an executive order postponing the elections this spring. We have requested postponing the April 4 primary election until June 20 and postponing the May 9 general election until July 25,"" Ardoin, the secretary of state, said. ""While hurricanes, floods and tornadoes are at the forefront of all Louisianan's minds, the threat we face from the COV-19 virus is an unprecedented threat and unlike any we have faced,"" the secretary of state added. ""Safe and secure elections also mean safety to the people of Louisiana,"" he emphasized. Four states hold primaries on Tuesday – Arizona, Florida, Illinois, and Ohio. Meanwhile, Arizona's Secretary of State's office told Fox News it couldn't move the date of their primary because it would require legislative action. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP That comes as election officials in the four states are making last-minute moves -- such as moving polling places away from locations with heavy concentrations of high-risk people, like nursing homes. The secretary of states of Arizona, Florida, Illinois, and Ohio put out a joint statement emphasizing that “we are working closely with our state health officials to ensure that our poll workers and voters can be confident that voting is safe.” “Unlike concerts, sporting events or other mass gatherings where large groups of people travel long distances to congregate in a confined space for an extended period of time, polling locations see people from a nearby community coming into and out of the building for a short duration,” they noted.  And the secretary of states highlighted that “guidance from voting machine manufacturers on how best to sanitize machines, guidance from CDC on best practices for hand washing, and guidance from our respective state health officials is being provided to every polling location.” Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders - asked about the postponement of Louisiana's primary - told reporters at a press conference in his hometown of Burlington, Vermont that ""elections are the bedrock of our democracy and we don’t want to be delaying elections on a willy nilly basis."" But he stressed that ""there is obviously a growing concern about bringing people together and spreading the virus…. I don’t think there’s anybody out there – no matter what your political view may be – that wants to see people become infected because they are voting.""  Former Vice President Joe Biden’s campaign put out a statement following the move by Louisiana. “Voting is at the very heart of who we are as a democracy. As election officials working with public health officials are demonstrating throughout the country, our elections can be conducted safely in consultation with public health officials,” deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said. “If voters are feeling healthy, not exhibiting symptoms, and don’t believe they've been exposed to COVID-19, please vote on Tuesday,"" Bedingfield said of the upcoming contests. ""If voters are members of an at-risk population, exhibiting symptoms, or have been exposed to a diagnosed case of COVID-19, we encourage them to explore absentee ballots and vote by mail options.”    ",         Louisiana moves to postpone primary amid coronavirus pandemic,         2020-03-13T130433-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/louisiana-postpones-primary-amid-coronavirus-pandemic,Fox
"                          Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin joins Chris Wallace on 'Fox News Sunday.' Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Sunday that the Trump administration is not asking Congress for bailouts when it pushes for money to help protect certain American businesses disproportionately affected by the coronavirus pandemic as he sought to calm fears surrounding the volatile stock market and the effect of the coronavirus on the economy. Speaking on ""Fox News Sunday"" with Chris Wallace, Mnuchin said that he and President Trump are hoping for ""a big stimulus program because we need to help American workers now."" He specifically mentioned businesses like airlines and cruise lines within the travel industry as possible targets for stimulus funds, but told Wallace the administration does not want a bailout.

GOP SENATOR PUSHING LEGISLATION TO REDUCE PHARMACEUTICAL DEPENDENCY ON CHINA: 'WE ARE DEPENDENT ON THEM' Mnuchin said the administration's efforts will focus more on individuals than corporations. ""To the extent that we need to support different businesses that are impacted, again our focus is going to be on stimulus for the workers and getting money to the workers that are impacted,"" he said. Early Saturday morning the House of Representatives passed a coronavirus relief bill, which Mnuchin was heavily involved in negotiating and received the backing of President Trump. According to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the bill includes paid emergency leave with two weeks of paid sick leave and up to three months of paid family and medical leave. “We have also secured enhanced unemployment insurance, a step that will extend protections to furloughed workers,” she said. Pelosi also said the bill included food security measures and increased federal funds for Medicaid. Mnuchin said the Trump administration is working with the Senate to shepherd the bill through for the president's signature. ""I'm speaking to senators, I don't wanna predict, I think there's a lot of bipartisan support, I hope they pass this bill,"" Mnuchin said. If the bill cannot make it through the Senate, he said he will work to come up with a compromise bill between the GOP-controlled Senate and the Democrat-controlled House. ""Whatever we need, we are gonna get from Congress,"" he said. Also in his interview with Wallace on Sunday, Mnuchin went out of his way to ease investors' fears after a week that saw trading stopped on two separate occasions because of sharp sell-offs and the worst day for the market since 1987. Mnuchin said the drop in the market was related to the coronavirus fears. He said he was optimistic about the U.S. government's ability to stop the spread of the disease, which would eventually lead to the market getting back on track.

""People who brought stocks after the crash in [1987], people who bought stocks after the financial crisis [in 2008] did really well.

"                          Coronavirus task force member Dr. Anthony Fauci, director National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, joins Chris Wallace on 'Fox News Sunday.' Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, expressed dismay over recent scenes of Americans fleeing Europe en masse, creating significant crowds at airports during a time when people are encouraged to engage in social separation to avoid spreading coronavirus. Fauci made clear that the recent travel ban from Europe does not apply to Americans, and that people do not need to rush back to the U.S. all at once. CORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN “What people need to understand, if you’re an American citizen if you are a family member, that you can get back,"" he told ""Fox News Sunday,"" making clear that people do not need to return to the U.S. immediately. ""But it’s understandable when people see a travel ban they immediately want to hunker and get home. Hopefully we won’t see more of that but I think we probably unfortunately will see that.” During an appearance Sunday on CNN, Fauci did not rule out his support for a temporary national lockdown of restaurants and bars. He said said he'd ""like to see a dramatic diminution of the personal interaction that we see"" in social gathering spots. ""Whatever it takes to do that, that's what I'd like to see,"" Fauci told Brianna Keilar on ""State of the Union."" Fauci told Wallace that he did not think a national lockdown, similar to Italy's, would be necessary for the United States, and also discussed three reasons why coronavirus is different from other ailments like the flu. “One, it’s brand new so we don’t have any prior experience about what it’s gonna do, what it’s dynamic’s gonna be,” he said. “Number 2, it spreads very easily, there’s no doubt about that. It isn’t like some of the other outbreaks that we had that just didn’t adapt itself to spread among humans. And Number 3, it’s very serious in the sense of morbidity and mortality, particularly among – and very heavily weighted -- towards individuals who are more susceptible – the elderly and those with underlying conditions.” When asked if its contagiousness and lethality are worse than the flu, Fauci emphatically said, “Well yes, I mean it just is, and we’ve gotta face that fact.” Fauci also repeated his prediction that things “will get worse before they get better.” He remained optimistic that the impact can be mitigated, but only if people take precautions. “To think that right now everything is going to be okay if we don’t do anything, that’s absolutely incorrect,” he said. Fauci also said that a national lockdown like what has taken place in Italy will likely not be necessary in the U.S. ""We feel that with rather stringent mitigation and containment without necessarily complete lockdown we’d be able to prevent ourselves from getting to where, unfortunately, Italy is now,"" he said. Fauci also noted that domestic travel bans have “not been seriously considered.” CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP One issue that Americans have faced is the difficulty in getting tested. Fauci did not pull any punches during a House Oversight Committee hearing Thursday, in which he acknowledged the government’s “failing” when it comes to being equipped for large-scale testing, but Friday told Fox News there will be a “major escalation” now that the private sector is getting involved. He reiterated that optimism on Sunday, saying that with the involvement of private companies, in the next week it appears that even if some Americans are still not able to get tested, “the totality of the picture is going to be infinitely better than it was a few weeks ago.”    ",         Dr. Fauci explains why coronavirus is worse than flu,         2020-03-15T102231-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/fauci-explains-why-coronavirus-is-worse-than-flu-warns-against-americans-fleeing-europe-immediately,Fox
"                          Former federal inmate turned life coach Enrique Fiallo weighs in on what awaits former Trump attorney Michael Cohen in the big house. President Trump’s former personal attorney Michael Cohen has shared a petition calling for the president to have the Federal Bureau of Prisons allow prisoners like him to be released and placed under home detention during the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. The petition specifically calls for federal non-violent offenders – like Cohen -- to be sent home to free up prison resources. GOP REPS MAKE CASE FOR NEW CHARGES AGAINST EX-TRUMP LAWYER MICHAEL COHEN “The Federal Prison Camps are without adequate medical staff and are without proper medical equipment, sterilization techniques, gloves, sanitizers, masks, and other necessary items,” the petition says. It claims that placing non-violent offenders under home confinement “would give the prison facilities additional (and much needed) medical triage and logistic space for those who will become infected with the COVID-19 Virus, the spread of which is discussed as a mathematical certitude.” The greater availability of prison resources is necessary, the petition claims, because of the burdens already faced by hospitals and complications involved in transporting sick prisoners. Cohen is currently serving a three-year sentence following a 2018 guilty plea to charges including bank and tax fraud, as well as campaign finance violations related to Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. He began serving his sentence at federal facility in Otisville, N.Y., in May 2019. Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee, said in January that he wants  Cohen to face the possibility of more criminal charges for allegedly lying to Congress.

"                          A look at what's in&nbsp;Bernie Sanders' coronavirus plan Sen. Bernie Sanders seemed to suggest Sunday that this week’s Democratic presidential primaries should be postponed for safety reasons amid the rapidly spreading coronavirus outbreak. In a post-debate interview on CNN, Sanders, I-Vt., pointed to new guidelines released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention limiting gatherings to no more than 50 people over the next eight weeks as the country grapples with the highly contagious COVID-19. LOUISIANA POSTPONES PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY AMID COVID-19 PANDEMIC “I would hope that governors listen to the public health experts and what they are saying is … we don’t want gatherings of more than 50 people,” Sanders said late Sunday when asked about Tuesday's contests. “I’m thinking about some of the elderly people sitting behind the desks, registering people and doing all that stuff. Does that make sense? I’m not sure it does.” The next round of contests is scheduled Tuesday in Arizona, Illinois, Florida and Ohio. While some states are either considering postponing primaries or have already decided to do so, officials responsible for this week's contests have shown little inclination to delay -- instead stressing safety precautions in place. ""[W]e are working closely with our state health officials to ensure that our poll workers and voters can be confident that voting is safe,"" secretaries of state for those elections said in a recent statement. Based on the latest polling data, Sanders could be in for a tough night of primaries should the vote go forward as planned. According to the RealClearPolitics average for the Florida primary, Sanders is trailing former Vice President Joe Biden badly — with 22.6 percent of Floridians supporting the self-described democratic socialist to Biden’s 65.4 percent. The RealClearPolitics average shows Biden also leading with 49 percent of the vote in Arizona, to Sanders’ 27.3 percent. Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield, during a call with reporters Sunday night after the CNN/Univision-hosted debate, was asked about Sanders’ comments but wouldn’t weigh in on whether Tuesday’s contests should be postponed.

The back-and-forth over whether Tuesday’s contests will take place comes after Louisiana moved to postpone their primary, originally scheduled for April 4. That contest has been postponed to June 20, amid concerns of the spread of COVID-19. Georgia followed suit, over the weekend announcing that the state’s March 24 primary would be postponed to May 19. COVID-19 was designated by the World Health Organization as a global pandemic last week. President Trump announced a national emergency on Friday. The president also announced a temporary halt on air travel to the United States from Europe, now including flights from the United Kingdom, but excluding those carrying cargo. The announcement came as major sporting and other events were called off or postponed, businesses across the country instituted telework policies, government buildings and schools shuttered and other disruptions rocked the nation, amid efforts to curb the transmission of the virus. The Federal Reserve also slashed interest rates to near zero and said it would buy $700 billion in Treasury securities in an aggressive step to insulate the U.S. economy from the pandemic. The outbreak is believed to have originated at an animal and seafood market in the city of Wuhan, China. As of Monday morning, there were more than 3,700 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States, in 49 states, including Washington, D.C. The U.S., so far, has seen 68 coronavirus-related deaths. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to WHO, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.

"                          NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio addresses coronavirus response, gives updates. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is arguing that the best way to tackle the coronavirus outbreak is for the federal government to take over critical private companies in the medical field and have them running 24 hours a day. The mayor, who made multiple media appearances over the weekend, said that the current situation calls for drastic measures which include nationalizing certain industries. CORONAVIRUS HAS NEW YORKERS WAKING UP IN A CITY THAT NEVER SLEEPS TO BIG CHANGES  “This is a case for a nationalization, literally a nationalization, of crucial factories and industries that could produce the medical supplies to prepare this country for what we need,” de Blasio told MSNBC’s Joy Reid on Saturday, calling for “24/7 shifts” during what he called a “war-like situation.” The following day, de Blasio reiterated this message, telling CNN that “the federal government needs to take over the supply chain right now.” He specified the need for companies that make ventilators, surgical masks, and hand sanitizers to be taken over and made to work around the clock. CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE New York state already has started producing hand sanitizer in response to shortages and price gouging. The city itself has also taken drastic steps to deal with the crisis, forcing restaurants to limit themselves to takeout and delivery service, and closing many establishments to prevent the spread of the virus through crowds. The mayor predicted that coronavirus will continue to be a problem “for at least six months.” CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Sunday evening, it was announced that New York City schools will be shutting down until at least April 20, a measure de Blasio previously had resisted, despite facing pressure to do so.

"                          Sidney Powell, attorney for Gen. Michael Flynn, speaks out on 'Hannity.' The attorney for former national security adviser Michael Flynn on Monday welcomed President Trump’s apparent consideration of a pardon for her client, calling the case against him a “blight” on the justice system. The president on Sunday said he was “strongly considering” a ""full pardon"" for Flynn – whose case stemmed from the Russia probe – complaining the FBI “lost” records related to Flynn’s initial interview with federal investigators. TRUMP 'STRONGLY CONSIDERING' PARDON FOR MICHAEL FLYNN In an email to Fox News on Monday, attorney Sidney Powell expressed her team's gratitude over the president’s consideration. “General Flynn is honored by the President’s concern and awareness of this egregious injustice against him, his family, and the American people,” Powell wrote to Fox News. “Mueller-Weissman team and evil actors in the FBI and [the Department of Justice, DOJ] had to concoct case against Flynn to keep their obstruction hoax alive against the president. That’s what it was really about.” Robert Mueller served as special counsel leading the Russia probe, and Andrew Weissmann was a top member of the team. Flynn had pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI as part of that probe, and his sentencing remains in limbo. Powell went on to say that “Flynn was the tip of the spear to destroy Trump.” “This persecution is an outrage and a blight on the entire justice system,” she continued. “No one can have any trust in the FBI or DOJ until this is corrected. The first step in restoring public confidence and trust in the FBI and DOJ is giving us the truth and dismissing the prosecution of Flynn for outrageous government misconduct.” Powell has been aggressively fighting the DOJ in the case, filing a motion on Flynn’s behalf in January alleging problems that have come to light since Flynn pleaded guilty. The motion stated that there is no precise record of Flynn’s statements to agents, and that the original handwritten ""302"" witness report from the interview is “missing,” with subsequent versions later “edited.” “So now it is reported that, after destroying his life & the life of his wonderful family (and many others also), the FBI, working in conjunction with the Justice Department, has ‘lost’ the record of General Michael Flynn,” Trump tweeted Sunday. “How convenient. I am strongly considering a Full Pardon!” Flynn’s case stemmed from a January 2017 FBI interview, in which he was asked about his conversations with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements regarding those communications during his interview, as part of Mueller’s investigation, but has since reversed course. In January, Flynn and Powell moved to withdraw his guilty plea for making false statements “because of the government’s bad faith, vindictiveness and breach of the plea agreement.” DOJ TAPS OUTSIDE PROSECUTOR TO REVIEW HANDLING OF MICHAEL FLYNN CASE “The prosecution has shown abject bad faith in pure retaliation against Mr. Flynn since he retained new counsel,” Powell wrote in January. “This can only be because, with new, unconflicted counsel, Mr. Flynn refused to lie for the prosecution.” ""Michael T. Flynn is innocent. Mr. Flynn has cooperated with the government in good faith for two years. He gave the prosecution his full cooperation,"" the attorneys added. At the time, the DOJ had accused Flynn of failing to cooperate and of failing to take responsibility. “The defendant’s conduct was more than just a series of lies; it was an abuse of trust,” the DOJ wrote. But after Flynn attempted to withdraw his plea, the Justice Department offered a more lenient sentence recommendation. Federal prosecutors still seek a sentence of up to six months, but unlike before, prosecutors explicitly state that probation would be a “reasonable” punishment and that they would not oppose it. Last month, U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan ordered Flynn's sentencing hearing canceled ""until further order of the court,"" giving Flynn and federal prosecutors more time to submit filings on Flynn's request to withdraw his guilty plea, including claims he did not get sufficient legal assistance from his former legal team. Also last month, Attorney General Bill Barr tapped Jeff Jensen, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri, to review Flynn’s case. Jensen is working hand-in-hand with the lead prosecutor of Flynn’s case, an official said. The case against Flynn, a former U.S. Army lieutenant general, has gone through years of twists and turns, with sentencing postponed repeatedly over the last two years. Flynn’s supporters have insisted he is innocent.

The Supreme Court announced Monday that it will postpone oral arguments for the March session due to concerns over the coronavirus outbreak -- marking the first health crisis-related delay for such proceedings since the Spanish flu a century ago. Those arguments include cases scheduled to before the court on March 23-25 and March 30-April 1. A press release says the justices will hold their regular conference on Friday and issue their Order List on Monday, though the release says ""Some Justices may participate remotely by telephone."" The Supreme Court building was already closed to the public last week, and it will remain open for business even as the oral arguments -- which see the justices, several of whom are senior citizens, packed in the courtroom with hundreds of lawyers, activists, members of parties and journalists -- are postponed. Filing deadlines will also not be extended, according to the Supreme Court's news release. According to the court's news release, the last time the Supreme Court postponed oral arguments due to a health crisis was 1918 as the Spanish flu, which sickened U.S. President Woodrow Wilson at the time, afflicted the United States.

"                          'This is where America shines,' says Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine and professor at Baylor College of Medicine. How concerned are you about the coronavirus outbreak? The answer may depend on whether you’re a Democrat or Republican, a new national poll suggests. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey released Sunday found that just over half of Americans are worried that a family member may catch the virus that causes COVID-19, and that six in 10 say the worst is yet to come regarding the pandemic. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW But the poll – which was conducted almost entirely before President Trump declared a national emergency on Friday – points to a wide partisan divide on attitudes regarding the outbreak. Sixty-eight percent of Democrats said they were concerned that a family member could contract the virus. But that number dropped to 40 percent among Republicans. Nearly eight in 10 Democrats felt the worst was yet to come in coping with the pandemic. That number dropped in half to 40 percent among Republicans.  Six in 10 Democrats said they’ve stopped or plan to stop going to any large gatherings. That percentage dropped in half for Republicans. And 47 percent of Democrats but just 23 percent of Republicans said they were canceling or rescheduling travel plans. Spotlighting the gravity of the situation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Sunday recommended against holding gatherings of 50 people or more for the next eight weeks. The president, at a Sunday news conference, told Americans to “relax” and said “we’re doing great, it will all pass” as he urged shoppers not to hoard supplies and food at stories. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE CORONVIRUS OUTBREAK According to the poll, 45 percent of Americans gave the president a thumbs up for how he’s handling the coronavirus outbreak. But there’s a gigantic partisan divide. Eighty-one percent of Republicans but just 13 percent of Democrats approved of the job he’s doing battling the virus, with independents at 43 percent. The NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll was conducted March 11-13 (Wednesday-Friday), with 900 registered voters nationwide questioned by live telephone operators.

"                          Reaction from liberal analyst Cathy Areu and Republican strategist Ash Wright. Former Vice President Joe Biden for months has touted his more moderate positions over the more radical platform of rival Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. — but he's taken a noticeable left turn on a number of issues as he courts Sanders' progressive base and tries to lock down the nomination. Biden has even gone so far as to state he was adopting parts of plans offered by Sanders himself, as well as former presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Here's a look at the front-running Democratic primary candidate's evolving platform: MARY ANNE MARSH: IN BIDEN-SANDERS DEBATE, SOLUTIONS WIN AND REVOLUTION LOSES Free College A key feature of Sanders’ platform has been his desire to offer free college for everyone. Biden now says he’s a fan, but placed a limit on his proposal that Sanders opposes. “Bernie has put forward a plan that would make public colleges and universities free for families whose income is below $125,000. It's a good idea, and after consideration, I am proud to add it to my platform,” Biden tweeted Sunday. Sanders’ campaign noted in response that the democratic socialist’s plan does not have any income-based restrictions and calls for tuition-free college for all. “It's great that Joe Biden is now supporting a position that was in the Democratic platform four years ago,"" Sanders' team said in a statement. ""Now, we have to go much further. We need to make all public universities, colleges and trade schools tuition-free for everyone like our high schools are."" Bankruptcy In the same Twitter thread, Biden announced that he is also supporting Warren’s bankruptcy plan, which aims to simplify the bankruptcy process. “Few people in the country understand how bankruptcy hurts working families more than Elizabeth Warren,"" Biden said. ""Today, I am fully endorsing and adopting her bankruptcy plan, which she called 'Fixing Our Bankruptcy System to Give People a Second Chance.'"" Warren, in a Medium post earlier this year, said her plan would ""make it easier for people being crushed by debt to obtain relief through bankruptcy,"" ""expand people’s rights to take care of themselves and their children while they are in the bankruptcy process,"" end the ""absurd rules that make it nearly impossible to discharge student loan debt in bankruptcy,"" and ""let more people protect their homes and cars in bankruptcy so they can start from a firm foundation when they start to pick up the pieces and rebuild their financial lives."" Fracking During Sunday's debate, after Sanders discussed putting an end to all fracking, Biden responded by saying, ""No new fracking."" It was unclear at first if this was a call for a total ban on the practice going forward, but Biden's campaign later said that it was a reiteration of his previously stated position against new oil and gas drilling on federal lands. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Immigration Biden has taken a more liberal stance on illegal immigration in recent weeks, saying that if he becomes president he will impose a 100-day freeze on deportation. He also said that people who enter the U.S. illegally will not be deported unless they commit a felony on American soil, even if they have a criminal record in another country. This goes further than the policy advertised on Biden’s campaign website, which simply calls for ending “prolonged detention” as people await court hearings.

"                          Reaction from liberal analyst Cathy Areu and Republican strategist Ash Wright. Joe Biden holds a commanding lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders in Arizona, according to a new poll released on the eve of that state’s presidential primary. A Monmouth University survey released on Monday shows the former vice president with 51 percent support among likely Democratic presidential primary voters. Sanders – the populist lawmaker from Vermont who’s making his second straight White House run – stands at 31 percent.  That's 20 percentage points behind Biden. SANDERS HINTS TUESDAY'S PRIMARIES SHOULD BE POSTPONED Arizona joins Florida, Illinois and Ohio in holding Democratic nominating contests on Tuesday. As of now, officials in all four states plan to proceed with their primaries despite much of the country closing down as the coronavirus outbreak spreads. Polls in all four states indicate Biden holding double-digit leads. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii – the only other remaining candidate left in the battle for the Democratic nomination – is backed by just 1 percent. In the Biden-Sanders face-off, the poll indicates Sanders with at 48-41 percent edge among Latino voters and a large 56-28 percent lead among voters under age 50. But Biden holds a large 29-point lead among white voters and an overwhelming 48-point lead among voters age 50 and older. “Biden has a strong advantage going into the primary. This is because much of his support has already been banked in the early vote. The closure of many polling places due to COVID-19 means it is uncertain how many voters who planned to vote on Tuesday will actually show up,” Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray said in a statement. The poll suggests that just over half of likely primary voters have already cast ballots, with Biden holding a nearly two-to-one margin over Sanders among those voters. SANDERS ATTACKS BIDEN'S RECORD AS SUNDAY NIGHT'S DEBATE GETS TESTY Looking ahead to the November general election, the survey shows Biden with a slight 46-43 percent advantage over President Trump – while the Republican incumbent has a slight 44-43 percent edge over Sanders. Trump topped 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by 4 points in Arizona four years ago – and the state’s considered to be one of a handful of battleground states in the 2020 election. The Monmouth University poll was conducted March 11-14, with 847 registered voters – including 373 likely to vote in the Democratic presidential primary – questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s overall sampling error is 3.4 percentage points, with a margin of error of 5.1 percentage points for Democratic primary questions.

"                          A handful of House Democrats want U.S. attorney John Durham to step aside; reaction from Arizona Congressman Andy Biggs, Republican member of the House Judiciary Committee. U.S. Attorney John Durham is expected to wrap up his investigation into the origins of the Russia probe by the end of the summer, sources confirmed to Fox News. One source suggested the investigation could end as soon as July, while another said it could be closer to September, based on Durham's progress, which could be hindered by the coronavirus pandemic rocking the nation and the globe. TOP GOP REP SUGGESTS DURHAM PROBE WILL LEAD TO CHARGES Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, relayed the same timeline during a House Rules Committee meeting focused on reform of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act last week. “His investigation is due to be completed sometime this summer,” Jordan said. His comments were first reported by The Washington Examiner. Durham, the U.S. attorney for Connecticut, was appointed last year by Attorney General Bill Barr to review the events leading up to the 2016 presidential election and through President Trump’s January 20, 2017 inauguration. But, as Fox News first reported, Durham has since expanded his investigation to cover a post-election timeline spanning the spring of 2017—when Robert Mueller was appointed as special counsel. Last month, Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., who served as the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee but left the role after announcing a Senate campaign, told Fox News that Durham’s probe will likely lead to criminal charges. DOJ INVESTIGATES THE INVESTIGATORS: 5 INTERNAL PROBES UNDERWAY ON RUSSIA AND MORE “This is not going to be a Mueller report; there won’t be a report,” Collins told Fox News, noting that Durham and his team have kept very “quiet” about their work. “When he’s ready to charge people, he’ll charge people,” Collins told Fox News. “And that’s when we’ll know.” Collins explained that Barr had expanded Durham’s reach into the intelligence community, and added that he has “grand juries” and “everything else” at his disposal. Durham has investigated CIA officials and other officials throughout the intelligence community. Former CIA Director John Brennan has said that Durham plans to interview him and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. Those interviews have yet to take place, a source familiar with the investigation told Fox News last month.

As the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread in the United States, members of Congress and their staffs are taking precautions to ensure they do not contract the disease or spread it to others — including social distancing, testing and self-quarantine. Most recently, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., tested negative for coronavirus on Sunday after self-quarantining following a trip to President Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort — where a member of the Brazilian president's delegation spent time before later testing positive for the novel coronavirus. The veteran senator tweeted that his test was negative. ""I was just informed by [Dr. Monahan], the head of the House Physicians Office, that my coronavirus test was NEGATIVE. I am very grateful and like everyone else will follow the best practices to stay negative,"" Graham tweeted.

Two of those positive tests came Sunday night. The other was a member of Washington Sen. Maria Cantwell's staff last week. Delaware Sen. Tom Carper's office said in a press release Sunday that one member of his state staff -- meaning the person did not spend time in Washington, D.C. -- tested positive for the coronavirus and was self-quarantining. ""On the advice of Delaware public health experts at the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS), other members of Senator Carper’s staff who came in contact with the individual while the individual was exhibiting symptoms will be self-isolating at home for the next 14 days and monitoring their symptoms closely,"" the press release said. ""If any of those staff members start showing symptoms of COVID-19, they will be tested as well."" HOUSE'S CORONAVIRUS BILL MAY BE IN TROUBLE IN THE SENATE The release from Carper's office said all of his staff would begin teleworking on Monday. Arizona GOP Rep. David Schweikert announced Sunday that a member of his Capitol Hill staff tested positive. ""They are resting comfortably at home and following guidance from local health officials,"" Schweikart said in a statement Sunday. ""Given that I have interacted with the employee who tested positive, I will be working from home until otherwise told by doctors."" Schweikart is also closing both his Capitol Hill office and his office in Scottsdale, Ariz.

"                          Testing is emerging as one of the biggest issues of the coronavirus response so far. “Do not underestimate the challenge the Senate could face passing this bill.” Those were the words of a senior Republican source about how tough the path may be for the Senate to align with the House of Representatives and approve a massive coronavirus measure. There is one school of thought that the Senate could simply take up the House bill and pass it on the spot. But frankly, the course is much, much harder than that.  US SHOULD REEVALUATE RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA AFTER CORONAVIRUS, REP SAYS In fact, there are some technical problems in the drafting of the coronavirus legislation that requires the House to pass the bill again – perhaps with a skeleton staff – later this week. More on that in a moment. The House overwhelmingly okayed the emergency coronavirus package in the wee hours of Saturday morning after more than 20 phone calls between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. “What made it hard is that we could never get everyone in the same room,” said one source. In other words, social distancing contributed to a problem in the drafting of the legislation and trading of offers. Usually, the sides would lock themselves into a room and go around the table. But not in the age of coronavirus.  That prompted dozens upon dozens of phone calls between Pelosi, Mnuchin, other officials at Treasury, the White House, Republican Congressional leaders, House Committees, legislative counsel, et al. You get the idea. Don’t forget that President Woodrow Wilson fell ill with the Spanish Flu in 1919. Wilson’s bout with the flu nearly sidetracked the Treaty of Versailles to end World War I. In other words, there’s precedent for pandemics shaping the curve of negotiating some of the most important things in politics. So, the road to passage in the Senate? Unclear – even though 140 House GOPers voted for the plan in a witching hour vote Saturday morning and President Trump tweeted his support for it – just hours after dismissing the legislation. Perhaps Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) was prescient about the possible problems facing the Senate with this bill. McConnell bolted from the Capitol mid-afternoon Thursday as Pelosi and Mnuchin continued to talk. There was no clear route to pass any coronavirus bill on Thursday afternoon. There was no final bill. And, it took the House an additional 34 hours to assemble the coronavirus package. But Pelosi and Mnuchin wouldn’t have continued to bargain into the night on Thursday and all day Friday had there not been a deal to be had. So, when the Senate finally adjourned Thursday, it locked in a procedural vote at 5:30 p.m. et Monday – related to FISA. That’s the controversial surveillance program which expired over the weekend. Yep. Nothing pertaining to (at that point) any possible coronavirus bill. In fact, the Monday vote tied to FISA in the Senate is two parliamentary steps removed from actually reauthorizing FISA. In Senate language, this is a motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the FISA bill. In layman’s terms, that means the Senate must break a filibuster (with 60 yeas) just to start debate on FISA. If 60 senators vote yes, and there’s no other agreement, and they do it by the book, then the Senate wouldn’t formally start debate until late Tuesday night on FISA. Another procedural vote would be required later in the week just to wrap up all debate. Only then would the Senate be able to vote on FISA and move to the House coronavirus bill. That’s if they do it by the book. And Fox is told there are plenty of senators who want to alter the House coronavirus bill. Let’s start with the status of the FISA package. Attorney General Bill Barr came to Capitol Hill last Monday night to negotiate a final version with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) and members of the conservative Freedom Caucus. The sides forged a bipartisan pact with Pelosi and other Democrats. The House approved the FISA renewal. And then President Trump tweeted that “Many Republican Senators want me to Veto the FISA bill until we find out what led to, and happened with, the illegal attempted ‘coup’ of the duly elected President of the United States and others!” But McCarthy signaled Friday night he expected Mr. Trump to sign FISA once it got through the Senate. In other words, if the Senate can wrap up FISA quickly, only then can the senators advance to the coronavirus bill. But if FISA is stalled, who knows. A top aide to McConnell e-mailed the Capitol Hill press corps after the House finished voting in the wee hours of Saturday morning. The staffer observed it would take the cooperation of 100 senators to start work on the coronavirus bill – regardless of FISA. But, since the House must still resolve problems with its own bill, McConnell suggested Sunday night that it would wait for the House to re-approve that measure.  A senior House Democratic aide expected the House to pass the fixed version of the bill via unanimous consent this week – that’s so long as no one objects. An objection from any lawmaker would stall the bill in the House and require all House members to return to Washington to vote.  You might recall an episode last spring where the House tried to move a $19.1 billion disaster measure to help areas ravaged by hurricanes and flooding. The House hoped to okay the plan via unanimous consent since communities needed the funding. Yet on three different occasions, Reps. Chip Roy (R-TX), Thomas Massie (R-KY) and John Rose (R-TN) all objected. That delayed the bill – forcing the House to vote on the package about a week later. So…. One may ask who would want to get in the way of getting the actual coronavirus bill over to the Senate. Well, there is precedent for lawmakers blocking swift approval of the disaster bill. Many of the 40 House Republicans who opposed the measure Saturday morning complained they only had a few minutes to read the coronavirus bill text. And, to this point, no one truly knows the cost of the measure. It’s anywhere from tens of billions of dollars to the hundreds of billions of dollars.  “We don’t know the price tag because we don’t know the coronavirus model yet,” said one source.  The world has never witnessed a modern pandemic like coronavirus. So any attempt to assign a dollar figure at this stage is potentially a fool’s errand. Keep in mind that this coronavirus bill was supposed to be the easy bill. One can anticipate just how complicated and onerous other bills could be. Industry bailouts. Increases in wages. Back pay. Amplified social programs. A recalibration of health care. Oh, and don’t forget the looming issues with re-insurance. Say what? Here we have a major event which upends the economy and forces the cancellation of practically everything. As we saw after 9/11, it may be tough for some current insurers to remain solvent because of major payouts. Therefore, insurance firms cede the risk to another insurer. That helps mitigate some of the risk. Complicated? You bet.  It’s truly unclear what path the Senate may take with the coronavirus measure this week. Or, maybe it bleeds into next week.  And that’s the issue. Some will argue Congress needs to act – and fast. Others will protest that the bill(s) are too big. Too massive. Congress should slow down. “This all needs to be sorted out at the usual Tuesday lunches,” said one source, referring to the typical policy lunches on Capitol Hill. Each Tuesday, all of the Republicans huddle in the Mike Mansfield Room at the Capitol for lunch. The Democrats crowd into the Lyndon B. Johnson Room.  Yes. Business as usual, apparently. Senators bunching up together in the same room – over lunch, no less.  “We really just need to get these guys out of the building, before everyone gets sick,” said one aide.

"                          Reaction from liberal analyst Cathy Areu and Republican strategist Ash Wright. When the leadership of the Democratic Party and CNN and Uninavision chose March 15 as the date for their eleventh and hopefully last debate, they certainly could not envision the political environment or the crisis that the nation and the world faced. Unfortunately for the country, other than a general attack on PresidentTrump and the usual “Go look at my web page to find my solutions,” this could have been any of the earlier debates with all the other candidates thrown in. The earlier ones were much more entertaining than Sunday night's snoozer. Former Vice President Joe.Biden did better than usual. He probably did enough to continue on his path to the nomination. He didn’t stumble, which we all wait for with great anticipation every time he speaks in public. MARY ANNE MARSH: IN BIDEN-SANDERS DEBATE, SOLUTIONS WIN AND REVOLUTION LOSES Biden did his usual, pandering. A program for everybody. A woman vice president, a black woman on the Supreme Court. Nothing wrong with that, but it might be better if he named who they would be and their qualifications. He also laid out many policy issues that Trump and his supporters will hammer him on in a general election campaign. Wide-open borders, for a start. He also continued on his path to take credit for everything President Barack Obama did except choosing him as vice president. Bernie Sanders is an agent of change who certainly is more knowledgeable about his record and probably Biden's too. Young people who want a revolution have their candidate. It came down to a two-person show between the two oldest candidates running for the nomination. They sound like old men living in the past. And I say that as an old white man who liked much in the past. Ironically, the man they hope to face off against is now the nation's oldest president. Of course, all anyone cares about right now is the most complicated crisis ever to face the United States and the world. This is not a world war or even a civil war, both of which we survived, but it is unlike anything any of us have faced in the last half-century. Biden, if elected, will restore the Democrat agenda. Take care of the lobbyists and refill the swamp. You get the Obama agenda “lite” without the Obama charm. Our nation's health and economy are at serious risk. Our nation is frightened and the question of presidential leadership is what Sunday's debate was about and it is what the November election will be about. It's not going to be decided about policy. It's about leadership. Trump is trailing both of these candidates. But the ball is in his court. He has an excellent medical team around him and if he listens to them and gets us through this most difficult challenge, he wins. If he gets distracted, as he often does, it will be a very close race. I am a Republican supporter of Trump and wouldn’t vote for Biden or Sanders under any circumstance. So my opinion is irrelevant. Biden, if elected, will restore the Democrat agenda. Take care of the lobbyists and refill the swamp. You get the Obama agenda “lite” without the Obama charm.

"                          Supreme Court postpones March oral arguments over coronavirus concerns. This is the first health crisis-related delay for such proceedings since the Spanish flu a century ago. The Supreme Court announced Monday that it will postpone oral arguments for its March session due to concerns over the coronavirus outbreak -- marking the first health crisis-related delay for such proceedings since the Spanish flu a century ago. Those arguments include cases scheduled to come before the court on March 23-25 and March 30-April 1. A press release from the high court said the justices will hold their regular conference on Friday and issue their order list on Monday, though the release said ""some Justices may participate remotely by telephone."" CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW       The Supreme Court is putting off the oral arguments scheduled for its March session, but will still be open for business. This is the first time the court has postponed its oral arguments since the 1918 Spanish flu outbreak. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)       WHO ARE THE 9 JUSTICES ON THE SUPREME COURT The Supreme Court building was already closed to the public last week, and it will remain open for business even as the oral arguments -- which see the justices, several of whom are senior citizens, packed in the courtroom with hundreds of lawyers, activists, members of parties and journalists -- are postponed. Filing deadlines will not be extended, according to the Supreme Court's news release. With the peak of coronavirus spread in the United States not yet in sight, it is unclear when the delayed cases will be heard or if more could be postponed down the road. The cases affected by the postponement will include three cases involving access to President Trump's financial documents for the House Ways and Means Committee and the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, which were scheduled for argument on March 31. Also on hold are a case regarding military prosecution of rape, a trademark case, a high-profile copyright case between tech giants Google and Oracle, a lawsuit by three Muslims who were put on the ""No Fly List"" after refusing to inform to the FBI, a case on the composition of Delaware's state courts, a case on international funding to fight HIV, a Fourth Amendment case, a deportation case and a case on religiously-based discrimination. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP According to the court, the last time the Supreme Court postponed oral arguments due to a health crisis was 1918 as the Spanish flu, which sickened U.S. President Woodrow Wilson at the time, afflicted the United States. The court also reduced its oral arguments in 1793 and 1798 due to yellow fever fears.

"                          'This is where America shines,' says Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine and professor at Baylor College of Medicine. How concerned are you about the coronavirus outbreak? The answer may depend on whether you’re a Democrat or Republican, a new national poll suggests. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey released Sunday found that just over half of Americans are worried that a family member may catch the virus that causes COVID-19, and that six in 10 say the worst is yet to come regarding the pandemic. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW But the poll, which was conducted almost entirely before President Trump declared a national emergency on Friday, points to a wide partisan divide on attitudes regarding the outbreak. Sixty-eight percent of Democrats said they were concerned that a family member could contract the virus. But that number dropped to 40 percent among Republicans. Nearly eight in 10 Democrats felt the worst was yet to come in coping with the pandemic. That number dropped in half to 40 percent among Republicans.  Six in 10 Democrats said they’ve stopped or plan to stop going to any large gatherings. That percentage dropped in half for Republicans. And 47 percent of Democrats, but just 23 percent of Republicans, said they were canceling or rescheduling travel plans. Spotlighting the gravity of the situation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Sunday recommended against holding gatherings of 50 people or more for the next eight weeks. The president, at a Sunday news conference, told Americans to “relax” and said “we’re doing great, it will all pass” as he urged shoppers not to hoard supplies and food at stories. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE CORONVIRUS OUTBREAK According to the poll, 45 percent of Americans gave the president a thumbs up for how he’s handling the coronavirus outbreak. But there’s a gigantic partisan divide. Eighty-one percent of Republicans, but just 13 percent of Democrats, approved of the job he’s doing battling the virus, with independents at 43 percent. The NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll was conducted March 11-13 (Wednesday-Friday), with 900 registered voters nationwide questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s overall sampling error is 3.3 percentage points.

"                          With COVID-19 being declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), it is now more important than ever to prepare yourself for a potential quarantine. Here’s what you should stock up in the midst of this outbreak. Entrepreneur and former presidential candidate Andrew Yang is not being shy about his belief that the impact of the coronavirus outbreak makes the case for his trademark proposal of giving Americans cash so they can have an economic boost. Yang is now calling on lawmakers to do just that to help people navigate their way through the pandemic that has resulted in governments ordering schools and many businesses to close. CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK SPURS NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY, CONNECTICUT TO SHUT BARS, RESTAURANTS AND MOVIE THEATERS ""What exactly is the political downside of putting money into people’s hands? Get your sh-- together Congress and do the right thing,"" Yang tweeted Monday morning. Yang then retweeted a video of Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., on Fox News, where the Republican said legislation from the House did not go far enough. ""We’re going to do everything we can to get cash into the hands of affected workers and families as quickly as possible so we can all get through this pandemic together,"" Cotton said.

Mitt Romney, R-Utah, had a similar but more limited idea, issuing a statement Monday that called for all American adults to receive checks for $1,000 ""to help ensure families and workers can meet their short-term obligations and increase spending in the economy.""

"                          Ellison Barber reports from Columbus, Ohio with a recap of what the Democrat candidates said about coronavirus. After Sunday night’s debate, expect Joe Biden to be all for social distancing as a candidate. He will be perfectly fine staying at home and keeping to himself. It’s the best prevention from voters catching that the Joe Biden we thought we knew is gone. The question is, how long can he get away with it? Traditionally, there are two mistakes that doom candidates. From all appearances, the guy who wants to be known as “Uncle Joe” is going two for two. Mistake One: You cannot play to negative stereotype. If you are the oldest white guy that voters have to choose from in November, it is probably not a good thing to have “Creepy Joe” be one of your search engine results. MARY ANNE MARSH: IN BIDEN-SANDERS DEBATE, SOLUTIONS WIN AND REVOLUTION LOSES Biden’s history of what is widely viewed as improper behavior toward women is well documented. Remember when Biden took the hand of a 24-year-old activist in New Hampshire, called her “kiddo” and told her to “look at my eyes” as he promised to “end fossil fuel.” Further, his sniffing women’s hair and acting inappropriately is unhelpful to demonstrating he gets the #MeToo world. Day after day, the negative stereotype of Biden being out of touch gets reinforced. Any attempts by advisers to hide him to avoid further exposure of these characteristics will never succeed in keeping reality from the voters. In some ways, Biden apparent clinching of the nomination so quickly could backfire on him. The more Americans witness him first-hand, the more the evidence will mount that he is coming pretty close to defining the negative stereotype he needs to avoid. Mistake Two: Do nothing to undermine the positive aspects of yourself that you're “selling.” In business, this is called avoiding compromising the brand. The former vice president’s candidacy has been centered on him being Uncle Joe — reasonable, positive, steady and friendly. In terms of policy and persona, Biden is failing miserably in living up to that brand. Biden was supposedly the “centrist-moderate” candidate. Yet, during the campaign, he has fallen over himself to prove to the most “progressive” members of the party that they can depend on him. Biden was supposedly the “centrist-moderate” among the Democratic presidential contenders. Yet, during the campaign, he has fallen over himself to prove to the most “progressive” members of the party that they can depend on him. Can centrist-moderate Americans really feel good about Biden wanting to automatically enroll them in a government-run “public option” and push out private insurance plans? This would put Washington, D.C., more in charge of health care, with costs going up and access going down. As for reasonable, how comfortable can centrist-moderate Americans be with Biden’s embrace of the Green New Deal? It puts him shoulder to shoulder with Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Let’s face it, their alleged concern for the environment is mere cover for what the impact of the Green New Deal will truly be for Americans. It would cause the largest shift of decision-making away from Americans and to government overlords in our country’s history. Quality of life for all would decline with the amount of taxes needed to pay for their alleged environmental protections. One example: economists say gas taxes would need to rise by $10 to $15 per gallon as a result of the deal. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER When it comes to Biden being steady and ready to sit in the Oval Office, his silly statements, stumbling on key facts and forgetting what he is saying in mid-sentence sends the exact opposite message. For example, at a speech in Houston, Texas, Biden seemingly forgot the words to the Declaration of Independence.  He said: “We hold these truths to be self-evident. All men and women created … by the — you know — you know the thing.” As to being positive and upbeat, Biden now regularly berates potential voters with profanity if they disagree with him. Whether telling a retired Iowa farmer that “You’re a damn liar, man” or yelling “Don’t be such a horse’s ass” and “You’re full of s---” to a Detroit union worker, Biden is showing himself to be intolerant and unfriendly. He leaves little doubt that he would rather shout down those with whom he disagrees rather than have a respectful, open conversation. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Maybe Biden and his advisers believe all of this helps show he is up to the task of “taking Trump head-on.”  Maybe, but it is compromising the basic brand. All in all, it is indeed remarkable that Joe Biden is on the verge of completely clinching the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination.  Still, one has to ask, how long can Biden get away with what he is doing?

"                          Coronavirus task force urge drastic measures to slow spread; reaction and analysis from the 'Special Report' All-Stars. President Trump announced on Monday a set of guidelines that he said Americans should follow to prevent the further spread of the coronavirus -- despite admitting that the pandemic could stretch into July or August. Speaking during a briefing of the coronavirus task force, Trump outlined a plan to slow the spread of COVID-19 in 15 days. “With several weeks of focused action, we can turn the corner and turn it quickly,” Trump said. “Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes.” CLICK FOR THE CORONAVIRUS GUIDELINES RELEASED BY THE WHITE HOUSE At another point during the news conference, asked if the U.S. was headed into a recession, Trump replied: “Well, it may be.” But then, he said, “We're not thinking in terms of recession, we're thinking in terms of the virus.” The guidelines advised that older people and those with underlying health conditions “stay home and away from other people.” Officials recommended that large swaths of the population isolate themselves and everyone avoid social gatherings or groups of more than 10 people. They also said Americans should work from home if possible; avoid eating or drinking in bars and restaurants; and “avoid discretionary travel, shopping trips, and social visits.” When asked when the pandemic would subside, Trump said that “if we do a really good job,” the crisis could pass by July or August, a far less optimistic take than in his earlier predictions that it could be over within weeks. “We will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus,” he added. Trump's comments came as Ohio's governor announced his recommendation to delay the state's primary election until June amid the outbreak. The president said that while the state's whose presidential primary elections are being very careful, he thinks postponing elections are ""unnecessary."" ""Postponing is not a very good thing,"" he said. ""I think postponing is unnecessary.” The coronavirus pandemic has infected over 169,000 people and killed over 6,500. The COVID-19 illness has caused mild or moderate symptoms for most patients, but severe symptoms have been more likely in the elderly or people with existing health problems. More than 77,000 people have recovered from it so far, mostly in China. The U.S. surgeon general said Monday that the United States was about where Italy was two weeks ago in the coronavirus struggle, a sign that infections were expected to rise. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW “We are at a critical inflection point in this country, people,” Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams told Fox News. “When you look at the projections, there's every chance that we could be Italy.” Still, he said the U.S. had opportunities to mitigate the pandemic. On Fox News, Adams claimed the U.S. had “turned the tide” on testing, a critical part of tracking and containing pandemics, but whether that was true remained to be seen. The U.S. effort has been hobbled by a series of missteps, including flaws with the testing kits first distributed by the federal government and bureaucratic hurdles that held up testing by private laboratories. But, Trump, who has been sharply criticized for underplaying the severity of the crisis, stuck to his optimistic tone about the nation's response. “Everybody is so well unified and working so hard,” he tweeted. “It is a beautiful thing to see.” The Associated Press contributed to this report.

"                          Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Gov. Mike DeWine on Monday night announced his state's health director will order Ohio's polls to be closed Tuesday ""as a health emergency"" over the spread of the coronavirus, a dramatic move just hours before the state's scheduled primaries. DeWine had recommended that the primaries be postponed, but a county judge had denied the request Monday evening. ""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus. As such, Health Director Dr. Amy Acton will order the polls closed as a health emergency. While the polls will be closed tomorrow, Secretary of State Frank LaRose will seek a remedy through the courts to extend voting options so that every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity,"" DeWine said in a statement. “The only thing more important than a free and fair election is the health and safety of Ohioans. The Ohio Department of Health and the CDC have advised against anyone gathering in groups larger than 50 people, which will occur if the election goes forward. Additionally, Ohioans over 65 and those with certain health conditions have been advised to limit their nonessential contact with others, affecting their ability to vote or serve as poll workers,” DeWine and LaRose said earlier, after the judge's ruling. “Logistically, under these extraordinary circumstances, it simply isn’t possible to hold an election tomorrow that will be considered legitimate by Ohioans. They mustn’t be forced to choose between their health and exercising their constitutional rights.” MARCH 17 PRIMARIES: HERE ARE THE STATES VOTING AND THE DELEGATES AT STAKE President Trump -- speaking at a coronavirus briefing at the White House Monday afternoon -- said he'd leave such decisions on postponing a primary up to the states but emphasized, ""I think postponing is unnecessary."" Ohio is the only one of the four states scheduled to hold presidential primaries on Tuesday to move to postpone its contest. Officials in the other states - Arizona, Florida and Illinois - said their primaries would still take place. The governor's office had filed the lawsuit in Franklin County with the hopes that it would quickly receive court approval. The governor’s move came a day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Sunday recommended against holding gatherings of 50 people or more for the next eight weeks. STATES THAT HAVE POSTPONED PRIMARIES DUE TO CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK The governor also said: ""It is clear that tomorrow’s in-person voting does not conform with the CDC guidelines. We cannot conduct this election tomorrow, the in-person voting for 13 hours tomorrow – and conform to these guidelines.” The governor also emphasized that “ultimately it is not fair to make people pick between their health and constitutional rights. Voters can vote by mail, and this will help us achieve the goal that people maintain their constitutional rights safely.” DeWine also recommended that “between now and then absentee ballot voting be permitted.” A LOOK AT FLORIDA’S PRIMARY WINNERS IN PAST PRESIDENTIAL CONTESTS Soon after the move by DeWine to postpone primary day in Ohio, officials in Florida and Illinois announced that their primaries were still on for Tuesday. “I wanted to let you know that Illinois is proceeding with plans for tomorrow’s primary as scheduled,” Illinois State Board of Elections public information officer Matt Dietrich wrote in an email to reporters. Dietrich highlighted that as of Monday, 504,000 early votes had already been cast and that 294,000 mail ballots had been sent to voters. Both figures were significantly higher than in the 2016 primary. “With early voting continuing today, we likely will see a substantial increase when early voting sites close. We along with the state’s 108 local election authorities had been encouraging early voting for several weeks and in the past two weeks had increased our efforts so voters could vote early and avoid lines and crowds on election day out of concern for coronavirus,” he emphasized. In justifying the decision to go forward with the primary, Dietrich noted that “much of the voting for this election already has been done. Also, at this point there is no date in the foreseeable future when we can expect greater safety with any certainty.” And pointing to Illinois Gov. Jay Pritzker’s order to close restaurants and bars except for carryout service, he said “we want to point out that in-person voting is a comparable transaction to picking up a takeout restaurant order or shopping at a grocery store. There is no need for close contact when requesting a ballot from an election judge and Illinois does not require voters to show ID; a voter’s signature compared to the signature on record is proof of identity. Primary voting typically is a swift transaction that can be done at a safe distance from other voters.” Florida’s Department of State told Fox News “we are moving forward” with their primary. Earlier Monday, Secretary of State Laurel M Lee tweeted “we are aware of voters’ concerns over #COVID19. FL Dept of Health has assured healthy Floridians it’s safe to work the polls for & vote in Tuesday’s election. Supervisors of Elections are ensuring polls are prepared for voters.” Arizona Gov. Steve Ducey announced a couple of hours later that their primary would also be held on Tuesday. ""We’ve made sure that election officials have the equipment and the support they need for the polling places to function tomorrow. Our elected leaders have been working overtime to ensure that voting is safe,"" the governor said. Secretary of State Katie Hobbs explained ""this decision was not made lightly and what it all comes down to is that we have no guarantee that there will be a safer time to hold this election in the near future."" ""There are thousands of workers across the state that must continue the job of counting the ballots in the days following the election. The longer we wait, the more difficult and dangerous this becomes,"" she emphasized. Earlier in the day, she tweeted instructions and suggestions for voters to stay safe avoid contracting the coronavirus while casting their ballot. Over a couple of days, Georgia, Louisana and Puerto Rico -- which have upcoming contests -- have delayed their primaries until later in the spring. Biden's election eve lead Joe Biden holds a commanding lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders in Arizona, according to two new polls released on the eve of that state’s presidential primary. A Monmouth University survey released on Monday shows the former vice president with 51 percent support among likely Democratic presidential primary voters. Sanders – the populist lawmaker from Vermont who’s making his second straight White House run – stands at 31 percent.  That's 20 percentage points behind Biden. And Biden leads Sanders by 17 points – 53-36 percent – in an NBC News/Marist poll that also released on Monday. Sixty-seven pledged delegates are up for grabs in Arizona. Biden tops Sanders 58-35 percent in an NBC News/Marist poll in Ohio, where 136 pledged delegates are at stake if the contest is held. The most recent polls in Florida and Illinois also indicated Biden enjoying large double-digit leads over Sanders. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal national survey released on Sunday showed Biden with a nearly two-to-one advantage over Sanders in the race for the Democratic nomination. In the last two and a half weeks, Sanders has watched Biden zoom past him in the race for the presidential nomination. Following a landslide win in South Carolina’s primary and sweeping victories in the coast-to-coast Super Tuesday states as well as last week’s mini Super Tuesday, the former vice president cemented his position as the unrivaled front-runner and has taken a commanding lead in the all-important race for convention delegates.

"                          Will Joe Biden fail in a general election without Sen. Bernie Sanders' diehard supporters? It's clear – Joe Biden has his work cut out for him as he tries to unite the Democratic Party. The day after delivering a more aggressive than expected debate performance against the former vice president and current presidential primary front-runner, Sen. Bernie Sanders vowed that “this primary is far from over.” In an email to supporters, the progressive firebrand from Vermont took aim at his rival as he spotlighted that Biden “has argued that we have to cut Social Security, voted for the war in Iraq, supported the Hyde Amendment that restricts poor women’s access to abortion, has threatened to veto legislation that will guarantee health care as a right, led the fight for the disastrous bankruptcy bill.”  BIDEN UP 20 POINTS OVER SANDERS IN ARIZONA ON EVE OF PRIMARY: POLL Sanders also targeted Biden on Twitter, writing “you need to take on Wall Street, the drug companies, the insurance companies, and the fossil fuel industry. You don’t take campaign contributions from them.” The night before, during the debate, the self-declared democratic socialist repeatedly jabbed at Biden over his long record in Washington, his fundraising from corporations and his support from outside super PACs. Sanders also turned down a symbolic policy olive branch from Biden, who in the lead-up to the debate embraced progressive policies pushed by Sanders on free college tuition and bankruptcy reform. A frustrated Biden said during the prime-time showdown that Sanders is “making it hard for me” to bridge the gap between them. The deep policy divisions on display during and following the debate are, in turn, renewing fears that Democrats could experience a repeat of 2016 – when many Sanders supporters wouldn't vote for eventual nominee Hillary Clinton after a long and divisive primary battle. Democrats, desperate to defeat President Donald Trump in November’s general election, are trying to prevent heading into the general election with the progressive base of the party once again fractured. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN Since Biden’s sweeping victories in last Tuesday’s primaries, when he took a large lead over Sanders in the crucial race for convention delegates and cemented his front-runner status, #NeverBiden has started to trend on Twitter. And Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York – a top Sanders surrogate and progressive rock star – took to Twitter Sunday night to repeatedly bash Biden over what she seemed to frame as policy flip-flops. The tweet indicated lingering resistance on the left to embracing Biden's appeals to progressives. “Don’t say you support a fracking ban when you don’t. Don’t say you didn’t write the bankruptcy bill when you were one of it’s biggest champions. Don’t say you supported ending Hyde a long time ago when you were just pressured into it last year,” the congresswoman tweeted. “This is basic. The truth matters.” As he tries to keep the peace, a comment immediately after the debate from a Biden senior adviser may not have helped. “It’s safe to say Vice President Biden showed up to a debate tonight and for two hours graciously [dealt] with a kind of protester who often shows up at campaign events, on live television,” Anita Dunn told reporters on a conference call. Others on the call worried about a drawn-out and contentious primary harming the party's general election goals. The latest clashes have a leading Sanders supporter in New Hampshire worried. “Yes. It will be work and I intend to work as hard as I can to unite the ticket, as I did in 2016,” former state Sen. Burt Cohen told Fox News. “It’s not going to be easy. I hope it’s not as hard as it was in 2016.” And Cohen is not sure Biden’s up to the task of bringing the Sanders wing of the party into the fold. “I worry about Joe Biden frankly,” Cohen said. “When I see him, he doesn’t have any charisma. He doesn’t get people excited.” Adam Green, co-founder of the pro-Warren Progressive Change Campaign Committee, last week urged Sanders to stay in the race to debate Biden.  “He was more aggressive than I thought he was going to be but he was less effective at securing concrete commitments on progressive issues from Biden than I thought he would be given how aggressive he was,” noted Green, who along with the PCCC were major supporters of progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s White House bid. Asked if he’s concerned about a repeat of the 2016 Democratic divisions, Green told Fox News “not yet.” “Especially in this new coronavirus crisis world, Democrats need to see how our nominee will campaign and sturdy they are and last night’s debate – even if it was a bit messy – was productive for both candidates to seem more presidential and more correct on policy than Trump. More of that so we have a tested candidate is good.” Democratic strategist Chris Moyer disagreed with those predicting another chasm. “It does not seem like Senator Sanders is taking the same approach as he did four years ago,” argued Moyer, a veteran of the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign as well as Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey’s 2020 White House bid. “While many thought he might handle the debate differently, right now there are not broad concerns about a long, drawn-out primary that hurts our eventual nominee, which is quite clearly going to be Vice President Biden.”    ",         Democrats face 2016 déjà vu as left resists peace with primary front-runner,         2020-03-16T141337-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/democrats-face-2016-deja-vu-as-left-resists-peace-with-primary-front-runner,Fox
"                          Insight from Fox News contributor Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, emergency medicine physician. The California Legislature approved up to $1 billion in new spending on Monday to combat the coronavirus outbreak, then suspended their work for the next month to try and contain the illness. It is believed to be the first unexpected work stoppage in the California Legislature in 158 years, according to Alex Vassar, an unofficial legislative historian at the California State Library. And it came on the heels of extraordinary bipartisanship, as Republicans and Democrats alike voted overwhelmingly to give Gov. Gavin Newsom broad authority to spend during the crisis without their oversight. “It is a request to step away from our desks much earlier than we would like. The demands of public health require it,” Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon said. The California Legislature has rarely closed. The Legislature did not miss meetings during either of the world wars or in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. In 2001, when a semi-truck crashed into the Senate side of the Capitol, the Senate convened right on schedule about 12 hours later in the Assembly chambers. And last year, when a woman threw her own blood onto the floor of the state Senate in an act of protest on the session’s final day, lawmakers reconvened hours later in a committee room to finish their work. The only time lawmakers did unexpectedly suspend their meetings was in 1862, when a flood consumed most of Sacramento and, legend has it, forced newly elected Gov. Leland Stanford to use a boat to attend his inauguration. Lawamkers missed a few days before reconvening in San Francisco to continue their work, according Vassar. In 1919, during a flu pandemic, at least five lawmakers had symptoms and had to be quarantined. Leaders discussed whether lawmakers should stop meeting, but eventually decided to “disinfect the Capitol daily and to keep meeting,” Vassar said. “It is an extremely rare occurrence for the Legislature to stop meeting during the regular session,” Vassar said. Lawmakers agreed Monday to stay away until April 13. But legislative leaders in either chamber can decide to reconvene. And they can extend the recess if necessary. “We will be prepared on a moment’s notice to return ton address any urgent action that we must take,” Senate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins said. The legislation approved Monday gives Gov. Gavin Newsom $500 million to spend “for any item for any purpose” related to his March 4 declaration of emergency. In the future, Newsom could increase that spending by increments of $50 million — but only if he tells lawmakers about it three days in advance. The spending is capped at $1 billion. “By taking this action we are placing an extraordinary degree of trust in Gov. Gavin Newsom. However, these are extraordinary times,” said Republican Assemblyman Jay Obernolte. A separate bill would make sure public schools that closed because of the outbreak don’t lose funding. It would also allocate $100 million to schools for “personal protective equipment” or to pay for “supplies and labor related to cleaning.” State law bans lawmakers from voting on bills unless they have been available for public review for at least three days. But lawmakers can waive that law if the governor asks them to. Newsom did that on Monday. “Today I write to you to state the obvious: we must rise to the challenge facing our state with every tool at our disposal and without a second of delay,” Newsom wrote in a letter to the Legislature. “We cannot hesitate to meet this moment.” Lawmakers overwhelmingly voted to approve his request. Lawmakers were in action on Monday while most other entities in California were closed. Sunday, Newsom urged everyone 65 and older to stay home. Presumably, that order included the 25 lawmakers in the state Legislature who are older than 65. Assemblyman Jose Medina, 66, said he was already on a plane headed to Sacramento on Sunday when Newsom asked people 65 and older to stay home. He attended Monday’s Assembly session, saying he thought his constituents would “appreciate that we are still doing the work of the state of California.” “It’s nothing that I would take lightly, and I think that most folks my age and older are taking it seriously,” said Medina, a Democrat who represents Riverside. But 73-year-old Assemblyman Bill Quirk stayed home. He lives in a retirement community in the San Francisco Bay Area with his wife. While the two of them are healthy, many of their neighbors are not. GET THE FOX NEWS APP “If I were to bring home the coronavirus, 20 people could die, or maybe even 40,” Quirk said. “Some people think they are really important and they should always be working. And I can tell you I’m not so important that we can even risk one life here, period.”    ",         California legislature suspends meeting for first time in 158 years,         2020-03-17T010920-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/california-legislature-suspends-meeting-for-first-time-in-158-years,Fox
"                          The Trump campaign files a libel lawsuit against New York Times for the paper's March 27, 2019 op-ed titled ‘The Real Trump-Russia Quid Pro Quo;’ reaction and analysis from ‘Media Buzz’ host Howard Kurtz. In a striking and unexpected abandonment of a once-heralded prosecution initiated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, the Justice Department moved Monday to drop charges against two Russian companies that were accused of funding a social media meme campaign to further their “strategic goal to sow discord in the U.S. political system, including the 2016 presidential election.” Late Monday, with jury selection in the case set to begin in just two weeks, a federal judge granted the DOJ's motion to kill the prosecution. The government acknowledged the Russian companies were never likely to actually face punishment anyway and cited possible national security risks with going forward to trial. Concord Management and Consulting LLC and Concord Catering were among three companies and 13 individuals charged in February 2018 by Mueller. Their alleged criminal effort included social media postings and campaigns aimed at dividing American public opinion and sowing discord in the electorate, officials said, although no actual impact on voters was ever proven. Of the 13 Russians and three Russian companies charged by Mueller in the social media disinformation effort, Concord was the sole defendant to enter an appearance in Washington’s federal court and contest and the allegations. Mueller's 37-page indictment said the actions detailed by prosecutors dated back to 2014. (Mueller later brought separate charges against other entities related to a hack of Democrats' emails in the summer of 2018.) READ THE DOJ'S MOTION TO DROP CHARGES President Trump noted that no Russian collusion with his campaign was ever proven, and Republicans and even left-of-center commenators argued that Russian disinformation was mostly irrelevant, given that social media and other platforms are already rife with inaccuracies. ""Before a pandemic, there was a time when we were relentlessly told to fear Russian social media accounts,"" mused journalist Aaron Mate on Monday. ""Their juvenile memes not only elected Trump, but also 'sowed chaos.' When Mueller indicted 13 Russians over it, he was hailed as a hero. Well, DOJ just dropped the case."" Various media outlets had hyped the indictment, with NPR calling the Russians' activities an ""attack"" on democracy.  ""For me, personally, hearing these charges and hearing what they were charging these Russians for -- it was the first time that I felt like finally, finally, for the first time since we realized all this was happened, finally, it feels like someone is defending us,"" MSNBC host Rachel Maddow said at the time, seemingly holding back tears. Concord is controlled by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a wealthy businessman known as “Putin’s chef” for his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. He has been hit with U.S. sanctions over Russian interference in the 2016 election and is charged alongside his company in the indictment brought by Mueller.

The Justice Department is moving to drop charges against some Russian companies that were accused of funding a social media campaign to sway American public opinion during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. (Sergei Ilnitsky/Pool Photo via AP, File)       The company, with the help of a high-powered law firm, filed a series of motions over the last two years, including to dismiss charges and to exclude certain evidence from the case. In January 2019, prosecutors said confidential material from the Russia investigation, which had been handed over to defense attorneys for Concord, was altered and released online as part of a disinformation campaign to discredit the special counsel's Russia investigation. READ MUELLER'S INITIAL INDICTMENT The files surfaced online in a link posted by a pro-Russia Twitter account. But the Justice Department stopped short of accusing Concord of leaking the material. Still, they argued that the company’s request to have sensitive new evidence sent to Russia “unreasonably risks the national security interests of the United States.”       Special Counsel Robert Mueller announced the prosecution of Russian trolls in 2018; that prosecution is now dropped. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File)       Some of the court appearances in the case have been unusually contentious, with the federal judge overseeing it chastising a lawyer for the company, Eric Dubelier, for references in court filings to Looney Tunes and the 1978 raunchy comedy “Animal House” to criticize the Mueller investigation. “I’ll say it plain and simply: Knock it off,” U.S District Judge Dabney Friedrich told Dubelier at a January 2019 court appearance. Dubelier, who has referred to the case as involving a “made up” crime, has made allegations of prosecutorial misconduct and even once accused the judge of bias. JUDGE SLAMS DNC OVER LAWSUIT AGAINST TRUMP CAMP, SAYS NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION ""The real Department of Justice"" never would have brought the case,"" Dubelier said at one 2018 hearing. At one point, he curtly rejected a DOJ summons, saying prosecutors ""are already behaving in a manner that is inconsistent with the practices of the DOJ."" He also accused the DOJ of having ""indicted the proverbial ham sandwich."" And, the Twitter user Techno Fog observed that Dubelier also flatly accused one of Mueller's prosecutors of being a liar. But with the case approaching trial, prosecutors beat a hasty retreat, and said they had to weigh the risk of potentially exposing sensitive national security information against the benefits of continuing with the case against a company that likely wouldn’t face any significant punishment in the United States. In the court filing on Monday, prosecutors said Concord had been “eager and aggressive in using the judicial system to gather information about how the United States detects and prevents foreign election interference.” “In short, Concord has demonstrated its intent to reap the benefits of the Court’s jurisdiction while positioning itself to evade any real obligations or responsibility,” prosecutors wrote in Monday’s filing. “It is no longer in the best interests of justice or the country’s national security to continue this prosecution."" At the same time, Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers and U.S. Attorney for Washington Timothy Shea defended the initial indictment. ""There is a substantial federal interest in defending American democratic institutions, exposing those who endeavor to criminally interfere with them, and holding them accountable, which is why this prosecution was properly commenced in the first place,"" the prosecutors said. They added: ""In light of the defendant’s conduct, however, its ephemeral presence and immunity to just punishment, the risk of exposure of law enforcement’s tools and techniques, and the post-indictment change in the proof available at trial, the balance of equities has shifted."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Concord Catering did not have attorneys appear in court, but prosecutors said they would seek to drop charges against that company as well because it too was controlled by Prigozhin and “based on the likelihood that its approach to litigation would be the same as Concord.” Prosecutors vowed to continue to pursue their case against the 13 Russians who were named in Mueller's indictment, along with the troll farm that Concord was alleged to have funded, the Internet Research Agency.

House lawmakers approved a revamped multibillion-dollar coronavirus relief package Monday that was initially passed over the early morning hours of the weekend after negotiations between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Trump administration. Lawmakers OK'd the measure containing technical corrections via unanimous consent. The Senate is expected to take up the legislation Tuesday. Senators will have to approve both plans to avoid sending the fixed bill back to the House. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, expressed reservations about the legislation and initially threatened to block it over what he said were harmful impacts to small businesses. In the end, he didn't object. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin will meet with Senate Republicans for lunch Tuesday afternoon to discuss the next steps. The bill initially passed 363-40 in the early hours on Saturday. It includes paid emergency leave with two weeks of paid sick leave and up to three months of paid family and medical leave. The legislation came after Republicans raised concerns over its impact on small businesses, increased spending on Medicaid and language not included that prevents federal funds from being used for abortions. In an effort to get skeptical House GOP members on board, President Trump threw his support toward the package after some language was changed. Trump is also calling for a payroll tax holiday to give economic relief to Americans. That provision was not included in the bill. Hours before the first version of the bill passed, Trump declared a national emergency over the pandemic and announced partnerships with several companies to expand coronavirus testing.

"                          New rule would make it easier to deny green cards for immigrants getting government assistance; USCIS acting director Ken Cuccinelli weighs in. Immigrants who get tested or treated for the coronavirus will not be penalized when applying for citizenship under a public charge rule that restricts green cards for those who use taxpayer-funded services. In a statement, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said that it is encouraging anyone with symptoms of the COVID-19 to seek medical treatment. ""Such treatment or preventive services will not negatively affect any alien as part of a future Public Charge analysis,"" the agency said. ""To address the possibility that some aliens impacted by COVID-19 may be hesitant to seek necessary medical treatment or preventive services, USCIS will neither consider testing, treatment, nor preventative care (including vaccines, if a vaccine becomes available) related to COVID-19 as part of a public charge inadmissibility determination,"" the agency continued. CANADA CLOSES BORDER TO NONCITIZENS AMID CORONAVIRUS; AMERICANS EXEMPT, TRUDEAU SAYS The public charge rule went into effect last week after the Supreme Court in January allowed the Trump administration to enforce it. The rule essentially restricts immigrants entering the United States if the government believes they will rely on public assistance such as welfare or health care and housing benefits. Lower federal courts had blocked the rule from being enforced before the high court ruling.

"                          Former Vice President Joe Biden's lead in the race for Democratic presidential nomination is becoming political insurmountable, says Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume. Joe Biden has been declared the winner of the Democratic presidential primary in Washington state, giving him victories in five out of six states that voted March 10. After nearly a week of counting votes, the former vice president on Monday held onto a small lead over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders that turned out to be insurmountable. Washington was a state that Sanders had been hoping to win. In 2016, he won more than two-thirds of the delegates from the Washington caucuses over Hillary Clinton. Of the state's 89 pledged delegates, only 31 are allocated based on the statewide result. The remaining 58 are determined based on the results of the state's 10 congressional districts, and those results might not be calculated until the election is certified by the secretary of state's office, which could be as late as March 27. Biden won four other states last Tuesday: Missouri, Mississippi, Michigan and Idaho. Sanders won North Dakota.

"                          Former acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker joins David Asman on 'CAVUTO Live.' The Senate on Monday approved a 77-day extension of the several major surveillance powers under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) that had expired Sunday night -- a temporary compromise reached as some Republicans and Democrats say they will soon push to amend the law to curb the government's monitoring capabilities. The legislation now goes back to the House to sync up, which affords lawmakers more time to pass a bill to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. President Trump, whose former campaign advisor Carter Page was extensively monitored under FISA based on information that has since been proven legally inadequate and in some cases fraudulent, has floated the possibility of vetoing a FISA reauthorization should it come to his desk. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee, on Monday urged an amendment that would prohibit the warrantless collection of web browsing and Internet search history, as well as an amendment establishing independent oversight of the FISA process. “Under this agreement the Senate will have an opportunity to debate whether the government can conduct digital tracking of Americans without a warrant,"" Wyden said. ""Everyone who was concerned about the government collecting their library records, or seeing who you called, should be terrified that the government can grab your Internet browsing history without a warrant. That’s wrong, and my amendment prohibits that practice. And I strongly support my colleagues’ amendment to add independent oversight of FISA, which has had bipartisan support for many years and will finally be considered.” Prior to Monday's voice vote, Reps. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, and Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., urged the Senate to reject the bill in its current form. “If cloture is invoked tonight, it will be the final success of a campaign to prevent any member of Congress from casting any vote for serious FISA reform,"" the represenatives wrote in a letter Monday. They noted that the bill “has not been marked by or passed out of any committee of jurisdiction. ... In other words, there was not an opportunity to amend or cure defects in this bill."" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., supports the legislation and had hoped to pass it last Thursday, but he was forced to delay consideration past the expiration date after Mike Lee, R-Utah, and two other senators — Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Wyden — said they would object. The House legislation, negotiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, would renew several provisions the FBI sees as vital to fighting terrorism but also aim to ensure stricter oversight of how the bureau conducts surveillance. PAUL: MY FISA AMENDMENT WILL KEEP AMERICA SAFE Lee had proposed a deal on the Senate floor Thursday — extension of the current authorities if the Senate would consider several amendments to the House bill that would further limit them. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, speaking on the floor for McConnell, objected to that deal, saying the Senate should instead pass the House bill.       Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has pushed for FISA reforms. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)       “We’re not a rubberstamp for the House of Representatives,"" Lee said. ""We’re certainly not a rubber stamp for the Deep State."" On Monday, McConnell killed a procedural vote on the House FISA bill and teed up debate on a package of amendments from Lee and Paul, among others. ""We shouldn’t have to wait until the moment when we’re on the eve of the expiration of some important legislation and where we have to wait for the president of the United States to weigh in and lean in,” Lee said. “From time to time, laws require revision and review and reform. That always necessarily requires amendments.” Added Paul: ""They can do it the easy way or the hard way. The easy way is that they allow debate."" FISA COURT ORDERS REFORMS -- BUT LEAVES OUT KEY MYSTERY PLAYER The House legislation updates the three expiring surveillance provisions, including one that permits the FBI to obtain court orders to collect business records on subjects in national security investigations. Another, known as the “roving wiretap” provision, permits surveillance on subjects even after they’ve changed phones. The third allows agents to monitor subjects who don’t have ties to international terrorism organizations. ""We’re certainly not a rubber stamp for the Deep State."" The House legislation, passed Wednesday, is a compromise that reflects angst in both parties about the way the surveillance powers have been used, but also a reluctance to strip those powers from the government's arsenal. Republicans and Democrats in the House broadly agreed that they did not want civil liberties sacrificed in efforts to thwart terrorism and other crimes. In addition, Republicans had been aggressively seeking changes to the law since the Justice Department's investigation into Trump's campaign and Russia, while many Democrats already had concerns about government surveillance. FISC SLAMS FBI, SAYS 'FREQUENCY' OF ERRORS AND INACCURACIES CALLS INTO QUESTION PREVIOUS FISA WARRANT APPLICATIONS At the behest of those Republicans, the House compromise takes aim at some of the missteps the Justice Department has acknowledged making during the Russia investigation. Applications under FISA to eavesdrop on a former Trump campaign aide were riddled with omissions and missteps, according to a scathing inspector general report. The measure would require that officers responsible for FISA applications certify that the department has been advised of any information that could undercut or contradict the premise of the surveillance.       Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, successfully secured a deal for debate on FISA amendments.      (AP) In the Russia investigation, some of the information the FBI omitted from its applications cut against the idea that former Trump adviser Carter Page was a Russian agent, the watchdog found. In one case, an FBI lawyer falsified an email from the CIA that was later submitted to the FISA court, making Page's contacts with Russians seem unreported and nefarious. Page has denied that and was never charged with wrongdoing. The bill also would institute criminal penalties and other sanctions for making false statements to the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which issues warrants to the FBI to eavesdrop on people it has probable cause to believe are agents of a foreign power. It would require the attorney general to approve in writing of an investigation if the target of the surveillance is a federal candidate or official. FORMER FBI LAWYER LISA PAGE SUES FBI AND DOJ, SAYS SHE NEEDS 'COST OF THERAPY' REIMBURSED AFTER TRUMP MOCKED HER BIAS Attorney General William Barr was involved in the negotiations with the White House and Congress, and he said Wednesday that he supports the bill. “It is of the utmost important that the Department’s attorneys and investigators always work in a manner consistent with the highest professional standards, and this overall package will help ensure the integrity of the FISA process and protect against future abuses going forward,"" Barr said. But Barr's support does not guarantee that Trump is on board. The president kept Congress guessing with a Thursday tweet that did not indicate how he would act. “Many Republican Senators want me to Veto the FISA Bill until we find out what led to, and happened with, the illegal attempted “coup” of the duly elected President of the United States, and others!,” Trump tweeted, referring to the FBI's Russia investigation.

"                          The Trump Administration's response to coronavirus has been criticized by both Democratic Presidential candidates. Here is how former VP Joe Biden would fight the disease officially known as COVID-19. ""No more, no new fracking."" Those five words spoken by former Vice President Joe Biden during Sunday night's Democratic presidential debate brought on renewed attacks against him from the left -- namely Bernie Sanders endorser Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. -- as well as from the right. And the pushback on the primary front-runner's fracking statement was particularly stiff in his natural gas–reliant home state of Pennsylvania. ""The calls for a moratorium on fracking by presidential candidates are misguided and show no understanding of where energy and important consumer and medical products come from, and how important they are to our lives,"" Pennsylvania Independent Oil & Gas Association President Daniel J. Weaver said in a statement to Fox News.       This Jan. 17, 2013 file photo shows a fracking site in New Milford, Pa.      (AP) SANDERS ATTACKS BIDEN AS ONE-ON-ONE DEBATE TURNS PERSONAL: 'DON'T LAUGH, JOE' From the left, Ocasio-Cortez criticized Biden on Twitter overnight for not calling for an outright ban on fracking, but seemingly trying to make it sound like he is. ""Don't say you support a fracking ban when you don't,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""This is basic. The truth matters."" The fracking issue is just a snapshot of the political balancing act facing Biden as he tries to unite the Democratic Party -- including ardent Sanders supporters -- while also appealing to moderates and winning in Rust Belt states like Pennsylvania that went for Trump in 2016. While Biden does not call for an outright ban on fracking like Sanders does, he does advocate, on his campaign website, ""banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters."" Fox News reached out to the Biden campaign for comment and to clarify that his Sunday statement did not signify a policy shift but did not immediately receive a response. The Washington Examiner, however, reported that the campaign asserted that Biden was simply stating what has been his policy all along. ED ROLLINS: DEMOCRATIC DEBATE A SNOOZER FULL OF PANDERING AT A TIME WHEN NATION NEEDS THIS While the RealClearPolitics average of polls shows Biden beating Trump head-to-head in Pennsylvania in the general election, any restrictions on fracking are unlikely to be popular in states like Pennsylvania, which Biden, if he secures the Democratic presidential nomination, would consider critical in November. ""There is nothing ‘moderate’ about Vice President Biden’s plan to curb and eventually eliminate fracking. It’s just a ban by another name,"" Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said in a statement to Fox News on Monday. BIDEN UP 20 POINTS OVER SANDERS IN ARIZONA ON EVE OF PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY: POLL He added: ""The end result of the plans offered by Vice President Biden and Senator Sanders is the same: devastation for Pennsylvania’s economy, tens of thousands of workers losing their jobs, higher home heating costs for Pennsylvania families, higher CO2 emissions, and our trading partners switching to coal for electricity production or depending on hostile authoritarian regimes, like Russia’s, for natural gas."" Rep. Fred Keller, R-Pa., also addressed Biden's moratorium on fracking and Sanders' proposal for an outright ban on fracking. ""Vice President Biden and Senator Sanders’ continued absurd and dangerous attack on fracking shows they are not only out of touch with reality, but out of touch with hardworking Americans who have benefited from our robust energy economy,"" Keller said Monday. ""Proposals like this would eliminate hundreds of thousands of good-paying blue collar jobs and guarantee that Donald Trump wins states like Pennsylvania and ultimately the presidency."" BIDEN'S CONCESSIONS: HOW EX-VP HAS SHIFTED COURSE IN BID TO WOO LEFT Biden, for his part, has touted his climate record as a member of the Obama administration in pleas for Democrats to back a candidate with a proven record of getting environmental reforms done as he makes his pitch to be the sensible, effective choice in the primary. ""$90 billion in clean energy funding. A huge reduction in the cost of solar so that we'll never build another coal plant again,"" Biden tweeted Sunday night. ""I did that. Bernie watched."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Several large states including Florida are expected to vote Tuesday as Biden looks to grow his lead in the primary race, which has only become larger since his romp on Super Tuesday that saw him take wins in 10 different states. Pennsylvania, along with five other states in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast, are scheduled to vote in the Democratic primary on April 28, but it is unclear whether they will be forced to move back their elections because of the coronavirus pandemic.

"                          Ellison Barber reports from Columbus, Ohio with a recap of what the Democrat candidates said about coronavirus. No candidates in sight – no campaigning – and no canvassing. Welcome to the first presidential primary during a pandemic in modern times. Voters in three states will briefly head to the polls with trepidation on Tuesday - with the country facing an unprecedented crisis as the coronavirus has forced most Americans to self-isolate in their homes in hopes of stemming the spread of the outbreak. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW On primary eve – Ohio’s governor used an emergency order to postpone his state’s contest after the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) urged against any gatherings nationwide of 50 people or more. “We cannot conduct this election tomorrow,” Gov. Mike DeWine stressed. While the polls will be closed in Ohio, contests in Arizona, Florida, and Illinois – will go forward on Tuesday.  And that could give Democratic presidential nomination front-runner Joe Biden a chance to deliver a potential knockout blow to Sen. Bernie Sanders – who’s fighting to avoid elimination from the White House race. “This primary is far from over,” Sanders stressed in an email to supporters on the eve of the March 17 contests. But in reality – the progressive senator from Vermont who’s making his second straight bid for the Democratic nomination is watching his window fast close. The self-described democratic-socialist was the front-runner in the race for much of February – thanks to a partial victory in Iowa’s caucuses, an outright win in New Hampshire’s primary, and a shellacking of the rest of the Democratic field of contenders in Nevada’s caucuses. But over the last two and a half weeks, Sanders has watched Joe Biden zoom past him in the race for the presidential nomination. Following a landslide win in South Carolina’s primary and sweeping victories in the coast-to-coast Super Tuesday states as well as last week’s mini Super Tuesday, the former vice president cemented his position as the unrivaled front-runner and has taken a commanding lead over Sanders in the all-important race for convention delegates. At the same time, Biden’s seen a tidal wave of support and endorsements from current and former members of Congress, governors and state lawmakers and party rainmakers – as centrists, moderates, and the party establishment have all coalesced around the former vice president in hopes that they’ve found the contender who can take out President Trump in Novembers general election. The public opinion polls in all four states voting Tuesday indicate Biden enjoying large double-digit leads. And Sanders lost all four of the states four years ago to eventual 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton. PRIMARY PRIMER: PAST FLORIDA WINNERS With 219 pledged delegates at stake, Florida’s the biggest prize. Illinois has 155 delegates up for grabs, followed by Ohio at 136 and Arizona with 67. While Sanders scored points at Sunday night’s Democratic presidential nomination debate – he didn’t deliver a knockout blow to Biden that was needed to change the primary narrative that the independent senator’s living on borrowed time. If Tuesday’s primaries deliver another round of decisive victories by Biden, the chorus of calls for Sanders to step aside will grow louder. But Biden will still be short of the 1,991 pledged delegates needed to clinch the nomination. And with the primary calendar grinding to a halt after Tuesday's contests due to the coronavirus pandemic - there’s the possibility that Sanders could stay alive in a race that will be frozen in time.

"                          With many measures being taken to protect our physical health during the COVID-19 outbreak, our mental health becomes just as important. Here are some ways of coping with the increase in social isolation in response to the outbreak. We are all being tested, our political leaders most of all. As people and their neighborhoods grapple with shuttered schools, restaurants, churches and theaters, as well as bedlam conditions in grocery stores with depleted shelves, they would like to know their elected officials are working on plans to minimize the danger and the damage. As Wall Street had to halt trading yesterday for the third time in two weeks during another massive selloff, people want to know that there are strenuous efforts to stabilize the markets and the economy. NEW NORMAL: TOM HANKS, NBA FREEZE, STOCK SLIDE AND CONFUSION In a time of such high anxiety, the actions of Donald Trump, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, in a campaign that’s essentially been swallowed by the coronavirus, are illuminating. The most telling moment in the Democratic debate, held in a CNN Washington studio with no audience, was at the start. Biden projected empathy: “First of all, my heart goes out to those who have already lost someone and those who are suffering from the virus.  And this is bigger than any one of us.” Bernie attacked Trump: ""The first thing we’ve got to do, whether or not I’m president is to shut this president up right now because he is undermining the doctors and scientists who are trying to help the American people.” Biden, in vice-presidential fashion, said he’d call a meeting in the Situation Room. Sanders, in democratic socialist fashion, kept turning questions into a pitch for ""Medicare-for-All"" and attacks on dysfunctional insurers and greedy drugmakers. It was as though he had simply updated his talking points for the last year to reflect the virus crisis. And both candidates made unrealistic promises on the economic front. Biden: “No one loses their home, no one loses their paycheck.” Sanders: “No one is going to suffer...If you lose your job, you’ll be made whole.” Depending on the magnitude of the virus, that may simply be impossible. How would government determine who lost a job because of the virus as opposed to an overall recession? And where would the replacement jobs come from? The most heated exchange -- it was so, well, senatorial -- came when the two white-haired warriors battled over the Simpson-Bowles commission of 2010. Bernie was using it to show that Joe once considered (but never actually voted for) cuts to Social Security, because any deficit-reduction effort has to rein in entitlement spending in some fashion. Guys, we’re in a severe crisis. Nobody cares about a forgotten fight from a decade ago. Biden “won” because he remained sharp for two hours and Bernie, knowing he’s trailing badly, didn’t try to bloody him. Now they’re back to a virtual campaign both defined and hamstrung by the virus. As for Trump, there’s little question he’s improved his performance by taking the crisis more seriously and unveiling daily briefings where he speaks at the outset and then turns things over to Mike Pence, followed by Anthony Fauci and assorted medical experts. There’s also little question that our country lost valuable time as Trump minimized the crisis and failed to resolve the crucial delays in testing. SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES What’s puzzling now, as the world’s attention is focused on one issue, is why the president is picking other fights. He went after Hillary Clinton, his opponent of more than three years ago, cheering on a “great job” by Judicial Watch, which is seeking to depose her on the private e-mail survey and Benghazi. “Potentially a treasure trove,” Trump tweeted. He went after Chuck Schumer, saying, “Can’t believe they are not going after Schumer for the threats he made to our cherished United States Supreme Court, and our two great Justices...Pathetic!” The senator’s threat that Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch would pay a price on abortion was dumb, but that story played out weeks ago. Trump went after “the fake and corrupt news” for saying he exaggerated the status of a Google project to develop a website to aid virus testing. He then tweeted the same company statement that journalists have been citing, which says the effort is in the “early stages of development” and for now aimed only at the San Francisco area. And Trump said again that Mike Flynn had been treated unfairly and might get a “full pardon”--despite the fact that his former aide pleaded guilty to lying. We all know that the president loves to punch and counterpunch his political detractors. But it would be better for the country if, for now at least, he only had one target.

"                          With growing fears of the coronavirus pandemic, states have begun to respond by postponing their primary elections. Here are the states that have begun to take these initial steps. The spreading coronavirus outbreak has shut down more and more of American life — including schools, sporting events, bars, and now even elections. Multiple states have either announced they are postponing their presidential primary elections due to concerns about the novel coronavirus or made clear they are considering it. This comes after top election officials in Arizona, Florida, Ohio and Illinois issued a statement Friday saying they would go on with their Tuesday, March 17 elections, writing, ""Americans have participated in elections during challenging times in the past ... we are confident that voters in our states can safely and securely cast their ballots in this election."" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine backtracked Monday, announcing that his state health director will close down polls ""as a health emergency."" And Sunday night, in an interview after the CNN presidential debate that was held in a closed-off studio rather than in a hall with a live audience, presidential candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders hinted that it could be worth moving primary elections to protect against the coronavirus. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW TRAVELING DURING THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK: WHAT TO PACK ""I would hope that governors listen to the public health experts and what they are saying is … we don’t want gatherings of more than 50 people,” Sanders said. “I’m thinking about some of the elderly people sitting behind the desks, registering people and doing all that stuff. Does that make sense? I’m not sure it does."" Here are the states that are putting off their presidential primary elections: Louisiana Louisiana became the first state to postpone a primary or caucus on Friday, with Gov. John Bel Edwards signing an executive order to move the April 4 election to late June. ""Today I have certified that a state of emergency exists and requested that the governor issue an executive order postponing the elections this spring. We have requested postponing the April 4 primary election until June 20 and postponing the May 9 general election until July 25,"" Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin said. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES UNDER SIEGE AMID CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE: REPORT Christina Stephens, a spokeswoman for Edwards, said the move was to prevent further person-to-person transmission of the virus in Louisiana. ""We are experiencing community spread of coronavirus in Louisiana and the governor is taking decisive action to slow its progress,"" she said. Georgia Georgia also moved its elections from March 24 to May 19 on Saturday after Gov. Brian Kemp declared a state of emergency. LINDSAY GRAHAM TESTS NEGATIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS AS CONGRESS WORKS TO KEEP MEMBERS, STAFF HEALTHY ""Events are moving rapidly and my highest priority is protecting the health of our poll workers, their families, and the community at large,"" said Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Ohio Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine asked a judge Monday to allow his state to postpone its election, originally scheduled for Tuesday, March 17, to June 2. ""We cannot conduct this election tomorrow,” he stressed in an announcement on Monday. After the judge ruled that the election would have to go forward, DeWine announced that he would prevent polls from opening anyway, with his state health director closing down polls ""as a health emergency."" DEMOCRACY 2020 DIGEST: OHIO TO ORDER POLLS CLOSED OVER CORONAVIRUS 'EMERGENCY,' GOVERNOR SAYS DeWine said that the state's in-person voting would not conform with CDC guidelines for preventing the spread of the coronavirus, and vowed to find a way to hold a ""free and fair"" election without putting voters' health at risk. ""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,"" DeWine said in a statement. ""As such, Health Director Dr. Amy Acton will order the polls closed as a health emergency. While the polls will be closed tomorrow, Secretary of State Frank LaRose will seek a remedy through the courts to extend voting options so that every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity."" Officials in the other three states slated to have elections Tuesday -- Arizona, Florida and Illinois -- confirmed Monday that they would still go through with their plans. Kentucky On recommendation from Kentucky Secretary of State Michael G. Adams, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear pushed back that state's primary from May 19 to June 23. ""I never would have imagined sitting here discussing this with you, but these are unprecedented times,"" Adams said in a video posted to Twitter. ""And we Kentuckians are having to change the way we do things on all fronts. Kentucky law allows the secretary of state and the governor to jointly act to change the time of an election due to a state of emergency."" He continued: ""Postponing the primary was not an easy decision, but the Republican secretary of state and Democratic governor agree, and so do county clerks of both parties, and they are our frontline election administrators. My hope is that this delay will allow us to have a normal election. Even if not, this delay will allow me, the state board of elections and our county clerks time to assess what changes we must make to ensure a successful primary election. There could be more changes, but this was a first step to buy is time and keep our citizens as safe as possible. We'll get through this."" Kentucky was originally slated to have one of the latest primaries of any state, with only five states and Washington, D.C., voting after it. This move by Kentucky throws into question almost the entire 2020 primary calendar, especially after President Trump's comments Monday that the coronavirus pandemic could last until July or August in the United States. Puerto Rico Though it is not a state, Puerto Rico holds primaries for both parties. The Puerto Rico Republican primary already took place on March 8, but the Puerto Rico Democratic Party last week requested that the state delay its Democratic primary, which was scheduled for March 29.

"                          President Trump gives coronavirus update from White House. With Congress, the Supreme Court, sports leagues, schools and many businesses and companies across America shutting down, only time will tell if we are being appropriately cautious or engaging in a hysterical overreaction to the coronavirus. But for those imaginative reporters who see a Russian lurking behind every tree and keep asking me if President Trump can use this pandemic as an excuse to delay the 2020 presidential election, the answer is “no.” Under our Constitution, the executive branch has no authority whatsoever to delay, reschedule or otherwise change the federal election in November, much less any of the remaining state primaries. On the other hand, Congress and the states do have that authority. Congress has no authority over state elections or party primaries other than the requirements under federal statutes like the Voting Rights Act and various constitutional amendments that prohibit states from discriminating or limiting access to the voting process. But when it comes to setting the dates for political party primaries or general elections for state officials, including presidential primaries, or how you are able to vote (in-person or by mail), the federal government has no power to dictate the time, place or manner of those state elections. DR. QANTA AHMED: BORDERS MATTER IN CORONAVIRUS FIGHT – TRAVEL BANS BOUGHT US PRECIOUS TIME State governments can certainly change the dates of their presidential primaries or whatever other state primaries they are holding.  In some states such as Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia, governors are provided with emergency authority to take such actions without the approval of their state legislatures. In Florida, for example, the governor has the power under state law to suspend or delay an election by issuing an executive order declaring a state of emergency, although a new election must then be held within 10 days or as soon as practicable thereafter. That actually happened in New York because of the 9/11 attacks. New York was holding a primary on Sept. 11, 2001. In fact, a political unknown named Michael Bloomberg was running in the GOP primary for mayor of New York City. Polls opened at 6 a.m. but voting was suspended statewide by Gov. George Pataki after the attacks. A new election was held two weeks later. State governments can certainly change the dates of their presidential primaries or whatever other state primaries they are holding.  But the federal government cannot change the date of such state primaries. Given that all 50 states and the District of Columbia allow voters to vote with absentee ballots, which can be easily obtained, completed and mailed without anyone ever leaving their house, there seems little reason to do so. The cancellation and delay in the New York primary because of the 9/11 attacks on Election Day itself was an extraordinary event necessitated by unique and tragic circumstances. That is not the current situation. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Congress does have the authority under Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution to step in and change state laws and rules when it wants to with regard to the “Times, Places and Manner” of congressional elections. Congress has set the date for election of all members of the House of Representatives on the “Tuesday next after the 1st Monday in November, in every even numbered year.” Federal law sets the same day for the election of U.S. senators whose terms are expiring. Similarly, under Article II, Section 1, Congress has the authority to set the “Time of chusing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes, which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.” Since it is the Electoral College that selects our president, Congress has the power to determine when our general federal election occurs where voters vote for slates of presidential electors in their respective states. Congress has set the date for that vote on the same day as congressional elections, the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Those electors chosen by voters then cast their votes for president on the “first Monday after the second Wednesday in December.” None of these federal statutes has any provision allowing the president or any other executive branch official or agency to change the date of the election even in an emergency, whether it is the threat of a disease like the coronavirus or a terrorist attack. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP On the other hand, Congress does have the authority to do so if both the House and the Senate pass an amendment to these laws and the president signs it into law. That amendment could either change the date of the election or delegate to the president the ability to change the date under certain emergency conditions, similar to the authority some governors are given under state laws. But without that happening – and it is highly unlikely given the fact that neither party controls both houses of Congress – we are having a federal election on Nov. 3 no matter what happens with the coronavirus.

"                          Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin explains what the emergency coronavirus bill includes and when we can expect the big economic recovery package White House officials and congressional lawmakers are signaling they will attempt to push through a third coronavirus spending package worth hundreds of billions of dollars even as the Senate works to move along the more modest second relief bill that focuses on leave for workers and expedited testing for the disease officially known as COVID-19. Fox News has learned that the White House specifically is pushing an $850 billion stimulus, largely in the form of tax relief measures. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW Roughly $500 billion of this would be tied to a payroll tax cut, while $250 billion would come in the form of Small Business Administration loans and another $58 billion would be directed to the airline industry, among other measures. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will attend the Senate GOP's weekly policy lunch Tuesday -- which will take place in a larger room that it usually does so the senators can practice social distancing -- to discuss the details of the comprehensive coronavirus proposal from the White House. ""I’m not going to comment on the numbers now. But it’s a big number,"" Mnuchin told reporters Monday night. The Washington Post first reported Tuesday morning that Mnuchin's proposal would come with the $850 billion price tag. The Post, citing anonymous sources, reported that Mnuchin's proposal would focus mainly on putting cash in the hands of individuals and businesses. CAN NEWBORN BABIES CONTRACT CORONAVIRUS AND PASS IT TO OTHERS? Meanwhile, Senate Democrats will hold their weekly lunch via conference call instead, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer likely going over the details of a huge $750 billion proposal he announced Monday ""to wage war against coronavirus and the economic crisis facing Americans."" ""As early as tomorrow, I will present a series of proposals to Congressional appropriators that Senate Democrats believe should be part of the next bill to address the coronavirus,"" Schumer said in floor remarks Monday. ""In consultation with the ranking members of the committees of jurisdiction, we are proposing an immediate and initial infusion of at least $750 billion to wage war against COVID-19 and the economic crisis it is now causing."" BRIT HUME: TRUMP'S CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE A 'MIXED BAG,' NOT AT 10 OUT OF 10 Following President Trump's signing of an initial coronavirus-related spending bill worth $8.3 billion last week, the House of Representatives okayed a second bill early Saturday morning that it adjusted Monday to correct technical errors. The Senate is expected to act on the House proposal Tuesday and will need to approve both the original bill and the correction to avoid sending the legislation back to the House, which has a significant portion of its members out of town on their previously scheduled district work period. Schumer said that his proposal will include expanded unemployment insurance and Medicaid funding, address strained capacity at hospitals, provide urgent assistance to small businesses, assist schools in transitioning to remote learning as more and more states close down their public schools for the foreseeable future, among other measures. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., backed Schumer's call for a $750 billion arsenal to battle the coronavirus and its economic effects in an op-ed for CNN Monday. MNUCHIN SAYS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION NOT PUSHING BAILOuTS AS HE SEEKS TO CALM ECONOMIC ANXIETIES ON FOX NEWS SUNDAY ""The US is heading toward a recession, and Speaker Pelosi has already announced plans for an additional emergency response package,"" she wrote. ""This is the right approach. We must act quickly to enact a major fiscal stimulus package that wards off economic disaster."" It is unclear what exactly will be in Mnuchin's proposal to Senate Republicans but there is a chance there could be significant overlap with Schumer's ideas -- Mnuchin has been the White House's point person in negotiating with congressional Democrats and spoke with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi more than 20 times on Friday as she and the Trump administration hashed out the chamber's initial version of the second coronavirus deal. In an interview with Chris Wallace on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Mnuchin pitched ""a big stimulus program because we need to help American workers now."" The Treasury secretary made clear, however, that he and the president are not asking for a bailout. ""If you're providing liquidity to good businesses that just need liquidity for 3 to 6 months,"" he said, ""that's not a bailout."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Mnuchin continued: ""Whatever we need, we are gonna get from Congress."" Other lawmakers have chimed in with ideas for how to combat the coronavirus and help Americans who are harmed by the virtual economic shutdown it is triggering. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, Monday proposed, among other things, providing every American with a $1,000 check to cover expenses they may incur due to layoffs, forced leave or other coronavirus-related expenses. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, came out with a similar proposal last week, introduced in a nonbinding House resolution, to provide each American with a monthly $1,000 payment until the coronavirus threat is over. She termed it a ""temporary universal basic payment."" Both her proposal and Romney's appear similar to former Democratic presidential contender Andrew Yang's universal basic income (UBI) idea, but are distinguished from it mainly because their ideas are temporary, stopgap measures.

Mike DeWine stressed. While the polls will be closed in Ohio, contests in Arizona, Florida, and Illinois – will go forward on Tuesday.  And that could give Democratic presidential nomination front-runner Joe Biden a chance to deliver a potential knockout blow to Sen. Bernie Sanders – who’s fighting to avoid elimination from the White House race. “This primary is far from over,” Sanders stressed in an email to supporters on the eve of the March 17 contests. But in reality – the progressive senator from Vermont who’s making his second straight bid for the Democratic nomination is watching his window fast close. The self-described democratic-socialist was the front-runner in the race for much of February – thanks to a partial victory in Iowa’s caucuses, an outright win in New Hampshire’s primary, and a shellacking of the rest of the Democratic field of contenders in Nevada’s caucuses. But over the last two and a half weeks, Sanders has watched Joe Biden zoom past him in the race for the presidential nomination. Following a landslide win in South Carolina’s primary and sweeping victories in the coast-to-coast Super Tuesday states as well as last week’s mini Super Tuesday, the former vice president cemented his position as the unrivaled front-runner and has taken a commanding lead over Sanders in the all-important race for convention delegates. At the same time, Biden’s seen a tidal wave of support and endorsements from current and former members of Congress, governors and state lawmakers and party rainmakers – as centrists, moderates, and the party establishment have all coalesced around the former vice president in hopes that they’ve found the contender who can take out President Trump in Novembers general election. The public opinion polls in all the states voting Tuesday indicate Biden enjoying large double-digit leads. And Sanders lost all four of them four years ago to eventual 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton. PRIMARY PRIMER: PAST FLORIDA WINNERS With 219 pledged delegates at stake, Florida’s the biggest prize. Illinois has 155 delegates up for grabs, and Arizona 67. Ohio, which is postponing it's primaray day voting, has 136 pledged delegates. While Sanders scored points at Sunday night’s Democratic presidential nomination debate – he didn’t deliver a knockout blow to Biden that was needed to change the primary narrative that the independent senator’s living on borrowed time. If Tuesday’s primaries deliver another round of decisive victories by Biden, the chorus of calls for Sanders to step aside will grow louder. But Biden will still be short of the 1,991 pledged delegates needed to clinch the nomination. And with the primary calendar grinding to a halt after Tuesday's contests due to the coronavirus pandemic - there’s the possibility that Sanders could stay alive in a race that will be frozen in time.

"                          The Trump campaign files a libel lawsuit against New York Times for the paper's March 27, 2019 op-ed titled ‘The Real Trump-Russia Quid Pro Quo;’ reaction and analysis from ‘Media Buzz’ host Howard Kurtz. In a striking and unexpected abandonment of a once-heralded prosecution initiated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, the Justice Department moved Monday to drop charges against two Russian companies that were accused of funding a social media meme campaign to further their “strategic goal to sow discord in the U.S. political system, including the 2016 presidential election.” Late Monday, with jury selection in the case set to begin in just two weeks, a federal judge granted the DOJ's motion to kill the prosecution for several counts of conspiring to defraud U.S. agencies tasked with combating election interference. The government acknowledged the Russian companies were never likely to actually face punishment anyway and cited possible national security risks with going forward to trial. Concord Management and Consulting LLC and Concord Catering were among three companies and 13 individuals charged in February 2018 by Mueller. Their alleged criminal effort included social media postings and campaigns aimed at dividing American public opinion and sowing discord in the electorate, officials said, although no impact on voters was ever demonstrated. Of the 13 Russians and three Russian companies charged by Mueller in the social media disinformation effort, Concord was the sole defendant to enter an appearance in Washington’s federal court and contest and the allegations. Mueller's 37-page indictment said the actions detailed by prosecutors dated back to 2014. (Mueller later brought separate charges in the summer of 2018 against other entities related to a hack of Democrats' emails.) READ THE DOJ'S MOTION TO DROP CHARGES President Trump noted that no Russian collusion with his campaign was ever proven, and Republicans and even left-of-center commenators argued that Russian disinformation was mostly irrelevant, given that social media and other platforms are already rife with inaccuracies. ""Before a pandemic, there was a time when we were relentlessly told to fear Russian social media accounts,"" mused journalist Aaron Mate on Monday. ""Their juvenile memes not only elected Trump, but also 'sowed chaos.' When Mueller indicted 13 Russians over it, he was hailed as a hero. Well, DOJ just dropped the case."" Various media outlets had hyped the indictment, with NPR calling the Russians' activities an ""attack"" on democracy.  ""For me, personally, hearing these charges and hearing what they were charging these Russians for -- it was the first time that I felt like finally, finally, for the first time since we realized all this was happened, finally, it feels like someone is defending us,"" MSNBC host Rachel Maddow said at the time, seemingly holding back tears. Concord is controlled by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a wealthy businessman known as “Putin’s chef” for his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. He has been hit with U.S. sanctions over Russian interference in the 2016 election and is charged alongside his company in the indictment brought by Mueller.

(Sergei Ilnitsky/Pool Photo via AP, File)       The company, with the help of a high-powered law firm, filed a series of motions over the last two years, including to dismiss charges and to exclude certain evidence from the case. In January 2019, prosecutors said confidential material from the Russia investigation, which had been handed over to defense attorneys for Concord, was altered and released online as part of a disinformation campaign to discredit the special counsel's Russia investigation. READ MUELLER'S INITIAL INDICTMENT The files surfaced online in a link posted by a pro-Russia Twitter account. But the Justice Department stopped short of accusing Concord of leaking the material. Still, they argued that the company’s request to have sensitive new evidence sent to Russia “unreasonably risks the national security interests of the United States.”       Special Counsel Robert Mueller announced the prosecution of Russian trolls in 2018; that prosecution is now dropped. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File)       Some of the court appearances in the case have been unusually contentious, with the federal judge overseeing it chastising a lawyer for the company, Eric Dubelier, for references in court filings to Looney Tunes and the 1978 raunchy comedy “Animal House” to criticize the Mueller investigation. “I’ll say it plain and simply: Knock it off,” U.S District Judge Dabney Friedrich told Dubelier at a January 2019 court appearance. Dubelier, who has referred to the case as involving a “made up” crime, has made allegations of prosecutorial misconduct and even once accused the judge of bias. JUDGE SLAMS DNC OVER LAWSUIT AGAINST TRUMP CAMP, SAYS NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION ""The real Department of Justice"" never would have brought the case,"" Dubelier said at one 2018 hearing. At another point, he curtly rejected a DOJ summons, saying prosecutors ""are already behaving in a manner that is inconsistent with the practices of the DOJ."" He also accused the DOJ of having ""indicted the proverbial ham sandwich."" And, the Twitter user Techno Fog observed that Dubelier also flatly accused one of Mueller's prosecutors of being a liar. But with the case approaching trial, prosecutors beat a hasty retreat, and said they had to weigh the risk of potentially exposing sensitive national security information against the benefits of continuing with the case against a company that likely wouldn’t face any significant punishment in the United States. In the court filing on Monday, prosecutors said Concord had been “eager and aggressive in using the judicial system to gather information about how the United States detects and prevents foreign election interference.” “In short, Concord has demonstrated its intent to reap the benefits of the Court’s jurisdiction while positioning itself to evade any real obligations or responsibility,” prosecutors wrote in Monday’s filing. “It is no longer in the best interests of justice or the country’s national security to continue this prosecution."" At the same time, Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers and U.S. Attorney for Washington Timothy Shea defended the initial indictment. ""There is a substantial federal interest in defending American democratic institutions, exposing those who endeavor to criminally interfere with them, and holding them accountable, which is why this prosecution was properly commenced in the first place,"" the prosecutors said. They added: ""In light of the defendant’s conduct, however, its ephemeral presence and immunity to just punishment, the risk of exposure of law enforcement’s tools and techniques, and the post-indictment change in the proof available at trial, the balance of equities has shifted."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Concord Catering did not have attorneys appear in court, but prosecutors said they would seek to drop charges against that company as well because it too was controlled by Prigozhin and “based on the likelihood that its approach to litigation would be the same as Concord.” Prosecutors vowed to continue to pursue their case against the 13 Russians who were named in Mueller's indictment, along with the troll farm that Concord was alleged to have funded, the Internet Research Agency.

"                          Dr. Marc Siegel answers questions from 'Fox &amp; Friends' viewers. The top lawyer for Democrats during the House impeachment inquiry has confirmed that he tested positive for the novel coronavirus — while simultaneously accusing the Trump administration of being “shockingly unprepared” for the pandemic. Daniel Goldman, who conducted much of the questioning for House Intelligence Committee Democrats during the impeachment inquiry last year, tweeted Sunday that he has COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. FOREIGN DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN ON FAKE NATIONAL QUARANTINE TRYING TO CAUSE PANIC, TRUMP ADMIN OFFICIALS SAY  “My #COVID19 test came back positive. I want to thank everyone for the outpouring of support. It means a lot to my family and me,” he tweeted. “I am almost back to 100%. I’m lucky enough not to fall in the vulnerable category and, for me, it was just like the flu.” Goldman went on to describe his “difficulty in getting a test despite the exact symptoms and a neg flu test” which he said “underscores how shockingly unprepared this administration is to deal with this pandemic.” “@realDonaldTrump can try to gaslight the American public by repeatedly saying that everyone who needs a test can get one, but that was not true one month ago (when it should have been the case) and it is not true today (when there is no excuse),” Goldman tweeted, noting that his wife, despite having symptoms, was unable to be tested in New York City hospitals unless she was admitted. “Given his stated desire to ‘keep numbers down’ for his political benefit, it is impossible to reach any conclusion other than the President is sacrificing the health of the American public for his own personal interests,” Goldman continued. Trump has been criticized for initially downplaying the outbreak, but on Monday the president struck a more somber and serious tone as he urged Americans to take a range of precautions to curb the spread of the virus. He also defended his administration's response, self-assigning a score of 10 out of 10. “I’d rate it a 10,” Trump said, pointing to an early China travel ban. “I think we’ve done a great job. ... We were very, very early with respect to China and we would have a whole different situation in this country if we didn’t do that.” Last week, Goldman began tweeting about his symptoms, and noting that “unless you have pneumonia and traveled to one of the 5 high-risk countries recently, you can NOT get a #COVID19 test in New York City.” Goldman went to Weill Cornell Hospital in New York City last week and tweeted about the “overflowing ER” while he awaited results for six hours of what he described as “another flu test” and chest x-ray, because he was not “eligible” for the COVID-19 test because his symptoms were “not bad enough to be admitted.” Goldman traveled to Stamford, Conn., a suburb outside of New York City, for a curbside coronavirus test last week, but was told that the results would not come back for four days. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., announced Sunday that a former staffer had tested positive, and that he and his office would follow recommendations of the House attending physician. ""Medical professionals believe that my former staff member likely contracted the virus after leaving the office, but we will still be taking additional precautions over the next few days,"" Schiff said in a statement. ""The former staffer is feeling better and no current staff have reported any flu-like symptoms at this time."" Goldman later publicly tweeted that it was him. Goldman's last day on Capitol Hill was March 6. Meanwhile, Goldman tweeted encouraging the public to ""listen to the experts"" to slow the spread. The World Health Organization (WHO) designated coronavirus, or COVID-19, a pandemic last week. President Trump announced a national emergency on Friday. The president also announced a temporary halt on air travel to the United States from Europe, now including flights from the United Kingdom, but excluding those carrying cargo. The announcement came as major sporting and other events were called off or postponed, businesses across the country instituted telework policies, government buildings and schools shuttered and other disruptions rocked the nation, amid efforts to curb the transmission of the virus. As of Tuesday morning, there were more than 4,660 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States, in 49 states, including Washington, D.C. The U.S., so far, has seen 85 coronavirus-related deaths. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to WHO, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.

"                          Reaction from Arizona GOP chairwoman Dr. Kelli Ward. Kentucky Gov. Andrew Beshear and Secretary of State Michael G. Adams on Monday postponed the state's primary elections, which originally were scheduled for May 19, to June 23 amid concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. The state becomes the latest in a rapidly growing number to put off their primaries, throwing into question the rest of the 2020 election calendar -- even as voters in three states head to the polls Tuesday. ""I never would have imagined sitting here discussing this with you, but these are unprecedented times,"" Adams said in a video posted to Twitter. ""And we Kentuckians are having to change the way we do things on all fronts. Kentucky law allows the secretary of state and the governor to jointly act to change the time of an election due to a state of emergency."" Only five states and Washington, D.C., originally were scheduled to hold primary elections after Kentucky's May 19 date. The move by Beshear, a Democrat, and Adams, a Republican, could be repeated by officials in states with even earlier primaries in the days ahead. ""Postponing the primary was not an easy decision, but the Republican secretary of state and Democratic governor agree, and so do county clerks of both parties, and they are our frontline election administrators,"" Adams said. ""My hope is that this delay will allow us to have a normal election. Even if not, this delay will allow me, the state board of elections and our county clerks time to assess what changes we must make to ensure a successful primary election. There could be more changes, but this was a first step, to buy us time and keep our citizens as safe as possible. We'll get through this."" CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW ARIZONA, ILLINOIS AND FLORIDA PRIMARIES MOVE FORWARD DESPITE COVID-19 FEARS Kentucky's move comes after a lawsuit by Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine earlier Monday to postpone his state's primaries, first scheduled for Tuesday, to June 2. DeWine filed a lawsuit in state court moving to change the election date but it was denied. He later had his state health director Dr. Amy Action order polls closed anyway ""as a health emergency"" and tasked his secretary of state with working in the courts to officially move the election date so Ohioans could have ""free and fair"" elections without the risk of catching the coronavirus. The Ohio Supreme Court, in a ruling without an opinion Tuesday morning, denied a last-second effort to force the state to move ahead with the Tuesday elections, giving further legitimacy to DeWine's 11th-hour maneuver. Arizona, Florida and Illinois will all hold their presidential primary elections as scheduled on Tuesday. Ohio previously had joined with the other three states in committing to hold their elections as scheduled, but DeWine, who has been one of the most active governors in fighting the coronavirus, stepped in. He said there was no way the state could make its polling places comply with federal guidelines for limiting gatherings in such a short timeframe.

Those guidelines included limiting any gatherings to 10 people or fewer, keeping an entire household at home if one person inside tests positive for the coronavirus and washing hands frequently.

"                          Four states will go to the voting booths on March 17. Here’s how many democratic delegates are at stake in each of the states. Democratic voters will head to the polls Tuesday to vote in the party's first set of primaries after voters have the chance to see the last two remaining contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination -- former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders -- go head-to-head in a debate. Biden has taken control of the race after wins in 10 states on Super Tuesday and at least four states last Tuesday. He now holds a significant delegate lead over Sanders in what became essentially a one-on-one race after billionaire Mike Bloomberg and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren exited the race following Super Tuesday. Sanders admitted the March 10 primaries were not a good night for his campaign while saying he would stay in the race for the Democratic nomination on Wednesday. The March 17 races, which award 15 percent of all delegates in the Democratic primary and will bring the number of delegates awarded in the Democratic race to 61 percent of the total delegates available, could be Sanders' last stand.       Democratic voters will head to the polls for the first time Tuesday after seeing Sanders and Biden go head-to-head in a debate.       BIDEN HOLDS MASSIVE LEAD OVER SANDERS IN FLORIDA: POLL Here are the states voting and the delegates at stake on Tuesday, March 17. Arizona There are 67 pledged delegates at stake in Arizona's Democratic presidential primary. The results in Arizona will be an important indicator, as Sanders has typically fared better in western states while Biden has excelled in more diverse states. Arizona, sitting on the U.S. southern border, is both western and diverse. Florida Florida is the biggest prize available on March 17, awarding 219 pledged delegates in all. A diverse swing state, a good performance in Florida will help Sanders or Biden make the case that they are the most electable Democrat to face President Trump in November. Illinois The home state of former President Barack Obama, Illinois will dole out 155 pledged delegates on March 17. Sanders laid some groundwork in Illinois earlier in the primary, visiting the state for three days to Biden's one as of March 11. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Ohio (Postponed) Ohio originally was scheduled to have its primaries on March 17 before Gov. Mike DeWine announced a lawsuit Monday to push back the date to June 2. A judge ruled against DeWine's suit but the governor announced that his state health director would prevent polls from opening anyway and that his secretary of state would work in the courts to set a new election date. ""We cannot conduct this election tomorrow,” he stressed in an announcement on Monday. ""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,"" DeWine said in a statement after the judge had ruled against his suit to postpone the election. ""As such, Health Director Dr. Amy Acton will order the polls closed as a health emergency. While the polls will be closed tomorrow, Secretary of State Frank LaRose will seek a remedy through the courts to extend voting options so that every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity."" The Ohio Supreme Court, in a ruling without an opinion Tuesday morning, denied a last-second effort to force the state to move ahead with the Tuesday elections, giving further legitimacy to DeWine's 11th-hour maneuver. While Ohio only has the third-most delegates of the four March 17 states, a win in the ever-important general election swing state -- whenever it holds its election -- could help Biden make himself seem even more like the inevitable nominee or help Sanders revive his campaign. The state will award 136 total delegates. Fox News' Paul Steinhauser and Ellison Barber contributed to this report.

The development comes not only as Biden moves closer to the nomination but as protesters have disrupted several recent events -- even rushing the stage and prompting staff and family members to intervene to help protect the candidate. PLUG PULLED ON BIDEN 'VIRTUAL TOWN HALL' AFTER TECHNICAL GLITCHES The law enforcement source described a multi-stage approval process, telling Fox News that a candidate first needs to qualify for protection, then request it from a select congressional committee and the Department of Homeland Security. Once approved, the U.S. Secret Service is authorized to protect the individual. Biden's rival for the Democratic nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has not yet had Secret Service protection activated, the source told Fox News. It is rare for official protection to be given to candidates before they officially get their party’s nomination, but the Secret Service makes exceptions based on threats. For example, in 2015, the Secret Service activated 24-hour protection for then-candidate Donald Trump and then-candidate Ben Carson after both received threats; and then-Sen. Barack Obama received protection in 2007, long before he secured the nomination, amid an uptick in threats against him. But former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had Secret Service protection dating back to her days as first lady, and had that protection on the presidential campaign trail in 2016. Biden, as vice president, also had Secret Service protection. While it is unclear, at this point, if the Biden campaign has received any sort of threat, earlier this month, the former vice president had protesters storm the stage during a victory speech. 'LET DAIRY DIE' PROTESTERS STORM STAGE DURING BIDEN SUPER TUESDAY VICTORY SPEECH Two female protesters rushed the stage, shouting: ""Let dairy die."" They held posters reading the same and showing the image of a cow. Dr. Jill Biden, and Biden’s sister, Valerie, attempted to block the protesters from touching the former vice president. Campaign senior adviser Symone Sanders immediately hit the stage, grabbing a protester. The other protester was dragged off the stage by security. Biden continued on with his speech. Sanders tweeted, later, saying: ""I broke a nail. #SuperTuesday""    ",         Biden gets Secret Service protection source,         2020-03-17T100921-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/biden-to-receive-secret-service-protection,Fox
"                          Ellison Barber reports from Columbus, Ohio after in-person voting is postponed. The Ohio Supreme Court, in an early-morning order, declined an 11th-hour request to force the state to move forward with its primary elections that were originally scheduled for Tuesday but postponed on Monday by Gov. Mike DeWine due to the coronavirus threat. The court was responding to a request for a writ of mandamus -- a judicial order that a government official do his or her job a certain way -- and called for arguments from the government on why it could not hold the election with a compressed deadline of 1:30 a.m. Tuesday. It then ruled against granting the writ early Tuesday morning without issuing a full opinion. Three of the seven judges on Ohio's Supreme Court -- DeWine's son, Pat DeWine, and two others who are running for reelection -- declined to participate in the ruling, meaning just a bare majority of the court was even hearing the case. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW MARCH 17 PRIMARIES: HERE ARE THE STATES VOTING AND THE DELEGATES AT STAKE By simply declining to issue a writ of mandamus, the Ohio Supreme Court is not necessarily saying what DeWine is doing is legal or that the lower court that ruled against DeWine on Monday -- prompting DeWine to announce he would close polls anyway -- was wrong. All it is doing is declining to tell DeWine what to do. It is unclear that DeWine would have complied with a writ ordering him to hold the Tuesday elections given his dedication to stopping the coronavirus pandemic in his state and his previous refusal to follow a court order saying the election should go forward. ""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,"" DeWine said after the lower court ruled against him Monday. Secretary of State Frank LaRose defended the decision to postpone the election in Tuesday morning comments. ""There's no question in my mind that the action that the governor took is allowed under the law,"" LaRose said, citing a provision in Ohio law that gives the state health director broad powers to prevent the spread of disease. ""There will be litigation. My team is prepared to argue that. I know that the governor's team is as well."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Nevertheless, the highest court in Ohio has at the very least refused to rule against DeWine, at minimum adding some legal legitimacy to his poll closure. DeWine has asked LaRose to work through the courts to find a solution so that Ohioans can have ""free and fair"" elections without risk of contracting the coronavirus. DeWine originally sought to move the Ohio primary back to June 2, though it is unclear if that will be the end result of what has become a rather messy legal scenario.

"                          Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf joins Laura Ingraham with insight on 'The Ingraham Angle.' President Trump and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo are trading barbs over the coronavirus  response, with the president telling the Democratic governor Tuesday to “keep politics out of it.” “Cuomo wants ‘all states to be treated the same. But all states aren’t the same,” Trump tweeted Tuesday. “Some are being hit hard by the Chinese Virus, some are being hit practically not at all.” CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK SPURS NY, NJ, CT TO SHUT BARS, RESTAURANTS, GYMS Trump added: “New York is a very big ‘hotspot’, West Virginia has, thus far, zero cases.” “Andrew, keep politics out of it…” Trump tweeted. Trump’s post came after he tweeted Monday night about a teleconference he had conducted with governors across the country, saying it went well but claiming Cuomo has to ""do more."" Cuomo, a frequent critic of Trump, fired back Monday night. “I have to do more? No—YOU have to do something!” Cuomo tweeted. “You’re supposed to be the President.” He added: “Happy to do your job, too. Just give me control of the Army Corps of Engineers and I’ll take it from there.” The back-and-forth between Trump and Cuomo comes as the nation is grappling with what was designated last week by the World Health Organization as a global pandemic. As of Tuesday morning, there were more than 4,660 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States, in 49 states, including Washington, D.C. The U.S., so far, has seen 85 coronavirus-related deaths. New York, at this point, is considered the state with the highest number of confirmed cases in the country, with nearly 1,000 individuals having tested positive for the virus. Meanwhile, Trump also slammed Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat who delivered the rebuttal to Trump's State of the Union last month. The governor, whose state is not at this point one of the most impacted, earlier had called on the federal government to do more in response to the pandemic. ""Failing Michigan Governor must work harder and be much more proactive. We are pushing her to get the job done. I stand with Michigan!"" Trump tweeted. He went on to tout the administration's response to coronavirus, and their work with states and localities to halt the spread. ""Federal Government is working very well with the Governors and State officials. Good things will happen! #KILLTHEVIRUS,"" he tweeted. Trump announced a national emergency on Friday. The president also announced a temporary halt on air travel to the United States from Europe, now including flights from the United Kingdom, but excluding those carrying cargo. The announcement came as major sporting and other events were called off or postponed, businesses across the country instituted telework policies, government buildings and schools shuttered and other disruptions rocked the nation, amid efforts to curb the transmission of the virus. On Monday, Cuomo, Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy collectively decided to shutter bars, restaurants, movie theaters and gyms in the tri-state area in an attempt to halt the growing number of cases in the region. They also said they would limit crowd capacity for recreational and social gatherings to 50 people. ""Our primary goal right now is to slow the spread of this virus so that the wave of new infections doesn't crash our health care system, and everyone agrees social distancing is the best way to do that,"" Cuomo said in a statement. ""This is not a war that can be won alone, which is why New York is partnering with our neighboring states to implement a uniform standard that not only keeps our people safe but also prevents 'state shopping' where residents of one state travel to another and vice versa.""

"                          President Trump announces the expansion of Medicare Telehealth Services and states HIPAA penalties will not be enforced Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday that the Trump administration wants to send checks to Americans “in the next two weeks” in an effort to help people cope with the economic cost of the coronavirus pandemic. “We’re looking at sending checks to Americans immediately,” Mnuchin said during a press briefing from the White House. “Americans need cash now, the president wants to get cash now. I mean now—in the next few weeks.” WHITE HOUSE EYES MASSIVE $850B STIMULUS PACKAGE NEXT, AS SENATE MOVES ON LATEST CORONAVIRUS BILL As the White House held its press conference Tuesday -- with President Trump, Vice President Pence, Mnuchin and the coronavirus task force present -- the Dow rallied 1,000 points, after sustaining historic losses on Monday. “The president has instructed me we have to this now,” Mnuchin added, though did not give specifics, except to say that the amount would be significant and that millionaires would not receive it. Mnuchin’s comments came as the White House is in negotiations with lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Congress to approve a sweeping economic stimulus package to help U.S. businesses and taxpayers deal with the economic fallout from the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus. CLICK FOR THE CORONAVIRUS GUIDELINES RELEASED BY THE WHITE HOUSE Mnuchin, on Tuesday, also announced that the Treasury Department would not extend the deadline to file taxes by the April 15 deadline, as much of the tax filing can be done online. “We encourage Americans who can file taxes to continue to file taxes on April 15 because for many Americans, you will get tax refunds and we don’t want you to lose out on those tax refunds,” Mnuchin said. Mnuchin added that if individuals or corporations owe money to the Internal Revenue Service after filing their taxes, those payments now are able to be deferred for up to 90 days interest-free. “If you owe a payment to the IRS, you can defer up to $1 million as an individual, and $10 million to corporations, interest-free and penalty-free for 90 days,” Mnuchin continued. “File your taxes, you’ll automatically not get charged interests or penalties.” Mnuchin is planning to outline a nearly $850 billion package during a lunch with Senate Republicans Tuesday, which Trump administration officials hope to have approved by the end of this week. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, opening the Senate on Tuesday morning, promised swift action. ""The Senate will not adjourn until we have passed significant and bold new steps above and beyond what the House has passed to help our strong nation and our strong underlying economy weather this storm,"" McConnell said. The Trump administration’s stimulus package is bigger than the 2008 bank bailout, and the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which was passed and signed under former President Barack Obama, and totaled $787 billion to help stabilize the economy about 14 months after the last recession began. Trump, during the press briefing Tuesday, said there was “great spirit” among lawmakers with regard to the plan. “I can say that for Republicans and Democrats.” Meanwhile, the president and the coronavirus task force, which is led by Vice President Pence, touted the administration’s progress on testing for COVID-19. Also on Tuesday, the president announced that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has announced new policies to increase testing. “We have tremendous testing capacity,” Trump said. Pence said that testing is now available in all 50 states, and announced that “state health authorities can now authorize labs in their state and expand existing testing capabilities.” Pence also said the administration has continued to expand its “public-private partnership” with “vast commercial labs around the country,” which he said is “increasing access to coronavirus testing.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “This is greatly expanding access, even as we speak,” Pence said Tuesday. “It is important that the American people understand that testing is happening all around the country,” Pence said, adding that experts “want me to tell the American people that you don’t need the testing to know what you should do.” “Experts say that if every American acts on the coronavirus guidelines, we can see a substantial reduction in the spread, but as the president said, it will take all of us to do it,” Pence said, noting those guidelines rolled out by the White House and CDC Monday which included social distancing, limiting social gatherings to groups of less than 10 individuals, and staying at home. “For the American people, as a whole, the risk of serious illness remains low,” Pence said. The president weighed in on the guidelines, adding that he “would recommend that people enjoy their living rooms,” and urged young people to do their part. One guideline, specifically, states that: “If you are an older person, stay home and away from other people.” Another states: “If you are a person with a serious underlying health condition that can put you at increased risk (for example, a condition that impairs your lungs or heart function or weakens your immune system), stay home and away from other people.” “We have to fight that invisible enemy, I guess unknown, but we’re getting to know it much better,” Trump said of the virus. “We are looking to save a maximum number of lives.” The president also announced that he has been having open conversations with governors across the nation, leaders in the fast-food, pharmaceutical and grocery industries; and will meet with leaders of the tourism industry on Tuesday. “We’re taking aggressive action now as one nation and one family so that America can rebound stronger frankly, stronger than ever,” he said. The World Health Organization designated COVID-19 a global pandemic last week. Trump announced a national emergency on Friday. The president also announced a temporary halt on air travel to the United States from Europe, now including flights from the United Kingdom, but excluding those carrying cargo. When asked Tuesday whether he would limit domestic travel, the president replied: “It’s possible.” The coronavirus task force also predicted Tuesday that the number of cases in the U.S. could peak in approximately 45-days. As of Tuesday morning, there were more than 4,660 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States, in 49 states, including Washington, D.C.

"                          With growing fears of the coronavirus pandemic, states have begun to respond by postponing their primary elections. Here are the states that have begun to take these initial steps. The spreading coronavirus outbreak has shut down more and more of American life — including schools, sporting events, bars, and now even elections. Multiple states have either announced they are postponing their presidential primary elections due to concerns about the novel coronavirus or made clear they are considering it. This comes after top election officials in Arizona, Florida, Ohio and Illinois issued a statement Friday saying they would go on with their Tuesday, March 17 elections, writing, ""Americans have participated in elections during challenging times in the past ... we are confident that voters in our states can safely and securely cast their ballots in this election."" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine backtracked Monday, announcing that his state health director will close down polls ""as a health emergency."" And Sunday night, in an interview after the CNN presidential debate that was held in a closed-off studio rather than in a hall with a live audience, presidential candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders hinted that it could be worth moving primary elections to protect against the coronavirus. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW TRAVELING DURING THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK: WHAT TO PACK ""I would hope that governors listen to the public health experts and what they are saying is … we don’t want gatherings of more than 50 people,” Sanders said. “I’m thinking about some of the elderly people sitting behind the desks, registering people and doing all that stuff. Does that make sense? I’m not sure it does."" Here are the states that are putting off their presidential primary elections: Louisiana Louisiana became the first state to postpone a primary or caucus on Friday, with Gov. John Bel Edwards signing an executive order to move the April 4 election to late June. ""Today I have certified that a state of emergency exists and requested that the governor issue an executive order postponing the elections this spring. We have requested postponing the April 4 primary election until June 20 and postponing the May 9 general election until July 25,"" Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin said. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES UNDER SIEGE AMID CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE: REPORT Christina Stephens, a spokeswoman for Edwards, said the move was to prevent further person-to-person transmission of the virus in Louisiana.

Ohio Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine asked a judge Monday to allow his state to postpone its election, originally scheduled for Tuesday, March 17, to June 2. ""We cannot conduct this election tomorrow,” he stressed in an announcement on Monday. After the judge ruled that the election would have to go forward, DeWine announced that he would prevent polls from opening anyway, with his state health director closing down polls ""as a health emergency."" DEMOCRACY 2020 DIGEST: OHIO TO ORDER POLLS CLOSED OVER CORONAVIRUS 'EMERGENCY,' GOVERNOR SAYS DeWine said that the state's in-person voting would not conform with CDC guidelines for preventing the spread of the coronavirus, and vowed to find a way to hold a ""free and fair"" election without putting voters' health at risk. ""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,"" DeWine said in a statement. ""As such, Health Director Dr. Amy Acton will order the polls closed as a health emergency. While the polls will be closed tomorrow, Secretary of State Frank LaRose will seek a remedy through the courts to extend voting options so that every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity."" The Ohio Supreme Court, in a ruling without an opinion Tuesday morning, denied a last-second effort to force the state to move ahead with the Tuesday elections, giving further legitimacy to DeWine's 11th-hour maneuver. Officials in the other three states slated to have elections Tuesday -- Arizona, Florida and Illinois -- confirmed Monday that they would still go through with their plans. Kentucky On recommendation from Kentucky Secretary of State Michael G. Adams, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear pushed back that state's primary from May 19 to June 23. ""I never would have imagined sitting here discussing this with you, but these are unprecedented times,"" Adams said in a video posted to Twitter. ""And we Kentuckians are having to change the way we do things on all fronts. Kentucky law allows the secretary of state and the governor to jointly act to change the time of an election due to a state of emergency."" He continued: ""Postponing the primary was not an easy decision, but the Republican secretary of state and Democratic governor agree, and so do county clerks of both parties, and they are our frontline election administrators. My hope is that this delay will allow us to have a normal election. Even if not, this delay will allow me, the state board of elections and our county clerks time to assess what changes we must make to ensure a successful primary election. There could be more changes, but this was a first step to buy is time and keep our citizens as safe as possible. We'll get through this."" Kentucky was originally slated to have one of the latest primaries of any state, with only five states and Washington, D.C., voting after it. This move by Kentucky throws into question almost the entire 2020 primary calendar, especially after President Trump's comments Monday that the coronavirus pandemic could last until July or August in the United States.

"                          President Trump announces the expansion of Medicare Telehealth Services and states HIPAA penalties will not be enforced Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday that the Trump administration wants to send checks to Americans “in the next two weeks” in an effort to help people cope with the economic fallout due to the coronavirus pandemic. “We’re looking at sending checks to Americans immediately,” Mnuchin said during a press briefing from the White House. “Americans need cash now, the president wants to get cash now. I mean now—in the next few weeks.” WHITE HOUSE EYES MASSIVE $850B STIMULUS PACKAGE NEXT, AS SENATE MOVES ON LATEST CORONAVIRUS BILL As the White House held its press conference Tuesday -- with President Trump, Vice President Pence, Mnuchin and the coronavirus task force present -- the Dow rallied nearly 1,000 points, after sustaining historic losses on Monday. “The president has instructed me we have to do this now,” Mnuchin added, though did not give specifics, except to say that the amount would be significant and that millionaires would not receive it. Fox News has learned, however, that Mnuchin is pressing GOP senators for a package that would send $200 billion-plus of payments to Americans by early April. Mnuchin’s comments came as the White House is in negotiations with lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Congress to approve a sweeping economic stimulus package to help U.S. businesses and taxpayers deal with the economic fallout from the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus. CLICK FOR THE CORONAVIRUS GUIDELINES RELEASED BY THE WHITE HOUSE Mnuchin, on Tuesday, also announced that the Treasury Department would not extend the deadline to file taxes by the April 15 deadline, as much of the tax filing can be done online. “We encourage Americans who can file taxes to continue to file taxes on April 15 because for many Americans, you will get tax refunds and we don’t want you to lose out on those tax refunds,” Mnuchin said. Mnuchin added that if individuals or corporations owe money to the Internal Revenue Service after filing their taxes, those payments now are able to be deferred for up to 90 days interest-free. “If you owe a payment to the IRS, you can defer up to $1 million as an individual, and $10 million to corporations, interest-free and penalty-free for 90 days,” Mnuchin continued. “File your taxes, you’ll automatically not get charged interests or penalties.” Mnuchin was planning to outline a nearly $850 billion package during a lunch with Senate Republicans Tuesday, which Trump administration officials hope to have approved by the end of this week. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, opening the Senate on Tuesday morning, promised swift action. ""The Senate will not adjourn until we have passed significant and bold new steps above and beyond what the House has passed to help our strong nation and our strong underlying economy weather this storm,"" McConnell said. The Trump administration’s stimulus package is bigger than the 2008 bank bailout, and the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which was passed and signed under former President Barack Obama, and totaled $787 billion to help stabilize the economy about 14 months after the last recession began. Trump, during the press briefing Tuesday, said there was “great spirit” among lawmakers with regard to the plan. “I can say that for Republicans and Democrats.” Meanwhile, the president and the coronavirus task force, which is led by Vice President Pence, touted the administration’s progress on testing for COVID-19, and announced that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has announced new policies to increase testing. “We have tremendous testing capacity,” Trump said. Pence said that testing is now available in all 50 states, and announced that “state health authorities can now authorize labs in their state and expand existing testing capabilities.” Pence also said the administration has continued to expand its “public-private partnership” with “vast commercial labs around the country,” which he said is “increasing access to coronavirus testing.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “This is greatly expanding access, even as we speak,” Pence said Tuesday. “It is important that the American people understand that testing is happening all around the country,” Pence said, adding that experts “want me to tell the American people that you don’t need the testing to know what you should do.” “Experts say that if every American acts on the coronavirus guidelines, we can see a substantial reduction in the spread, but as the president said, it will take all of us to do it,” Pence said, noting those guidelines rolled out by the White House and CDC Monday which included social distancing, limiting social gatherings to groups of less than 10 individuals, and staying at home. “For the American people, as a whole, the risk of serious illness remains low,” Pence said. The president weighed in on the guidelines, adding that he “would recommend that people enjoy their living rooms,” and urged young people to do their part. One guideline, specifically, states that: “If you are an older person, stay home and away from other people.” Another states: “If you are a person with a serious underlying health condition that can put you at increased risk (for example, a condition that impairs your lungs or heart function or weakens your immune system), stay home and away from other people.” “We have to fight that invisible enemy, I guess unknown, but we’re getting to know it much better,” Trump said of the virus. “We are looking to save a maximum number of lives.” The president also announced that he has been having open conversations with governors across the nation, leaders in the fast-food, pharmaceutical and grocery industries; and will meet with leaders of the tourism industry on Tuesday. The president was also asked about his tweets, referring to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese Virus,"" and whether he thought his rhetoric could create a stigma. Trump denied that notion, calling it a ""very accurate phrase,"" and said it was his response to China spreading disinformation about the U.S. military spreading COVID-19. ""Rather than having an argument, I said, I have to call it where it came from,"" Trump said. ""It did come from China."" The outbreak is believed to have originated at an animal and seafood market in the city of Wuhan, China. “We’re taking aggressive action now as one nation and one family so that America can rebound stronger frankly, stronger than ever,” he said. The World Health Organization designated COVID-19 a global pandemic last week. Trump announced a national emergency on Friday. The president also announced a temporary halt on air travel to the United States from Europe, now including flights from the United Kingdom, but excluding those carrying cargo. When asked Tuesday whether he would limit domestic travel, the president replied: “It’s possible.” The coronavirus task force also predicted Tuesday that the number of cases in the U.S. could peak in approximately 45-days. As of Tuesday morning, there were more than 4,660 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States, in 49 states, including Washington, D.C. The U.S., so far, has seen 85 coronavirus-related deaths.

"                          Mike Tobin reports from Chicago on why the state decided not to postpone voting. With the coronavirus outbreak spreading across the nation, Tuesday’s presidential primaries in Arizona, Florida and Illinois may well be the last ones held for the next couple months. Ohio’s primary was also scheduled to be held Tuesday – but state officials used emergency powers to postpone the contest hours before the polls were set to open. Primaries scheduled for next Tuesday in Georgia, April 4 in Louisiana, and May 19 in Kentucky already have been pushed back to later dates.  Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan also announced on Tuesday that his state's April 28 primary is being postponed until June 2. Democratic Party officials in Puerto Rico – which would hold its contest on March 29 – are seeking a delay as well.  PRIMARIES BEING HELD IN THREE BID STATES DESPITE CORONAVIRUS More delays are likely to follow for states scheduled to hold contests in the coming weeks. In Alaska, which is scheduled to hold its primary on April 4, the state Democratic Party urged voters to cast ballots by mail, tweeting: “If you were a registered Democrat by February 18, you should have your presidential primary ballot in the mail! Don't forget to follow the instructions, and mail it back postmarked by March 24!” These abrupt moves come with the country facing an unprecedented crisis as the coronavirus pandemic has caused millions of Americans to self-isolate in their homes in hopes of stemming the spread of the outbreak. After the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) urged against any gatherings of 50 people or more, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine stressed on Monday that “we cannot conduct this election tomorrow.” THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC Down the road – but also very much up in the air – are the biggest political gatherings of the year: the Democratic and Republican presidential nominating conventions. These two marquee political events are massive operations that take years of planning and have huge economic impacts on their host cities. But just like everything else in this world turned upside down by the virus that causes COVID-19, they may be in jeopardy. “The plan is to still move forward but this is obviously a fluid situation and we have to be prepared for everything,” a Democratic official with knowledge of planning for the Democratic National Convention told Fox News. “We’re going to stay in contact with relevant officials on the local, state, and federal level.” The convention is scheduled to be held July 13-16 in Milwaukee, Wis. Asked if there are conversations underway about pushing back the date of the convention or holding a more limited event, the official said: “We will have plans in place to do something differently if need be, but the plan right now is to move on as scheduled.” The GOP has a bit more breathing room. The Republican National Convention is scheduled to be held Aug. 24-27 in Charlotte, N.C. “As we move forward with planning, we remain in communication with local, state and federal officials and we will continue to closely monitor the situation and work with all stakeholders and health authorities to ensure every necessary precaution is taken into account,” 2020 Republican National Convention communications Blair Ellis told Fox News.  She said that “we prioritize the health and safety of delegates, media, guests, community members and staff.”       A polling location in Chicago, Illinois on primary day - March 17, 2020       But there’s a more immediate concern than the national conventions. Officials have already postponed some state party conventions, where the delegate process initiated during the primaries and caucuses continues and delegates who will represent their states at the national conventions are chosen. DNC Chairman Tom Perez sent state party chairs an email last week saying that the national party’s delegate selection team has been in contact with states that need to make changes to their delegate selection process due to the pandemic to ensure the nominating process will “continue without major interruptions.” Longtime Democratic National Committee member Kathy Sullivan – a veteran of the Rules Committee – noted that some states will need a waiver to change their approved delegate-selection plan. But she said “that’s not going to be a big deal. Everybody understands this is an unusual situation. … I think with the technology nowadays, these sorts of things can be handled.” A Democratic Party official acknowledged that “we are in uncharted waters right now” but emphasized, “what we have to do is stay in contact with everyone and be flexible, given the situation.” The potential freezing of the primary calendar comes as former Vice President Joe Biden – thanks to sweeping victories the past two-and-a-half weeks – has cemented his position as the unrivaled front-runner and has taken a commanding lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the all-important race for convention delegates. At the same time, Biden’s seen a tidal wave of support and endorsements from current and former members of Congress, governors and state lawmakers and party rainmakers – as centrists, moderates, and the party establishment have all coalesced around the former vice president in hopes that they’ve found the contender who can take out President Trump in November’s general election. Heading into Tuesday’s contests, Biden held a 153 pledged delegate lead over Sanders. And while he’s expected to pad that lead in Arizona, Florida, and Illinois – where public opinion polls indicated he held large leads over Sanders – the former vice president will still be far short of the 1,991 pledged delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination. That’s raised questions and concerns that Sanders – even if he suffers three more defeats on Tuesday – may stay in a contest that is being frozen in place by the global outbreak of the virus. On the eve of this week’s contests, Sanders in an email to supporters stressed that “this primary is far from over.”    ",         Coronavirus threatens to upend remaining primaries,         2020-03-17T130624-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/coronavirus-threatens-to-upend-remaining-primaries-even-conventions,Fox
"                          Federal prosecutors accuse the Republican lawmaker and his wife of illegally spending more than $250,000 in campaign money on family vacations, school tuition, dental work and other personal things; Jonathan Hunt reports from Los Angeles. Former Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., was sentenced on Tuesday to 11 months in prison and three years of supervised probation after pleading guilty to a single corruption charge.  The sentencing marks the end of a long saga for the disgraced Republican, who abruptly pleaded guilty to misusing campaign funds last December after arguing for more than a year that the criminal charges brought against him and his wife were a “witch hunt” aimed at driving the six-term Republican from office in the Democrat-controlled state.  Hunter officially resigned from his post in Congress in January after submitting letters of resignation to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and California Gov. Gavin Newsom. US REP. HUNTER BLAMES 'DEMOCRAT PROSECUTORS' FOR HIS INDICTMENT ON CORRUPTION CHARGES Hunter’s wife, Margaret Hunter, also was charged in the case and in June accepted a plea deal that called for her to testify against her husband. The couple could have faced decades in prison before the plea deals. Federal prosecutors said the couple spent more than $250,000 in campaign money for golf outings, family vacations to Italy and Hawaii, tequila shots and airline tickets for their pet rabbit. Prosecutors also revealed Hunter spent some of the money on romantic relationships with lobbyists and congressional aides. Hunter originally resisted calls to resign, framing the charges as a political attack by prosecutors sympathetic to Democrat Hillary Clinton. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP After his wife agreed to a plea deal, Hunter said: “It’s obvious that the Department of Justice went after her to get to me for political reasons.” Hunter’s resignation sets up the prospect of a second special House election in California this year. Freshman Rep. Katie Hill, a rising Democratic star, resigned her Los Angeles-area seat in October after explicit photos of her were posted online. Hunter narrowly survived a challenge in 2018 from Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar, a political newcomer. The 30-year-old Campa-Najjar is running again and Republican contenders include former Rep. Darrell Issa and radio personality Carl DeMaio, a former San Diego city councilman. The Associated Press contributed to this report.     ",         Former GOP Rep.

Bernie] Sanders' last stand. … There are 67 pledged delegates at stake in Arizona's Democratic presidential primary. The results in Arizona will be an important indicator, as Sanders has typically fared better in western states… Florida is the biggest prize available on March 17, awarding 219 pledged delegates in all. A diverse swing state, a good performance in Florida will help Sanders or [Joe] Biden make the case that they are the most electable Democrat to face President Trump in November. …Illinois will dole out 155 pledged delegates on March 17. Sanders laid some groundwork in Illinois earlier in the primary, visiting the state for three days to Biden's one as of March 11. Ohio originally was scheduled to have its primaries on March 17 before Gov. Mike DeWine announced a lawsuit Monday to push back the date to June 2.”Ohio Gov. DeWine wins fight to postpone primary - Politico: “Polls will not open for Ohio's primary election Tuesday after a late-night decision from Gov. Mike DeWine's administration, effectively upheld by the state Supreme Court, to delay in-person voting until June in an effort to protect voters and poll workers from the coronavirus outbreak. … The election was in limbo for several hours Monday night after a judge in Columbus denied a last-minute attempt backed by the state to postpone the primary election. But DeWine responded with an order from the state's top health official, Amy Acton, closing physical polling places as the legal battle moved up to the Ohio Supreme Court. Early Tuesday morning, four judges on that court issued a unanimous, unsigned ruling declining to stop the state from shuttering polls. Three other judges on the court recused — two because they're currently running for reelection and the other because he is DeWine's son. The ruling effectively overturns the Monday ruling from Franklin County Judge Richard Frye that the primary had to continue as scheduled.”Maryland joins growing list of states postponing primaries - Politico: “Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced that he was postponing the state's primaries, originally scheduled for late April, to June 2 as the country grapples with the spread of the coronavirus. Maryland is now the fifth state to move its primaries, joining Louisiana, Georgia, Kentucky and Ohio, which saw its primary originally scheduled for today pushed until June after an eleventh-hour legal battle. … But Maryland will still hold one election on April 28, foreshadowing a potentially broad move toward mail voting that could pave the way for elections across the country to continue during the coronavirus crisis. Hogan said he believed the special election to fill the seat of the late Rep. Elijah Cummings, in Maryland's Baltimore-based 7th Congressional District, should forward on as a mail-in only election, the first federal election to be shifted to mail voting in response to coronavirus.”BEREXITPolitico: “Bernie Sanders’ path to the Democratic nomination is closing, but a quick exit is far from guaranteed — even if he gets wiped out Tuesday. From his debate posture to staffing moves to the ‘virtual rally’ he convened Monday evening, the Vermont senator is signaling that he may not be ready to concede. If Sanders remains in the race, it will be in part to keep his ‘political revolution’ alive. According to people familiar with his thinking, Sanders will not only consider what’s best for his campaign, but also the progressive movement. Many of Sanders’ aides and allies also expect him to press onward after Tuesday. They see a benefit in amassing as many delegates as possible in order to influence the party platform at the Democratic National Convention this summer — even if Sanders himself can’t win the nomination. … Notably, Sanders has staff in place for states that vote as late as April 28, according to a campaign adviser, including New York. Sanders’ aides have long thought that he would have a good shot in the Empire State, which is rich in delegates.”Biden’s female veep promise reignites female president hopes - WaPo: “Biden, 77, has described himself as a ‘bridge’ to the next generation of leaders, a comment widely interpreted as a signal that he’d serve just one term, meaning his running mate would be even more of a president-in-waiting than usual. … A person close to the Biden team who was not authorized to speak publicly, and so spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the campaign will soon announce a running mate vetting operation, but warned that the campaign is in the midst of growing quickly after its rocky start. Biden has told MSNBC that it’s ‘very important’ to pick someone who’s been tested via a presidential campaign, suggesting that the women who ran against him may have an edge. Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) have both endorsed Biden, and Klobuchar in particular has gone out of her way to show her loyalty.”THE RULEBOOK: AVIOD THE ABYSS“This is the melancholy situation to which we have been brought by those very maxims and councils which would now deter us from adopting the proposed Constitution; and which, not content with having conducted us to the brink of a precipice, seem resolved to plunge us into the abyss that awaits us below.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 15TIME OUT: CÓISIR COSÚIL LEIS NA GAEILInsider: “It wasn't until the 1970s that pubs in Ireland opened on St. Patrick's Day, and in the 1990s, Dublin started hosting what's now Ireland's largest St. Patrick's Day festival… Leading up to the holiday, shamrocks can be found blooming at street markets across the country. … It's customary to wear a real shamrock leaf pinned to a shirt. … A pint of Guinness is perhaps an obvious St. Patrick's tradition, but bacon and cabbage is another traditional Irish meal. … Some locals or visitors may skip the crowds of the parade and head to St. Patrick's Island, one of the Skerries Islands off the coast of Dublin.

Fox News has learned that the White House specifically is pushing an $850 billion stimulus, largely in the form of tax relief measures. Roughly $500 billion of this would be tied to a payroll tax cut, while $250 billion would come in the form of Small Business Administration loans and another $58 billion would be directed to the airline industry, among other measures. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will attend the Senate GOP's weekly policy lunch Tuesday -- which will take place in a larger room that it usually does so the senators can practice social distancing -- to discuss the details of the comprehensive coronavirus proposal from the White House.”House stands pat, puts pressure on Senate - Roll Call: “The House is indefinitely extending its current district work period, with Democratic leaders telling their members Monday that they may not call them back to Washington until a third legislative package responding to the coronavirus pandemic is ready for a vote. House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer and Speaker Nancy Pelosi provided the schedule update on a Monday afternoon conference call with the Democratic Caucus, according to a source on the call who was not authorized to speak publicly. While Hoyer mentioned waiting until a third bill is ready, the Maryland Democrat did not rule out calling the House back sooner for other reasons, a Hoyer aide said.”Fed shares emergency lending program - NYT: “The Federal Reserve on Tuesday took another step to try and prop up the American economy, saying it would begin buying up a type of short-term debt companies use for funding, known as commercial paper, to help keep credit flowing to households and businesses. The program, enacted using the Fed’s emergency lending powers, pulls a page from the central bank’s 2008 financial crisis playbook and is an attempt to keep the economy and financial system functioning by backstopping a market that some of America’s biggest companies use to raise cash. Banks and companies have been issuing commercial paper to shore up their coffers as coronavirus leads to quarantines, shutters shopping centers and closes restaurants. But hardly anybody has been buying the debt. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, whose department will provide $10 billion of credit protection to the Fed using the Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund, said the facility would allow the central bank to buy up to $1 trillion worth of commercial paper ‘as needed.’”Poll finds Americans have little trust in coronavirus info from Trump - NPR: “Americans have little trust in the information they are hearing from President Trump about the novel coronavirus, and their confidence in the federal government's response to it is declining sharply, according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. Just 46% of Americans now say the federal government is doing enough to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, down from 61% in February. Just 37% of Americans now say they had a good amount or a great deal of trust in what they're hearing from the president, while 60% say they had not very much or no trust at all in what he's saying. The president rates worst of all groups tested, be it public health officials, state and local leaders or the news media. And more Americans disapprove of the president's handling of the pandemic than approve by a 49%-44% margin. But that does not differ greatly from his overall job approval rating, which stands at 43%.”Drucker: Republicans are less concerned about coronavirus than Dems - WashEx: “Republican voters are less concerned about the coronavirus pandemic, offering President Trump some measure of political cover as the November elections approach amid an accelerating public health crisis that is pushing the economy toward recession. Approximately 40% of self-identified Republicans fear that an acquaintance or family member might contract COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, compared to a whopping two-thirds of Democratic voters, according to public opinion polls conducted this month. This lopsided partisan split, which holds across several issues related to the pandemic, could help Trump weather the political fallout as nearly every aspect of American society grind to a screeching halt.”PLAY-BY-PLAYFormer Rep.

"                          The coronavirus is causing major adjustments to the Democratic presidential contest as debates have been cancelled and former Vice President Joe Biden attacks President Trump over his handling of the COVID-19 situation; Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy reports. Joe Biden is 77 years old. President Trump is 73 years old. Bernie Sanders is 78 years old and had a heart attack last year. They are just the kind of Americans that the CDC would consider most at risk amid the coronavirus outbreak. They're also running for president -- or in the case of Trump, re-election. TRUMP WANTS TO SEND AMERICANS CHECKS 'IMMEDIATELY' IN RESPONSE TO CORONAVIRUS, MNUCHIN SAYS So as the pandemic has forced the entire country to change its daily habits, so too has it compelled 2020's septuagenarian presidential field to take precautions. In the Democratic primary race, Biden and Sanders have transitioned essentially to a virtual campaign, for the good of their supporters, their staff and themselves. Florida, Illinois and Arizona are holding primaries Tuesday, but the rest of the primary calendar remains in limbo as other states postpone. In the meantime, the rapidly spreading coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, has grounded both the former vice president and Vermont senator, leading them to cancel campaign events and shift to relying on virtual rallies and town halls and press briefings from home. The two candidates -- and especially Trump -- are still probably doing more than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the White House would recommend. The administration on Monday released new guidelines for Americans to curb the spread of COVID-19; one guideline specifically states: “If you are an older person, stay home and away from other people.” Another states: “If you are a person with a serious underlying health condition that can put you at increased risk (for example, a condition that impairs your lungs or heart function or weakens your immune system), stay home and away from other people.” During Sunday’s primary debate, Sanders was asked about his heart attack in October, and how he planned to stay safe during the outbreak. “We had a fireside chat, not a rally,” Sanders said during the debate. “I love doing rallies and we bring many thousands of people out to our rallies. I enjoy it very much. We’re not doing that right now.” Sanders also said that he did not shake hands with the former vice president at the beginning of the debate and that he is “very careful about the people I am interacting with.” Biden, in a veiled swipe at Sanders, said later, “fortunately, I don’t have any of the underlying conditions you’re talking about,” adding that he is in “good health.” Trump, who tested negative for coronavirus over the weekend, has still been holding in-person meetings with the coronavirus task force, executives from pharmaceutical and health care industries, and more. The president held a briefing with reporters in the James S. Brady press briefing room at the White House Tuesday and said he was slated to meet with leaders of the tourism industry later in the day. Meanwhile, the Biden campaign said the former vice president would spend Tuesday’s primary day in Delaware. It is unclear, at this point, if he will hold any public events. Biden conducted a tele-town hall on Monday into Illinois, Arizona and Florida. The Sanders campaign said Tuesday they are “not doing traditional GOTV outreach in states holding primary contests today. “We are making clear to voters that we believe going to the polls amid the coronavirus outbreak is a personal decision and we respect whichever choice they make,” Mike Casca, Bernie 2020 communications director, said in a statement. “We are also passing along guidance from the CDC on staying safe during the crisis.” SANDERS ATTACKS BIDEN RECORD AS ONE-ON-ONE DEBATE TURNS PERSONAL Sanders also previously had suggested that the primaries on Tuesday should be postponed for safety reasons amid the coronavirus outbreak. In a post-debate interview on CNN, Sanders, I-Vt., pointed to the guidelines released by the CDC limiting gatherings for the next eight weeks as the country grapples with the highly contagious COVID-19. “I would hope that governors listen to the public health experts and what they are saying is…we don’t want gatherings of more than 50 people,” Sanders said when asked about Tuesday’s contests. “I’m thinking about some of the elderly people sitting behind the desks, registering people and doing all that stuff. Does that make sense? I’m not sure it does.” Ohio later postponed its Tuesday primary, but the other states pressed ahead. As of Tuesday afternoon, there were more than 5,600 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in the United States, with 94 coronavirus-related deaths.

"                          Reaction from Peter Morici, business professor at the University of Maryland and former chief economist for the U.S. International Trade Commission. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that the coronavirus pandemic is ""worse than 9/11"" for the airline industry as he discussed the Trump administration's economic relief plans at a White House coronavirus briefing Tuesday. ""I think, as you know, this is worse than 9/11. For the airline industry, this is, they are almost ground to a halt,"" Mnuchin said to reporters. Mnuchin, after the briefing, was slated to head over to Capitol Hill to pitch the Trump administration's $850 billion stimulus package to Republican senators at their weekly policy lunch. That package includes $58 billion for the airline industry, along with a roughly $500 billion payroll tax cut and $250 billion in Small Business Administration loans. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW WHITE HOUSE EYES MASSIVE $850B STIMULUS PACKAGE NEXT, AS SENATE MOVES ON LATEST CORONAVIRUS BILL ""The airline industry will be in good shape,"" Trump added as reporters pushed Mnuchin on specifics in the administration's proposal. Discussing the Trump administration's stimulus package more broadly, Mnuchin said that he planned to shepherd the president's plan along in Congress much as he served as the point person negotiating a smaller coronavirus package with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that passed the House of Representatives early Saturday morning. ""We look forward to having bipartisan support -- we're now working with the Senate -- to pass this legislation very quickly. And these will be payments to small businesses,"" Mnuchin said. ""We've talked about loan guarantees to critical industries such as airlines and hotels, and we've also talked about a stimulus package to the American worker. You can think of this as something like business interruption payments for the American workers."" Mnuchin also discussed other measures the Trump administration is taking to reduce the economic sting out of the quasi-shutdown of the American economy as local, state and federal governments work to contain the spread of the virus that was declared a pandemic last week by the World Health Organization. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The treasury secretary said Trump favors a payroll tax holiday but that the administration is looking at sending checks to Americans  ""immediately"" to help cover coronavirus-related expenses. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, have each made similar proposals in Congress in recent days. Mnuchin, in an interview with Chris Wallace on ""Fox News Sunday,"" pitched ""a big stimulus program because we need to help American workers now."" But he made clear that he and the president are not asking for a bailout. ""If you're providing liquidity to good businesses that just need liquidity for 3 to 6 months,"" he said, ""that's not a bailout.""

"                          Fox News Decision Desk projects that former Vice President Joe Biden will decisively beat Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders in the delegate-rich states of Florida and Illinois. Joe Biden swept another round of delegate-rich contests Tuesday – winning in Florida, Illinois and Arizona – further cementing the former vice president as the dominant front-runner in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination over Bernie Sanders as the coronavirus threat scrambles the primary calendar for the foreseeable future. Florida and Illinois will award a hefty 219 and 155 pledged delegates, respectively, while Arizona is worth 67 delegates. Together, the contests are likely to only add to the pressure on Sanders to reconsider his presence in the race. CLICK FOR LIVE RESULTS Last week, Sanders vowed to press on after a string of defeats, signaling he wants to continue to pressure Biden to embrace more progressive policies.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke)       ""Our campaign has had a very good night,"" Biden told supporters in Wilmington, Delaware, before the Arizona race was called. ""We've moved closer to securing the Democratic Party's nomination for president. And we're doing it by building a broad coalition that we need to win in November, with strong support from the African-American community, the Latino community, high school-aged people, educated people ... labor, teachers, suburban women, veterans, firefighters and so many more."" Once again, he extended an olive branch to Sanders in a nudge to convince him to step aside, though as recently as their debate on Sunday, Sanders showed little inclination to accept. ""Senator Sanders and I may disagree on tactics, but we share a common vision for the need to provide affordable health care for all Americans, reducing income inequality hat has risen so drastically, to tackling the existential threat of our time, climate change,"" he said. ""Senator Sanders and his supporters have brought a remarkable passion and tenacity to all of these issues. ... Together, they have shifted the fundamental conversation in this country. So let me say, especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Senator Sanders. I hear you."" SANDERS REVEALS HOW HE'LL PAY FOR PROGRAMS -- ARE THERE ISSUES? Earlier in the evening, Sanders gave an online address as well focused on the pandemic, providing a detailed list of proposals to address the medical and economic issues caused by the novel coronavirus. Sanders said his proposals would cost ""at least $2 trillion"" and would include monthly $2,000 checks to American households.

(AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast)       In Florida, a key swing state in the general election, Sanders was walloped. Biden was ahead in the state by a massive margin of 61.5 percent to 22.7 percent, with 82 percent of precincts reporting. The rout was somewhat expected, with the state's sizable Cuban- and Venezuelan-American population largely resistant to Sanders' democratic socialist politics and many voters angered after he defended former Cuban dictator Fidel Castro's literacy programs. Twenty percent of Democratic primary voters in the Florida primary were Hispanic -– a group that typically has been a strength for Sanders. Six-in-ten voted for Biden, who received approximately two-thirds of the vote among Puerto Ricans and almost six-in-ten among Cubans, according to the Fox News Voter Analysis. FOX NEWS VOTER ANALYSIS: FULL METHODOLOGY Despite ongoing concerns about the coronavirus, seniors made up more than one-third of the electorate in Florida – the highest portion in any primary surveyed this year, the Fox News Voter Analysis showed. Biden easily won voters over the age of 65, with almost eight-in-ten supporting him. Electability continued to play a factor in Biden's favor.

Huh)       Across all states voting on Tuesday, voters said they believed Biden was better positioned to win in November. Roughly 83 percent of voters in Arizona, Florida, and Illinois felt Biden could beat President Trump, while only about 62 percent of voters in those states had the same confidence in Sanders, according to Fox News Voter Analysis. Meanwhile, Trump easily clinched the Republican presidential nomination with wins in the Illinois and Florida Republican primaries, officially dashing the hopes of any of the extreme long-shot candidates who challenged him in that primary. A total of 441 delegates was at stake in the Democratic primary on Tuesday, and the big question was whether the coronavirus would affect turnout at the polls. Some early indications were that turnout in Florida actually may have been higher than 2016 figures. DNC CHAIR URGES VOTERS TO CAST BALLOTS BY MAIL Biden is moving closer to securing the Democratic presidential nomination but had faced the possibility of a setback if the older voters who tend to support him didn't show up. Sanders, meanwhile, couldn't afford to lose support from young voters who have been his most loyal supporters. In the end, Biden did not appear to suffer any measurable loss of support. Problems related to the virus scare still reportedly popped up across the country, including in Florida, the biggest delegate prize of the evening. In Okaloosa County on the Panhandle, two dozen poll workers dropped out, leaving supervisors scrambling to find replacements. Millions of voters have already participated in some form of early voting. But there were some signs on Tuesday that voters — and poll workers — were staying home.

Only 17 people had voted, a pace that officials said was unusually slow. In Palm Beach County, Florida, 800 volunteer poll workers backed out on Monday and just 100 new volunteers offered to take their place. In Illinois, there was a push to relocate about 50 Chicago-area polling places after locations canceled at the last minute and said they would not be available for use on Tuesday.

Leaders in Ohio called off their primary just hours before polls were set to open as the federal government urged Americans not to gather in groups of 10 or more and asked older people to stay home. The state's Democratic Party said it was weighing options for challenging that move, which was pushed by the Republican governor. Georgia has delayed its primary from March 24 to May 19, and Louisiana from April 4 to June 20. Additionally, Maryland has moved its April 28 primary to June 2, and Kentucky has pushed its primary from May 19 to June 23. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) has reportedly warned that states that delay their primaries past June 9 could face a hefty delegate penalty -- angering some commentators who call the ultimatum reckless given the threat posed by coronavirus. “The right to vote is the foundation of our democracy, and we must do everything we can to protect and expand that right instead of bringing our democratic process to a halt,” DNC chairman Tom Perez said in a statement. He is urging states to expand options like voting by mail in upcoming contests.

The coronavirus outbreak and its impact on the primary calendar could only amplify calls for Sanders to drop out of the race. About half of the delegates in the Democratic primary have already been awarded and, with Biden looking at another big night Tuesday, he will pad an already large and perhaps insurmountable lead. CORONAVIRUS THREATENS TO UPEND REMAINING PRIMARIES, CONVENTIONS Biden's quest for his party's nomination now seems within reach.

""Even though a decision has not yet been made by the city or by the state, I think New Yorkers should be prepared right now for the possibility of a shelter-in-place order,"" de Blasio, a Democrat, said in a press conference Friday.

Daniel Lipinski, D-Ill., a rare anti-abortion House Democrat, has lost his party’s primary race to challenger Marie Newman, a small business owner endorsed by far-left Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. Newman challenged Lipinski in 2018 and was edged out in a close primary race, but this time she managed to narrowly defeat the incumbent congressman, who has represented Illinois’ third district since 2005. JUSSIE SMOLLETT PROSECUTOR WINS PRIMARY “This is a Democratic district. Let’s have a Real Democrat fighting for us,” Newman tweeted Monday, including infographics showing how Lipinski’s past votes against Obamacare and for restricting access to women’s reproductive healthcare are at odds with her own support for universal healthcare and greater access to abortions. The win all but assures that Newman, 55, will take over the seat that Lipinski’s father held for nearly three decades before he retired after the 2004 primary and local Democrats chose his son to replace him on the general election ballot. Newman, a former management consultant who started and led an anti-bullying nonprofit, argued Lipinski no longer reflected the views of the district, which backed Sen. Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist, over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential primary. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., endorsed Newman back in September. She told the New York Times that Newman is ""a textbook example of one of the ways that we could be better as a party — to come from a deep blue seat and to be championing all the issues we need to be championing.""

"                          Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Cook County, Illinois State’s Attorney Kim Foxx prevailed in Tuesday’s Democratic primary, where she faced several challengers who had focused on the controversy surrounding her handling of the Jussie Smollett case. Foxx drew national attention over Smollett's case, which began with a hate crime investigation, turned into charges against Smollett for an alleged hoax, and ended with Foxx dismissing the case altogether, drawing the ire of local police. JUSSIE SMOLLETT'S BID TO GET CHARGES THROWN OUT REJECTED BY ILLINOIS SUPREME COURT “This win is about all of us. I’ve spent the last four years working to reform a system that is not representative of the communities it serves - I’m ready to continue this work,” Foxx said. The three Democrats who challenged Foxx made her handling of the Jussie Smollett case -- which is now before a special prosecutor-- central to the campaign. Foxx abruptly dropped charges last year against the “Empire” actor, who was accused of staging a racist, anti-gay attack. Questions loom about whether she acted improperly for speaking to a Smollett relative and aide to former first lady Michelle Obama before the charges were dismissed. Foxx had said that she had recused herself from the case due to those contacts, but her office continued to handle it instead of turning it over to a special prosecutor. A spokesperson later explained that Foxx only meant that she was recusing herself in the “colloquial” sense, and that she herself would not be involved. Text messages later revealed that Foxx still gave her opinion on the matter to a deputy – saying Smollett was overcharged -- in the weeks before Smollett’s charges were dropped. A special prosecutor reinstated the charges, which Foxx called political. Foxx fended off challenges from Bill Conway, Donna More, and Bob Fioretti, with Conway placing a distant second despite his family pouring millions into his campaign.

"                          The choices we make as individuals will collectively make a big difference to the pandemic, says Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Joe Biden solidified his hold on the Democratic nomination, adding to his delegate lead with big wins in Florida, Illinois and Arizona.  JOE BIDEN CRUISES TO A  TUESDAY SWEEP The primary – like so much else in American life – was deeply affected by the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. The campaigns stopped holding events, the debate between Biden and Sanders was moved from Arizona to Washington, D.C., and Ohio canceled its election less than 24 hours before polls opened.  Fox News Voter Analysis surveys in each state highlighted the extent to which the pandemic was on Democratic primary voters’ minds as they headed to the polls: at least three-quarters of voters in each state were at least somewhat concerned they or someone in their family might contract the virus. Concern about the virus was particularly pronounced among seniors in each state.  HERE'S HOW TO STOP THE CORONAVIRUS SPREAD Democratic primary voters have said health care is the top issue facing the country in each contest surveyed to date, and that trend continued Tuesday. Nearly half cited health care as the top issue in Arizona and Florida, rivaling the record high set last week in Missouri (47 percent). In the primaries through Super Tuesday, the number of voters prioritizing health care tended to be in the mid-thirties.  Despite the recent reversal in the stock market, fewer than two-in-ten voters in each state called the economy the top issue, placing it just ahead of climate change in Florida and Illinois and in third place (behind climate change) in Arizona. In each state, it was far below health care on voters’ list of priorities.  At least seven-in-ten voters in each state favored changing to a single-payer health care system, a policy Sanders has championed, but even these voters backed Biden by double-digit margins in Florida (+32 percentage points) and Illinois (+16 points). Sanders won them – but only narrowly – in Arizona (+5 points).  Roughly nine-in-ten voters in each state favored moving to a public option health care system. PRIMARY TRENDS While concern about coronavirus has upended much of the primary in the past several days, the main trends and themes of the race stayed constant.  Democratic primary voters remained split between preferring a candidate who would restore the political system to the way it worked before Trump and a candidate who promised fundamental change. Biden won six-in-ten “restore” voters in Arizona and roughly eight-in-ten in Florida and Illinois. Sanders won “change” voters by a wide margin in Arizona, by a narrower spread in Illinois, and lost them in Florida.  Moreover, Biden continued to rely on strong support among older voters, African Americans, and political moderates. He also won suburban and rural voters in each state.  In the run-up to this week’s contests, Biden embraced Elizabeth Warren’s bankruptcy protection plan and endorsed free public college tuition for most families. Both moves were seen as attempts to appeal to younger voters. He won more than one-third of 18 to 29-year-olds in Florida and more than one-quarter in Illinois – better marks than he achieved in previous contests (except for those in southern states with large African American populations).  Latino voters were another key focus for Biden’s campaign. He won this group handily in Florida and received more than one-third of the Hispanic vote in Arizona and Illinois. His previous high-water mark among Latinos was 36 percent in Virginia.  While Biden was able to somewhat expand his coalition, support for Sanders continued to run almost exclusively with the groups who have supported him all along: voters under age 30, Latinos, and self-described “very liberal” voters. His lack of support among seniors (14 percent or less in each state) and black voters (18 percent in Florida and 23 percent in Illinois) proved too much of a liability to overcome.  Biden’s broader coalition meant that more voters would be satisfied if he were the eventual Democratic nominee: between 76 percent (Arizona) and 84 percent (Florida) would be satisfied with Biden; between 63 percent (Florida) and 68 percent (Arizona and Illinois) would be satisfied with Sanders.  Roughly nine-in-ten Democratic primary voters in each state said they would definitely or probably support Biden if he were the nominee. Sanders enjoyed similar support in Arizona (90 percent), but trailed Biden’s mark slightly in Illinois and Florida.  Biden and Sanders voters were equally likely to say they would back the other candidate if he won the nomination. This marks a change from earlier in the primary process when Sanders supporters were somewhat less likely to say they would support the eventual nominee.  Overall, more Democrats in each state felt Biden had a better chance against Trump in the fall.  Roughly eight-in-ten voters in each state were confident that the leadership of the Democratic Party represented their values – though Sanders supporters were more likely to express some skepticism on that front.  Similarly, about seven-in-ten voters in each state had confidence that the nomination process was fair – but roughly half of Sanders backers felt the process was unfair. FLORIDA Florida had the most delegates up for grabs on Tuesday, and Biden won the state convincingly. Seniors made up more than one-third of the electorate, which provided him a major boost. Latinos were also a source of strength for Biden in Florida, an important change for him after he struggled to win their votes in other states. Hispanics under age 45 split between Biden (43 percent) and Sanders (44 percent), while the former vice president won by 57 points among Latinos over 45 – giving Biden a comfortable win with this group overall. Some of Sanders’ trouble in Florida may have been related to his praise for the accomplishments of Fidel Castro’s regime in Cuba. However, he did somewhat better with Cuban voters (losing 36-57 percent) than among Puerto Ricans (23-66 percent). Sanders also lost Hispanics from places besides Cuba and Puerto Rico (34-54 percent).  In a sign of Biden’s dominance, he and Sanders split the “very liberal” vote. Biden previously only won very liberal voters in Mississippi; beyond that, they were a core part of Sanders’ base. Despite being Jewish himself, Sanders was unable to earn significant support from Florida’s sizable Jewish population.  Florida will likely be a swing state in the November election. Democratic primary voters there thought Biden gave them the best chance against Trump. Twice as many thought Biden could definitely beat Trump (55 percent) than thought Sanders could (24 percent). ARIZONA Arizona was Sanders’ best state, thanks in large part to the fact that many ballots were cast before the race shifted dramatically in the run-up to Super Tuesday. Sanders won handily among long-time supporters (57-32 percent), while those who made up their minds in the last month broke heavily for Biden. Sanders won the Latino vote by an 8-point margin but was unable to win an outright majority among this key group. While Hispanic voters are a key source of strength for the Vermont senator, he has won less than 50 percent of the Latino vote in every state except California (exactly 50 percent).  Despite sharing a border with Mexico and the ongoing debate about President Trump’s proposed border wall, just 6 percent of Arizona Democratic primary voters cited immigration as the top issue facing the country. On immigration policy, almost twice as many opposed increasing security along the U.S.-Mexico border as favored it.  Hispanic primary voters opposed increasing border security by a narrower margin than (44 percent favor vs. 56 percent oppose) white voters (33 percent favor vs. 67 percent oppose).  When it comes to the general election, Arizona Democratic primary voters were more confident in Biden’s chances against Trump than Sanders’.  More results can be found here ILLINOIS   Despite the fact that a record-high 68 percent of Illinois Democratic primary voters would be satisfied if Sanders were the nominee, Biden won the state by a massive margin. The former vice president ran up huge numbers among voters over age 45, moderates, and African Americans – and was particularly dominant among women over age 65.  Religious voters of every major denomination went for Biden, and he won the Jewish vote by a 41-point margin. Non-religious voters split much more evenly. Even in the Land of Lincoln, Democratic primary voters split over paying reparations for slavery. Black voters overwhelmingly favored the idea, while six-in-ten white voters opposed it.

Surveys for the March 17 primary states were conducted in Arizona, Florida, and Illinois. The surveys were conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago the week before the primaries, concluding as polls closed. Interviews were conducted in English or Spanish. The surveys are based on interviews with a random sample of registered voters drawn from the state voter file. In Florida and Illinois, these probability sample results were supplemented by interviews with self-identified registered voters recruited from nonprobability online panels.  The sample sizes and margins of sampling error were 1,977 in Arizona (plus or minus 3.4 percentage points), 3,385 in Florida (plus or minus 3.0 percentage points), and 2,715 in Illinois (plus or minus 3.2 percentage points).

Though Majority Leader Mitch McConnell directed the Republican majority to pass the House coronavirus package despite its flaws, the Senate could not come to an agreement and will take up the bills on Wednesday, along with an amendment from Sen. Rand Paul, R.-Ky. The bill needed 60 votes to pass the upper chamber, and McConnell originally said the Senate would not take a recess until the bill was passed. ""We're going to move here in warp speed for the Senate, which almost never does anything quickly,"" McConnell said Tuesday. ""A number of my members think there were considerable shortcomings in the House bill. My counsel to them it is to gag and vote for it anyway,"" McConnell said Tuesday after lunching with his fellow Republicans. A senior GOP source told Fox News over the weekend not to “underestimate the challenge the Senate could face passing this bill.” Some GOP lawmakers worried that the paid leave portion of the bill would hurt small businesses. The House bill would cap paid leave at companies with 500 employees, and businesses with fewer than 50 employees could apply for a waiver. SANDERS CALLS FOR $2G A MONTH TO HOUSEHOLDS  The Senate remained in session all day with the measures without agreement after Paul objected to the measures. Now the Senate will try to approve the coronavirus packages sometime Wednesday, and to vote on the amendment by Paul. The House bill, which has the support of President Trump, would make coronavirus testing free, expand unemployment aid to states, offer 14 paid sick days and extend emergency leave for workers dealing with the coronavirus.

Former Vice President Joe Biden called for unity among Democrats and Americans in general Tuesday night, as the country grapples with the coronavirus pandemic -- and as he claimed big wins in the latest Democratic primaries. Biden addressed an online audience from his home in Wilmington, Del., noting the significance of strong leadership as well as action from individuals such as social distancing. SANDERS CALLS FOR $2G A MONTH FOR HOUSEHOLDS, ADMITS CORONAVIRUS PLAN WOULD COST AT LEAST $2 TRILLION “Yes, this is a moment where we need our leaders to lead,"" Biden said, ""but it's also a moment where the choices and decisions we make as individuals are going to collectively impact on what happens, make a big difference in the severity of this outbreak, and the ability of our medical and hospital systems to handle it."" The Democratic presidential hopeful expressed optimism in the American public's ability to overcome. ""That's who we are. Ordinary people doing extraordinary things when the need arises,"" he said. Biden then addressed Tuesday's primaries, where he decisively won in Florida and Illinois, with results from Arizona's primary still incoming as he spoke. A fourth scheduled primary, in Ohio, was abruptly postponed as a coronavirus-related precaution. As he has done in the past, Biden touted his ability to form coalitions, mentioning support he has received from black and Latino voters, as well as suburban women, laborers and teachers. Biden then addressed the portion of the Democratic electorate that he still needs to win over: Sen. Bernie Sanders' supporters. He appealed to them by claiming that while he and Sanders differ in their ""tactics,"" they ""share a common vision"" that includes affordable health care, decreasing income inequality, and climate change, which Biden referred to as ""the existential threat of our time."" The moderate Biden praised the ""remarkable passion and tenacity "" of Sanders and his supporters, and recognized that ""they have shifted the fundamental conversation in this country."" Specifically addressing younger voters who are inspired by Sanders, Biden had a clear message: ""I hear you, I know what’s at stake. I know what we have to do."" Biden concluded by stating that his goal is to unify the Democratic Party and the country as a whole, using the coronavirus outbreak as an example for what kind of unity is needed. ""It’s moments like these that we realize we have to put politics aside and work together as Americans. The coronavirus doesn’t care if you’re a Democrat or Republican. It will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender, or your zip code. It will touch people in positions of power as well as the most vulnerable people in our society,"" he said.

President Trump praised Andrew Cuomo for doing a “really great job” on the coronavirus Tuesday — just a day after slamming the governor on Twitter. The president told reporters at the White House he had a “great talk” with Cuomo Tuesday morning and that they are working together on COVID-19, including to set up new hospitals requested by Cuomo.

He added that a “hotspot” of virus transmission in New York is “not the fault of anybody.” New York now has the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the US. As of Tuesday morning, there were nearly 1,400. Washington state is second with fewer than 1,000 cases. The tone was a dramatic contrast from Monday’s social media sniping, with Trump writing “Cuomo of New York has to ‘do more’,” and the governor hitting back: “Happy to do your job, too.

Bloomberg Philanthropies, the ex-mayor’s charitable organization, said it will use the funds to slow the spread of COVID-19 in vulnerable low- and middle-income countries. It will fund rapid response teams to prevent and detect infection, train health care workers, develop lab networks to amplify testing capabilities, and measure containment strategies and the cancellation of mass gatherings.

"                          Reaction from Arizona GOP chairwoman Dr. Kelli Ward. President Trump has officially secured the 2020 Republican presidential nomination after victories in the Florida and Illinois primaries Tuesday, according to an Associated Press delegate count. Trump surpassed the 1,276 delegates needed to secure the nomination two months earlier than he did in 2016, when he battled a huge field of rivals as an insurgent candidate. BIDEN PROJECTED TO WIN FLORIDA AND ILLINOIS PRIMARIES, WITH POLLS SET TO CLOSE SOON IN ARIZONA ""Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump  - the presumptive 2020 Republican nominee for President!"" Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeted Tuesday evening. Trump's campaign says it shows the enthusiasm of Trump's voters and how unified Republicans are behind him as Democrats continue to wage a contested primary contest. This put an end to the longshot challenges that Trump faced, from candidates including former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh and former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford. None of the other candidates posed much of a threat, with only Weld winning any delegates. Weld won a single delegate at the Iowa caucuses.

"                          Mike Tobin reports from Chicago on why the state decided not to postpone voting. With Americans forced to self-isolate in their homes amid the coronavirus pandemic, turnout has been noticeably low in parts of Illinois, one of the three states holding presidential primaries on Tuesday. For comparison: Turnout in Chicago by early afternoon was less than half the level from the 2016 Democratic presidential primary, according to the city’s board of elections. CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC THREATENS TO UPEND REMAINING PRIMARIES, CONVENTIONS But election officials in Illinois, as well as in Arizona and Florida, the other two states holding primaries on Tuesday, were confident that a surge in early voting and mail-in ballots could make up for the drop in voting on primary day. In recent days, election officials in all three states relocated some polling stations that were originally set to be located in senior centers or nursing homes. Senior citizens are most at risk from the coronavirus, which is officially known as COVID-19. Concerns about the outbreak likely caused some poll workers in Florida and Illinois to stay home on Tuesday.  The relocating of polling sites in Florida led to some disruptions, and low turnout was reported in some counties while voting was going smoothly in other locations. There were no major issues reported by early afternoon in Arizona – where most voters had cast their ballots before primary day. Most polls in Florida were set to close at 7 p.m. ET, with the western part of the state’s panhandle – which is located in the central time zone -- closing at 8 p.m. ET. Polls in Illinois were set to close at 8 p.m. ET and polls in Arizona were scheduled to shut down at 10 p.m. ET. On primary eve, Ohio’s governor used an emergency order to postpone his state’s contest after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) urged against any gatherings nationwide of 50 people or more. “We cannot conduct this election tomorrow,” Gov. Mike DeWine stressed. Mailing it in In an effort to keep voters and poll workers safe amid the coronavirus pandemic and prevent the postponement of primaries, the Democratic National Committee is calling on states that have upcoming presidential primary contests to offer options like voting by mail. “States can provide easy access to voting while still taking necessary precautions to protect the health and safety of the American people. In order to ensure the voices of voters are heard, the DNC is urging the remaining primary states to use a variety of other critical mechanisms that will make voting easier and safer for voters and election officials alike,” DNC chair Tom Perez urged in a Tuesday statement. Team Biden confident Former Vice President Joe Biden’s campaign is touting the early voter turnout. “While voter turnout on Election Day itself may be lower due to COVID-19 concerns, we believe that, with early vote and vote by mail, overall turnout will be roughly on pace for 2016 in Arizona and Florida and roughly on pace for 2018 in Illinois, and that voter turnout in all three states will reflect the population at large,” Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield highlighted in a memo sent to reporters on Tuesday afternoon. The campaign spotlighted the high numbers of older voters – and voters of color – who were casting ballots in all three states. The former vice president enjoyed strong support from older voters and African Americans, while his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination – Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont – has struggled to resonate with such voters. PRIMARIES GO AHEAD IN THREE STATES AS BIDEN ATTEMPS TO SHUT OUT SANDERS Sanders – a progressive champion who’s making his second straight White House run -- was the front-runner in the race for much of February thanks to a partial victory in Iowa’s caucuses, an outright win in New Hampshire’s primary, and a shellacking of the rest of the Democratic field of contenders in Nevada’s caucuses. But over the last two and a half weeks, Sanders has watched Joe Biden zoom past him in the race for the presidential nomination. Following a landslide win in South Carolina’s primary and sweeping victories in the coast-to-coast Super Tuesday states as well as last week’s mini Super Tuesday, the former vice president cemented his position as the unrivaled front-runner and has taken a commanding lead over Sanders in the all-important race for convention delegates. The Biden campaign – in its memo – said, “We expect to emerge tonight with a bigger delegate lead than we had going into the night.” And they argued, “It would take a drastic, historically-incomparable swing for Senator Sanders to win more delegates than Biden today or to close the delegate differential.” 'This primary is far from over' Pre-primary public opinion polls indicated Biden enjoying large leads in all three states. And if Tuesday’s contests deliver another round of decisive victories by the former vice president, the chorus of calls for Sanders to step aside will grow louder. But Biden will still be short of the 1,991 pledged delegates needed to clinch the nomination. And with the primary calendar likely grinding to a halt after Tuesday's contests due to the coronavirus pandemic, there’s the possibility that Sanders could stay alive in a race that will be frozen in time. On Monday, Sanders didn’t sound like a candidate ready to call it quits. “This primary is far from over,” Sanders stressed in an email to supporters on the eve of Tuesday’s contests. And on Tuesday, the Sanders campaign spotlighted that three virtual campaign events they held the past three days “amassed 5.3 million views in total.”“Our digital organizing infrastructure is unmatched,” Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir emphasized. And the Sanders campaign was also spotlighting on Tuesday its hands-off approach to trying to get their supporters to the polls – and emphasizing that health concerns take precedent. “We are not doing traditional GOTV outreach in states holding primary contests today. We are making clear to voters that we believe going to the polls amid the coronavirus outbreak is a personal decision and we respect whichever choice they make. We are also passing along guidance from the CDC on staying safe during the crisis,” Sanders communications director Mike Casca said in a statement.

"                          The choices we make as individuals will collectively make a big difference to the pandemic, says Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. A landslide in Florida.  A blow out in Illinois. And a victory as well in Arizona – giving former Vice President Joe Biden a clean sweep on Tuesday and effectively shutting the door to any possible pathway for rival Sen. Bernie Sanders to win the Democratic presidential nomination. The convincing victories came as the primary calendar is likely to grind to a halt due to the coronavirus pandemic, freezing the Democratic presidential nomination race in place. BIDEN CRUSHES SANDERS IN PRIMARY SWEEP ON TUESDAY NIGHT Sanders - the populist senator from Vermont who’s making his second straight White House bid  - now faces the toughest decision of his political career as he struggles with deciding when to bring an end to his presidential campaign but ensure that his political revolution continues the fight. Biden speaking from his home in Wilmington, Del., declared that “our campaign has had a very good night.” “We moved closer to securing the Democratic Party’s nomination for president.  And we’re doing it by building a broad coalition that we need to win in November,” the former vice president emphasized. Biden crushed Sanders in Florida by nearly 40 percentage points.  With 215 delegates up for grabs, Florida was the biggest prize in Tuesday’s contests. But it’s also the biggest of the battleground or swing states that will determine whether President Trump or the Democratic nominee will win November’s general election. CLICK HERE FOR LATEST RESULTS  A Fox News voter analysis shows that Biden cleaned up among Hispanic voters – who made up a fifth of the state’s primary electorate – as well as with voters over the age of 65 – who made up a third of all primary voters. Biden also shellacked Sanders in Illinois – where 155 delegates were at stake. A strong showing with African Americans and white working-class voters boosted Biden. And in all three states voters said Biden was better positioned than Sanders to defeat the president in November’s general election, according to the Fox News Voter analysis. The victories significantly boosted Biden’s already wide lead over Sanders in the crucial race for convention delegates. THE FOX NEWS DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION DELEGATE TRACKER “It is hard to see a mathematical path for Bernie Sanders to win the nomination. Joe Biden is the presumptive nominee.  Biden is building and winning the large, diverse population that Sanders said he would win,” said Mo Elleithee, the founding executive director of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service and a Fox News contributor. Elleithee, a senior spokesman for Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign who later served as communications director for the Democratic National Committee, stressed that “Sanders still has a chance to impact the debate and the party platform. But Joe Biden is the candidate who will face President Trump in November.” For a second straight week, Biden extended an olive branch to Sanders and his legions of young supporters.  “Sen. Sanders and I may disagree on tactics but we share a common vision for the need to provide affordable health care for all Americans… to tackling the existential threat of our time – climate change,” Biden said. “Sen. Sanders and his supporters have brought a remarkable passion and tenacity to all of these issues. Together they’ve shifted the fundamental conversation in this country.” In an attempt to unify the party as he tries to boot Trump from the White House in November’s election, Biden said “let me say especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Sen. Sanders – I near you. I know what’s at stake. I know what we have to do. Our goal as a campaign and my goal as a candidate for president is to unify this party, and then to unify the nation.” After losing five of the six states that held contests last week,  Sanders vowed to continue on in an attempt to push Biden to the left. For a second straight week, Sanders didn’t deliver a primary night speech. Instead – earlier in the evening – Sanders gave an address on his proposals to combat the coronavirus outbreak and the economic downturn spurred by the pandemic. His plan – with a $2 trillion price tag – called for $2000 per month checks to help families dealing with the burgeoning economic downturn caused by the coronavirus. Sanders made no mention of Tuesday’s contests.  Now – as calls for him to suspend his campaign and back Biden are likely to grow as the math doesn’t add up anymore for the senator – Sanders will need to make on a decision on what’s best not just for his campaign but for this wider movement.  And that’s a decision he’ll likely make with major input from his wife Jane – who’s also a senior adviser on the campaign.

"                          Coronavirus task force gives update on outbreak response at the White House. We are finally -- thankfully -- in the midst of a full-scale national mobilization to minimize the impact of this dreaded virus. President Trump has finally -- thankfully -- changed his tone about what he now calls an “invisible enemy,” and saying of the situation, “it’s bad.” In ordering more sweeping action, the president now says the virus may not peak until July or August. Man, have we lost a lot of time. As recently as three days ago, Trump was saying such things as “just relax,” “it will all pass,” and “we’re going to all be great.” THE VIRUS ERA: HITS AND MISSES BY TRUMP, BIDEN AND SANDERS By the time the president shifted gears, many governors, mayors and business leaders had already taken drastic steps, closing down colleges and schools, restaurants, theaters and sports clubs. It seemed radical when California and New York barred gatherings of more than 250 or 500 people; Trump is now telling Americans not to hang out with more than 10 people. What changed? One factor, according to the New York Times, is a British report finding that “without action by the government and individuals to slow the spread of coronavirus and suppress new cases, 2.2 million people in the United States could die.” Deborah Birx, a leader of the White House task force, said the administration viewed the report as important. But the British researchers shared the findings with the White House about a week ago. Not surprisingly, the president is taking a hit in the polls. In a NPR/PBS “NewsHour” survey, 37 percent say they have a good amount or a great deal of trust in virus information they hear from Trump, while 60 percent say they don’t have very much trust in the president’s words. Meanwhile, despite the new mood of national seriousness, Trump has been getting into spats with Democratic governors about the virus response. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said on MSNBC that “to hear the leader of the federal government telling us to work around the federal government because it’s too slow, it’s kind of mind-boggling, to be honest.” The president tweeted: “Failing Michigan Governor must work harder and be much more proactive. We are pushing her to get the job done. I stand with Michigan.” Similarly, after Andrew Cuomo said the feds need to do more, Trump tweeted yesterday that the New York governor wants “all states to be treated the same,” but “all states aren’t the same...Andrew, keep politics out of it.” Cuomo’s response: “YOU have to do something! You’re supposed to be the president.” There was a cease-fire hours later, though, however, when Cuomo told reporters he takes Trump at his word that he’ll try to help New York. The president said he and Cuomo are both doing a good job. The big headline out of yesterday’s White House presser was Steve Mnuchin saying they want to start sending Americans checks over the next two weeks to cushion the financial blow of the crisis. The Treasury chief provided no details, but did say that millionaires shouldn’t get such checks, indicating some type of means test. The White House had favored a payroll tax cut, but that would take months to have much impact. Obviously sensitive to criticism over his earlier efforts to downplay the virus, Trump said yesterday he “felt this was a pandemic long before it was a pandemic.” There is still something of a zig-zag pattern to the virus debate: Appeals to national unity are interspersed with partisan sniping on both sides. There’s no way to take politics completely out of the process, but I think Americans would appreciate a greater sense of cooperation, which has been MIA in Washington in recent years. SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES My business is also getting failing grades. In a new Morning Consult/Hollywood Reporter poll, exactly half of those questioned believe the media are overhyping the virus crisis. The survey found that just 17 percent of respondents have “a lot” of trust in virus information provided by network news. For newspapers the figure was 14 percent, and 13 percent for cable news networks. That is a vote of no confidence, and puts these media outlets behind the relatively low scores for Trump (20 percent) and Mike Pence (18 percent). And the most trusted on the coronavirus: the CDC (50 percent) and WHO (43 percent). That faith in medical experts helps explain why Trump has Anthony Fauci play such a front-and-center role at the daily briefings.

Following his overwhelming losses Tuesday to former Vice President Joe Biden in Democratic presidential primaries in Florida, Illinois and Arizona, Sen. Bernie Sanders needs to face the fact that Biden will be the party’s presidential nominee. In the interest of party unity and to help send President Trump into retirement, it’s time for Sanders to end his presidential campaign. Voters across the country have clearly have shown that they prefer Biden’s message of pragmatic progressive change to Sanders’ calls for a democratic socialist revolution.

And Democratic voters across the country have said in many polls that defeating Trump is their top priority. Here are some takeaways from the three primaries held Tuesday: Biden won big Biden’s margin of victory over Sanders was nearly 40 points in Florida and 23 points in Illinois with almost all votes counted, and about 12 points in Arizona with 87 percent of precincts reporting. And Biden received strong support from African-Americans; rural and suburban voters; Catholics, Protestants and Jews; blue-collar workers; and older voters. Biden won every county in Florida. This broad support cuts the legs out from under Sanders’ argument that he is the candidate of the people while Biden is the candidate of the Democratic establishment and billionaire donors.  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Latino and younger voters are warming to Biden Biden chipped away at Sanders’ coalition of progressive young people and Latinos. In Florida, exit polls showed Biden got 56 percent of the Cuban-American vote and 65 percent of the Puerto Rican vote. And among progressive voters in Florida, Biden won 53 percent to Sanders’ 37 percent. The coronavirus is a top concern for voters The coronavirus has replaced health care as the top concern among many voters and their concern continues to grow.  In both Florida and Illinois, more voters said they trusted Biden on health care issues than Sanders. In speeches Tuesday night both Biden and Sanders spoke of the need to protect Americans from the coronavirus pandemic. But Sanders touted his costly and controversial “Medicare-for-all” plan, while Biden spoke of unity and said Americans must come together on a bipartisan basis battle the virus that is sweeping across the world. Most voters in all three of the states with primaries Tuesday said they have anxieties about contracting COVID-19. As many as 40 percent in Florida are very concerned that they or a family member could become infected and about a third in Illinois and Arizona feel the same way.

If Sanders continues to battle Biden in remaining primaries, the only thing he will accomplish is to strengthen Trump’s reelection chances.

"                          A look at what's in&nbsp;Bernie Sanders' coronavirus plan The Democratic presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders said Wednesday the Vermont senator will spend the next several weeks assessing the future of his campaign after a string of losses to former Vice President Joe Biden. “The next primary contest is at least three weeks away. Sen. Sanders is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign,” Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement Wednesday morning. “In the immediate term, however, he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and ensuring that we take care of working people and the most vulnerable,” Shakir added. SANDERS AT CROSSROADS AS BIDEN'S LEAD GROWS AND CORONAVIRUS FREEZES RACE Shakir’s comments came the morning after the populist senator from Vermont was swept in Tuesday’s three Democratic presidential nomination primaries by Biden. The former vice president’s landslide victory in Florida, his crushing defeat of Sanders in Illinois, and his win in Arizona cemented his status as the presumptive Democratic nominee and all but closed the senator’s extremely narrow path for any potential comeback to win the nomination. On Tuesday, for a second straight week, Sanders didn’t deliver a primary night speech. Instead, earlier in the evening, the senator delivered an address on the nation’s response coronavirus outbreak. His plan – which he acknowledges comes with a $2 trillion price tag – called for $2,000 per month checks to help families dealing with the burgeoning economic downturn caused by the coronavirus. Sanders made no mention during those comments of Tuesday’s contests, which may be the last to be held in the Democratic race for quite some time. As most Americans self-isolate at home as the coronavirus pandemic sweeps the nation, states with upcoming primaries and caucuses are quickly postponing their nominating contests. CORONAVIRUS UPENDS PRIMARY CALENDAR, EVEN THREATENS SUMMER CONVENTIONS Now, as calls for him to suspend his campaign and back Biden are likely to grow as the math doesn’t add up anymore for the senator, Sanders will need to make a decision on what’s best not just for his campaign but to make sure that his political revolution continues the progressive fight. And that’s a decision he’ll likely make with major input from his wife Jane – who’s also a senior adviser on the campaign.

"                          The foreign ministry wants journalists working for the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post to hand back their press cards within 10 days. The war of words between the Trump administration and China over the origin of coronavirus has escalated as President Trump is going out of his way to call it the ""Chinese Virus"" and China has embarked on a propaganda campaign to shift blame for the pandemic away from the Chinese Communist Party's handling of the crisis. The escalation comes as the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread in the United States, shutting down sporting events, restaurants, bars and elections across the country. ""I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously,"" Trump tweeted Wednesday morning, commenting on news coverage about his response to the pandemic -- one of three Wednesday morning tweets referencing the ""Chinese Virus."" CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW TRUMP TELLS PEOPLE OUT OF WORK OVER CORONAVIRUS THAT 'MONEY WILL SOON BE COMING TO YOU' Minutes earlier he tweeted: ""I will be having a news conference today to discuss very important news from the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] concerning the Chinese Virus!"" Trump also repeatedly called the pathogen, which causes a disease officially called COVID-19, the ""Chinese virus,"" in remarks at a White House coronavirus briefing Tuesday afternoon. CORONAVIRUS CASES TOP 200,000 WORLDWIDE, DEATH TOLL PASSES 8,000 Almost simultaneously, China moved to continue its propaganda war over the coronavirus by kicking out a subset of journalists from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post whose press credentials would expire before the end of this year. ""The Chinese Communist Party's decision to expel journalists from China and Hong Kong is yet another step toward depriving the Chinese people and the World of access to true information about China,"" the White House's National Security Council tweeted Tuesday in response to the decision. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HITS BACK AFTER CHINA KICKS OUT US JOURNALISTS AMID CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has also stepped into the fray. On Monday he called People’s Republic of China Politburo member Yang Jiechi to push back on a tweet from the deputy director-general for the Chinese Foreign Ministry's Information Department. The deputy director-general, Lijian Zhao, tweeted that the United States military might be responsible for the coronavirus. He provided no evidence to that effect. ""Secretary Pompeo conveyed strong U.S. objections to PRC efforts to shift blame for COVID-19 to the United States,"" State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said in a Monday statement. ""The secretary stressed that this is not the time to spread disinformation and outlandish rumors, but rather a time for all nations to come together to fight this common threat."" This comes as a variety of American officials continue to tailor their language around the coronavirus to call it the ""Wuhan virus"" or ""Chinese coronavirus"" over the objections of China and American liberals who have said that calling the coronavirus anything that indicates it is from China or Wuhan, the city in China where the virus is from, is racist. That list includes Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Pompeo himself. POMPEO CONDEMNS CHINA'S 'EFFORTS TO SHIFT' CORONAVIRUS BLAME ON US IN CALL WITH COMMUNIST PARTY OFFICIAL Zhao, whose job is essentially to spread propaganda for China's oppressive regime – which has detained between one and five million Uighur Muslims in ""re-education"" camps that are essentially forced labor or concentration camps – has been sharing glowing stories of China's global response to the coronavirus despite the fact the nation's lack of transparency during its initial spread contributed to the seriousness of the pandemic. As early as last Wednesday Trump National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien was clearly assigning China with the responsibility for the coronavirus pandemic. ""Unfortunately, rather than using best practices, this outbreak in Wuhan was covered up,"" O'Brien said at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative-leaning think tank in Washington. ""There's lots of open-source reporting from China, from Chinese nationals, that the doctors involved were either silenced or put in isolation, or that sort of thing, so that the word of this virus could not get out. It probably cost the world community two months."" Zhao has also shared comments by Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Geng Shuang saying American efforts to move its medical supply chain back from the communist nation are ""unrealistic and unhelpful"" after China hinted at reducing its medical exports to the U.S., plunging America into ""the mighty sea of coronavirus."" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., has introduced a bill in the Senate aimed at doing just that. ""We’re looking at potential shortages of up to 150 commonly prescribed antibiotics and anti-viral medications,"" Hawley explained on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" last month. ""That’s bad. The problem is in whole or in part, these drugs are made in China.""

""For the people that are now out of work because of the important and necessary containment policies, for instance the shutting down of hotels, bars and restaurants, money will soon be coming to you,"" Trump tweeted. ""The onslaught of the Chinese Virus is not your fault!

The White House announced Wednesday that a visit next month by the king and queen of Spain would be postponed in order to allow both countries to give their full attention to the coronavirus pandemic. “In order for the United States and Spain to continue to devote their full resources and attention to the COVID-19 response, the April 21, 2020, White House State Visit by Their Majesties King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain has been postponed,” the White House said in a statement.

"                          Administration officials hope to convince congressional Republicans to pony up hundreds of billions of dollars to keep businesses and taxpayers afloat; chief White House correspondent John Roberts reports. President Trump, in an attempt to calm the thousands of Americans who have applied for unemployment or have been furloughed due to the spread of coronavirus, said Wednesday that “money will soon be coming to you,” while stressing that the virus outbreak is not the “fault” of workers. “For the people that are now out of work because of the important and necessary containment policies, for instance the shutting down of hotels, bars and restaurants, money will soon be coming to you,” he tweeted Wednesday. “The onslaught of the Chinese Virus is not your fault! Will be stronger than ever,” he continued, adding that he “will totally protect your Medicare & Social Security!” The president’s tweet comes after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Tuesday said that the federal government is looking to send checks to Americans “in the next two weeks” in an effort to help people cope with the economic fallout due to the coronavirus pandemic. TRUMP WANTS TO SEND CHECKS TO AMERICAN FAMILIES 'IMMEDIATELY,' MNUCHIN SAYS  “We’re looking at sending checks to Americans immediately,” Mnuchin said Tuesday during a press conference from the White House. “Americans need cash now, the president wants to get cash now. I mean now—in the next few weeks.” Mnuchin added: “The president has instructed me we have to do this now.” Mnuchin did not offer specifics during the press briefing on Tuesday, except to say that the amount sent to American families would be significant and that millionaires would not receive the relief. Fox News has learned, however, that Mnuchin is pressing GOP senators for a package that would send more than $200 billion of payments to Americans by early April. The White House is currently in negotiations with lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Congress to approve a sweeping economic stimulus package of nearly $850 billion to help U.S. businesses and taxpayers deal with the economic fallout from the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus. Despite the fact that businesses have closed and instituted telework policies for employees due to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention containment guidelines to stem the spread of the virus, Mnuchin said the Trump administration would not extend the April 15 deadline to file taxes, noting that much of the tax filing can be done online. “We encourage Americans who can file taxes to continue to file taxes on April 15 because for many Americans, you will get tax refunds and we don’t want you to lose out on those tax refunds,” he said. Mnuchin added that if individuals or corporations owe money to the Internal Revenue Service after filing their taxes, those payments now are able to be deferred for up to 90 days, interest-free. “If you owe a payment to the IRS, you can defer up to $1 million as an individual, and $10 million to corporations, interest-free and penalty-free for 90 days,” Mnuchin continued. “File your taxes, you’ll automatically not get charged interests or penalties.” The World Health Organization designated COVID-19 a global pandemic last week.

The president also announced a temporary halt on air travel to the United States from Europe, now including flights from the United Kingdom, but excluding those carrying cargo. When asked Tuesday whether he would limit domestic travel, the president replied: “It’s possible.” The coronavirus task force also predicted Tuesday that the number of cases in the U.S. could peak in approximately 45-days.

"                          Ohio postpones primary over coronavirus concerns; Ohio Governor Mark DeWine speaks out. The day after Ohio postponed its primary elections due to concerns about spreading the coronavirus -- and despite a recommendation from Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, that the state hold its election on June 2 -- there is still not a clear plan for when or how Ohio voters will cast their ballots in their primary elections. Amid growing fears of the spread of the coronavirus, and warnings from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention against large gatherings, DeWine filed a suit Monday in a lower court to get the state's primary elections postponed. The court ruled against him, and DeWine decided that he would keep the polls closed anyway, ordering state Director of Health Dr. Amy Action to use broad powers given to her under Ohio law to prevent the spread of disease to order the election be stopped. ""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,"" DeWine said when announcing the decision. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW TRUMP ANNOUNCES TELEHEALTH SERVICES WILL EXPAND FOR SENIORS The Ohio Supreme Court then early Tuesday morning refused to grant an 11th-hour request to force DeWine to hold the election, giving at least a tacit legal endorsement of the governor's move. But unlike other states, an election day can only be set by the state legislature or a court in Ohio. Because of that, when DeWine declared that he would not allow polls to open Tuesday for public health reasons, neither he nor anybody in his administration had the authority to actually change the election to a new date as has happened in other states. So, as of Wednesday morning, Ohio voters have not yet had their say in who will be the Democratic nominee for president or in primaries for a variety of other offices, and they don't have any set alternative to cast their ballots. There also appears to be no consensus idea for how or when to hold the primaries. DeWine and Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose indicated that they wanted to move the primary to June 2, and LaRose essentially declared it so in a directive issued Monday. ""On Tuesday, June 2, 2020, boards of elections must conduct in-person voting at polling locations in their county,"" the directive reads. That directive is linked to voter information web pages including the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections and the Ohio Democratic County Chairs Association. LOS ANGELES VOTES TO LET HOMELESS KEEP TENTS UP DURING DAY AMID CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK That directive from the Republican LaRose drew harsh criticism from House Minority Leader, Democrat Emilia Sykes, for what she said was ""sharing inaccurate information during a time of chaos when Ohioans are turning to him for truth and guidance."" ""As the state's chief election officer, Secretary LaRose is uniquely charged with the proper execution of a fair election in the state of Ohio. That includes sharing accurate information. What has transpired in recent hours has been anything but,"" Sykes said in a Tuesday statement. ""Now in the hours following the chaos, he continues to send out press releases and share information on his website saying the election day has been moved to June 2nd. That is just wrong. As the governor has noted, and state law requires, only the legislature or the court has the power to set or change the election date and thus far, neither entity has done that. Yet LaRose continues to suggest people can continue to vote absentee in direct violation of state law. This too is wrong."" The state's Democratic Pary chairman, David Pepper, has said that he does not think a June 2 election is sufficient and also made clear that neither DeWine nor LaRose can unilaterally set a new election day. FOX NEWS VOTER ANALYSIS: BIDEN WINS BIG, CORONAVIRUS ON VOTERS' MINDS ""Unfortunately, the proposed June 2 in-person primary arguably lacked legal authority but also brought with it major problems,"" Pepper said in a statement on Facebook Tuesday night. ""The lateness of it is highly problematic for a host of reasons, including missing deadlines to send delegates to nominating conventions. And it is iffy to think this virus crisis will be resolved by then to even have in-person voting."" Pepper did, however, indicate that DeWine was open to working on multiple possibilities, saying the governor had indicated ""that there was no 'magic' to his June 2 proposal."" In a statement on behalf of the state Democratic Party, Pepper said it had filed a suit with the Ohio Supreme Court to ensure that no legal technicalities ended up preventing Ohio voters from getting their chance to cast a ballot. JUSSIE SMOLLETT PROSECUTOR KIM FOXX WINS DEM PRIMARY IN HOTLY CONTESTED RACE ""Earlier today we said that we would litigate to defend voters’ right to fully participate in the state’s Democratic primary election, and in the absence of action by the General Assembly and with other actors moving to shut down the primary, we have filed with the Ohio Supreme Court to ensure that all eligible Ohio voters are able to exercise their right to vote in this primary,"" Pepper said. ""Yesterday’s actions did not create unchecked authority with the governor or secretary of state to run a new election. So authority for a new election must come from the legislature or from a court."" On ways to potentially hold an election, Pepper said on Fox News Tuesday afternoon that he would prefer extended vote-by-mail and potentially a curbside drop-off voting option. Apparently understanding that they would have to go through further steps in either the legislature or the courts, DeWine and LaRose issued a joint statement Tuesday scaling back the ""must[s]"" used in LaRose's Monday night directive to strong suggestions for how Ohioans should be able to vote in their primaries. ""Last night, the actions taken by Ohio Department of Health Director Dr. Amy Acton saved Ohio lives,"" the statement read. ""By preventing Ohioans from going to polling locations, we averted a situation which would have gone against the most recent scientific evidence available and could have dangerously advanced the spread of coronavirus across Ohio."" It continued: ""As we move forward, it is vitally important that Ohioans have a significant period of time to cast mail-in absentee ballots and an opportunity to vote in-person, as was provided in the directive issued last night by the Secretary of State."" SANDERS AT CROSSROADS, AS BIDEN EXPANDS LEAD AND CORONAVIRUS PANIC FREEZES ELECTION CALENDAR On the legislative side of things, Republican Senate President Larry Obhof issued a statement Tuesday afternoon saying he would work with LaRose and DeWine to find a legislative solution to Ohio's election confusion. ""We recognize the difficult position the state is in and the need to protect public health, while maintaining citizens' access to all of their rights, including the right to vote,"" Obhof said. ""The Senate will work collaboratively with the Governor and the Secretary of State in the coming days on any legislation necessary to deal with this unique and challenging set of circumstances, including determining a new date for the primary election... I believe that it is important for the Governor, Secretary of State, and legislature to work together in this time of crisis."" State Senate Minority Leader Kenny Yuko, a Democrat, also said that he thinks the legislature should be the body that addresses how a new election should be held. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""The legislature has to quickly address the confusion caused by moving the primary election on such short notice,"" he said in a statement. ""The fate of many community levies and local issues hangs in the balance and wrapping up the primary before June 2 should still be on the table... Our caucus will be putting forward our ideas on how to address this, and other critical issues facing Ohioans, before our next session day."" By the time Ohio straightens out its election situation, however, it appears unlikely its votes will matter in the presidential primaries. President Trump clinched the GOP nomination for president Tuesday and former Vice President Joe Biden expanded his delegate lead over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders with wins in the three states that did hold elections Tuesday -- Arizona, Florida and Illinois. But Yuko is correct that Ohioans will still have other local races and issues to decide once it figures out how it will hold its postponed elections, whenever and however that is.

The president’s daughter’s post called for families to make the best of their time at home together during the coronavirus outbreak, suggesting they have a “living room camp out” along with sandwiches and other treats. “A fun activity that also brings family together for a meal!” the 38-year-old Trump wrote.

Then, mocking Trump’s tweet, Omar invited the first daughter to “Share your ideas on how you plan to unite them.” The Minnesota Democrat’s response drew numerous critical reactions, with many suggesting that Omar’s recent divorce and subsequent remarriage – to a man with whom she was allegedly having an extramarital affair – made her unqualified to criticize another woman’s comments on the subject of family. “Why do you need to be so hateful?” one responder asked Omar. “Ivanka shared a simple family suggestion and you had to be spiteful and mean. Not something a true leader would do. Awful. I’m praying for this country to heal in all ways. You should try it.” ""Why do you need to be so hateful?

Sanders is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign,” Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement Wednesday morning. “In the immediate term, however, he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and ensuring that we take care of working people and the most vulnerable,” Shakir added.

Once there, they’ll begin holding conversations with supporters to get input and assess the path forward for our campaign. We will keep you updated as those conversations progress.” Shakir’s comments came the morning after the populist senator from Vermont was swept in Tuesday’s three Democratic presidential nomination primaries by Biden. The former vice president’s landslide victory in Florida, his crushing defeat of Sanders in Illinois, and his win in Arizona cemented his status as the presumptive Democratic nominee and all but closed the senator’s extremely narrow path for any potential comeback to win the nomination. On Tuesday, for a second straight week, Sanders didn’t deliver a primary night speech. Instead, earlier in the evening, the senator delivered an address on the nation’s response coronavirus outbreak. His plan – which he acknowledges comes with a $2 trillion price tag – called for $2,000 per month checks to help families dealing with the burgeoning economic downturn caused by the coronavirus. Sanders made no mention during those comments of Tuesday’s contests, which may be the last to be held in the Democratic race for quite some time. As most Americans self-isolate at home as the coronavirus pandemic sweeps the nation, states with upcoming primaries and caucuses are quickly postponing their nominating contests.

"                          Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says the economy is slowing to a standstill as COVID-19 spreads. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer warned Wednesday that the U.S. will “almost certainly” see a recession due to the effects of the rapidly spreading coronavirus. During remarks on the Senate floor, Schumer, D-N.Y., said the novel coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, “continues to test our nation in new and difficult ways.” TRUMP TELLS PEOPLE 'MONEY WILL SOON BE COMING TO YOU' “Our public health system is understaffed and under-resourced and without intervention, it could soon become overwhelmed,” Schumer said. “Even as the market shifts from day to day, coronavirus is slowing our economy to a near standstill and we’re almost certainly anticipating a recession,” he continued. “Go to the streets of many cities, towns and villages—they’re empty. Schools are closed in large portions of the country and businesses are struggling not to lay off workers because they don’t have customers, don’t have clients, don’t have income.” Schumer went on to say that there “is a great urgency here.” President Trump previously said a recession is possible. On Wednesday, in the opening minutes of trading, U.S. equity markets plunged, removing all gains from earlier in the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,268 points, or 5.9 percent, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were lower by 5.4 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively. Trading is halted if the S&P 500 falls by 7 percent. The instability in the markets came as the Trump administration was negotiating with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to hammer out the details of a stimulus package that could reach $1 trillion to help U.S. businesses and taxpayers deal with the economic fallout. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, opening the Senate on Tuesday morning, promised swift action, though there is no clear timeline on when the Senate will vote on the package. ""The Senate will not adjourn until we have passed significant and bold new steps above and beyond what the House has passed to help our strong nation and our strong underlying economy weather this storm,"" McConnell said. The Trump administration’s stimulus package is bigger than the 2008 bank bailout, and the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which was passed and signed under former President Barack Obama, and totaled $787 billion to help stabilize the economy about 14 months after the last recession began. MARKET PLUNGES, OIL CRATERS AS CONGRESS WEIGHS $1 TRILLION STIMULUS Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday that President Trump wants him to send checks to Americans within “the next two weeks” in an effort to help people cope with the economic fallout due to the COVID-19 spread. Trump, on Wednesday, in an attempt to calm the thousands of Americans who have already applied for unemployment or have been furloughed due to the spread of the virus, said that “money will soon be coming to you.” “For the people that are now out of work because of the important and necessary containment policies, for instance the shutting down of hotels, bars and restaurants, money will soon be coming to you,” he tweeted Wednesday. The World Health Organization designated COVID-19 a global pandemic last week. Trump announced a national emergency on Friday. The president also announced a temporary halt on air travel to the United States from Europe, now including flights from the United Kingdom, but excluding those carrying cargo. When asked Tuesday whether he would limit domestic travel, the president replied: “It’s possible.” The coronavirus task force also predicted Tuesday that the number of cases in the U.S. could peak in approximately 45 days. As of Wednesday morning, there were more than 6,500 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States, in all 50 states, including Washington, D.C. The U.S., so far, has seen 115 coronavirus-related deaths.

"                          Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell provides updates on the coronavirus funding bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., vowed Wednesday that the Senate will not rest until it passes legislation to help Americans facing the economic effects of the coronavirus outbreak, vowing a “historic injection of liquidity” to boost the economy. McConnell said that while the Senate will pass the House’s latest bill, they still need to pass additional legislation to help small businesses, which he said are left vulnerable even under the House bill. CORONAVIRUS CASES TOP 200,000 WORLDWIDE, DEATH TOLL PASSES 8,000 “Everyone agrees that workers need relief. Republicans are working on bold solutions to help individuals and families as we speak, but small businesses need relief as well,” McConnell said on the Senate floor Wednesday morning. The Kentucky Republican cited restrictions that his home state will be imposing that include the forced closures of bars and restaurants, similar to what is already taking place in New York City and elsewhere. “Nobody expects main street small businesses of any sort to hold the kind of cash buffer they would need to remain in business and wait out a national economic disruption that could last for weeks or months,” McConnell said. “They need help. They need a lifeline.” That lifeline, McConnell explained, will be in the form of a “historic injection of liquidity and access to credit,” and “Washington working directly with the lenders who already work with these small businesses to minimize the new bureaucracy so the assistance can flow as fast as possible.” TRUMP ANNOUNCES US, CANADA CLOSING BORDER TO 'NON-ESSENTIAL TRAFFIC' AMID CORONAVIRUS FEARS McConnell reiterated that the Senate will pass the House bill and that its “imperfections will just make our more comprehensive package even more urgent.” He promised that he and his fellow senators will keep working until it gets done. “The Senate is not going to leave small business behind,” he said. But the aid to small businesses is “just one component” of the Senate’s work, McConnell said, adding that senators are currently looking at “the best pathway to put money directly in the hands of the American people.” Sending checks directly to Americans is a concept that currently enjoys bipartisan support from figures including Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, as well as the White House. McConnell also discussed “targeted relief” for “key industries that are shouldering an outsized burden from the public health directives.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Republican leader also praised individual Americans for taking action as they wait for Congress to assist them, describing how some grocery stores are dedicating early hours specifically to senior citizens so those at risk can avoid crowds, and parents at home are volunteering to help with child care. “This is what makes the United States of America what it is, and it is what we are today,” he said. “Generosity, friendship, resolve, and strength. This is not a challenge anyone wanted for our nation, but it is a challenge we will overcome.”    ",         McConnell vows 'historic injection' of aid to save small businesses in face of coronavirus,         2020-03-18T112754-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/mcconnell-vows-historic-injection-of-aid-to-save-small-businesses-in-face-of-coronavirus,Fox

As the Trump impeachment saga raged on in December, the House Democrats' Twitter account posted that ""President Trump has abused his power and must be held accountable."" ""Democrats know they cannot win in this climate, and so they have decided to impeach the president,"" the Senate Republicans' account posted in January, quoting Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C. Twitter accounts for the House Republicans, Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, the Republican Governors Association and more have joined the House Democrats and Senate Republicans in putting down their political swords -- for now -- and instead sharing information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), updating Americans on national and state governments' latest actions and warning people about the potentially disastrous effects of allowing the coronavirus to go on unchecked. ER PHYSICIAN DIAGNOSED WITH CORONAVIRUS 'HORRIFIED' THAT HE MAY HAVE EXPOSED OTHERS Some accounts, including the Senate Democrats' official account and the National Republican Congressional Committee, have continued sharing partisan posts. But they are generally outnumbered by those which have focused on fighting the coronavirus, especially as the threat has become more serious in the United States in the past week -- a development that has led even President Trump to shift his initially dismissive tone on the disease. In remarks on the Senate floor Wednesday morning, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell updated the chamber on its latest efforts to pass a stimulus package before sharing some stories from his home state on individual Americans coming together to stem the spread of the virus which causes a disease officially known as COVID-19. ""Even amidst the uncertainty, the American people are stepping up and reminding everyone what solidarity and citizenship look like,"" McConnell said. ""In my home state, Kentuckians are going out of their way to stand with their neighbors. Stay at home parents are volunteering to help neighbors with childcare when parents are unable to telework. Grocery stores in the Lowell area are setting aside the first hour they're open each day, right after their cleaning, so older shoppers, and those with underlying conditions, can shop first.""

"                          Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says the economy is slowing to a standstill as COVID-19 spreads. Green New Deal activists released their long list of priorities for a coronavirus economic relief, pitching a $2,000 a month payment to Americans and a break from bills during the crisis. The former chief of staff to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted out the list of federal actions progressives will push for as Washington is moving swiftly on the third round of legislation to respond to the global pandemic. Comparing the federal response needed to Great Depression and World War II mobilizations, the activists want to suspend the rule requiring Treasury to issue new debt for financing to create ""debt-free money,"" demanding the Fed open its discount window lending immediately to small businesses and dropping ""helicopter money"" into taxpayers' bank, Venmo or PayPal accounts. The ask list, authored by the New Consensus activists behind the Green New Deal, also calls for direct support for small businesses, investment in building stockpiles of medical goods, foods and fuels, temporary suspension of certain tariffs and other trade impediments. AOC RIPS CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL AS 'COMPLETELY INSUFFICIENT,' CALLS FOR CASH INFUSIONS, REIMBURSING STUDENTS But perhaps the most immediate relief to workers would be $1,000 biweekly in universal basic income support for at least six months. The current proposals of $1,000 don't go far enough, they argue, and at least $2,000 month is needed for everyone. Consumers should also get a break from all their debt payments for six months, including credit card debt, student debt, mortgage and lease payments. There should also be a nationwide moratorium on debt and mortgage foreclosures, the activists said. The progressive groups are aligned with Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Some of the ideas have already gotten support from the politicians in a position to vote on such measures and influence policy. Sanders backed the $ 2,000-a-month proposal Tuesday night as he suffered another round of losses in his bid for the White House. CORONAVIRUS CASES TOP 200,000 WORLDWIDE, DEATH TOLL PASSES 8,000 ""We need to provide a direct emergency $2,000 cash payment to every household in American every month for the duration of the crisis,"" Sanders said. He also backed a hold on student loan payments, a moratorium on evictions and foreclosures, and expanding the eligibility for unemployment benefits to gig workers and freelancers and upping the benefits checks maximum to $75,000 a year. For her part, Ocasio-Cortez has also pitched big bold ideas, saying the response so far has been ""completely insufficient."" She's also pushing direct cash payments, suspending all rent, mortgage and debt payments, expanded unemployment insurance and universal health care. ""What people are dealing with is a liquidity issue,"" Ocasio-Cortez told 1010 WINS on Wednesday. ""While cutting checks is an important part of an equation, I don't think it's going to help if it's the only action that taken. We need to take a look at mortgage, rent and student loan payment suspension to give people that buffer time."" Ocasio-Cortez wants priority on public transit funds over airline relief and has pushed for free subway rides. She's blasted the airlines for using their profits to buy up stock rather than raising wages or making other investments. She's demanded a ban on stock buybacks if any federal bailout happens for corporate industries. ""I personally think that it's much more worthwhile for us to bail out our public transportation than the airline industry,"" Ocasio-Cortez told the radio station. ""...That investment in public infrastructure hasn't happened. I support federal funds to MTA  (Metropolitan Transportation Authority) and I personally would like to see the MTA be free or extraordinarily reduced."" Some Republicans, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Sen. Mitt Romney, have backed direct-cash payments. The administration is pushing a massive stimulus package. But progressives are leery that their ideas don't go far enough in terms of the length of payments, amount of money and scope of eligibility. Meanwhile, Sen. Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the Senate, is pushing his own $750 billion stimulus. It doesn't include direct payments to Americans but boosts public health capacity, expands unemployment benefits, provides low-interest loans to small businesses, cancels student loan payments and gives priority to workers in any targeted bailout of industries.

"                          New York hospitals only have a total of 53,000 beds; Laura Ingle reports New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday that President Trump agreed to dispatch a Navy hospital ship to the New York City Harbor to “add capacity” for those who need to be admitted due to complications of coronavirus. Cuomo has warned that the virus puts stress on New York state hospitals, and that the state’s hospital system only has 53,000 beds. For days, he has weighed how to create additional space for the expected influx of patients in the coming days and weeks due to the virus.  TRUMP TO SEND CHECKS TO AMERICANS IN COMING WEEKS, MNUCHIN SAYS Cuomo, during a press conference Wednesday, said that the president agreed to dispatch the USNS Comfort hospital ship, which the Pentagon offered as part of the domestic response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The USNS Comfort has 1,000 beds and is run by military personnel, according to the U.S. Naval Institute. “The president will dispatch it immediately,” Cuomo said, noting the ship will remain in New York City harbor. Cuomo added that New York City is the ""natural"" place for the ship to dock, noting the ""density"" of the population. NYC MAY ISSUE SHELTER-IN-PLACE ORDER OVER SPREAD OF COVID-19 ""We must increase the current hospital capacity,"" he said. After the press conference, Cuomo tweeted: ""The federal government is sending a hospital ship to New York, the USNS Comfort."" ""The Comfort, which has about 1,000 rooms on it, will be moored in New York Harbor,"" Cuomo continued. ""Hospital beds are what we need."" The announcement came after Cuomo repeatedly called for the Army Corps of Engineers to help build new hospitals to manage the outbreak. New York state currently has the most cases of coronavirus, or COVID-19, in the country with more than 1,700 positive cases reported by Wednesday morning, and 16 virus-related deaths. Defense Secretary Mark Esper told Fox News Tuesday that the U.S. military ""remains ready and capable of defending the American people, protecting the nation and safeguarding our interests abroad."" Field hospitals and a fleet of hospital ships could be called in to help with overflow capacity of infected patients, he said. The USNS Comfort was in port in Norfolk, Va. undergoing repairs after a six-month tour in South America and would not be ready to arrive in New York until ""mid April"" at the earliest.  At this point, efforts are being made to expedite the timeline. But Esper said that the ship's capabilities, and field hospitals, ""are focused on trauma,"" rather than infectious disease. ""Whether it's our field hospitals or our hospital ships, they are focused on trauma. They do not have necessarily the space, the segreated s[ace, to deal with infectious disease,"" Esper told Fox News' Bret Baier Tuesday. ""We don't have any 500 bed hospitals designed for infectious disease...That does not exist in the inventory."" The U.S. Navy said Wednesday that despite the dispatch to areas affected by COVID-19, the ships will not treat patients who have fallen ill with the virus. ""The Comfort and Mercy will not deploy to treat COVID patients, but will be made available to assist with treatment of other patients in coastal locations where local health professionals are necessarily focused on a large number of COVID cases,"" the Navy said in a statement. As of mid-day Wednesday, the U.S. currently had more than 7,300 confirmed cases of coronavirus in all 50 states, including Washington, D.C. The U.S., so far, has seen 115 COVID-19-related deaths.

"                          The foreign ministry wants journalists working for the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post to hand back their press cards within 10 days. The war of words between the Trump administration and China over the origin of coronavirus has escalated as President Trump is going out of his way to call it the ""Chinese Virus"" and China has embarked on a propaganda campaign to shift blame for the pandemic away from the Chinese Communist Party's handling of the crisis. The escalation comes as the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread in the United States, shutting down sporting events, restaurants, bars and elections across the country. ""I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously,"" Trump tweeted Wednesday morning, commenting on news coverage about his response to the pandemic -- one of three Wednesday morning tweets referencing the ""Chinese Virus."" CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW TRUMP TELLS PEOPLE OUT OF WORK OVER CORONAVIRUS THAT 'MONEY WILL SOON BE COMING TO YOU' Minutes earlier he tweeted: ""I will be having a news conference today to discuss very important news from the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] concerning the Chinese Virus!"" Trump also repeatedly called the pathogen, which causes a disease officially called COVID-19, the ""Chinese virus,"" in remarks at a White House coronavirus briefing Tuesday afternoon before doubling down Wednesday afternoon when asked about his terminology by a reporter, who commented, ""a lot of people say it's racist."" ""Because it's from China. It's not racist at all, no. Not at all. It comes from China,"" Trump said. ""That's why. It comes from China. I want to be accurate."" CORONAVIRUS CASES TOP 200,000 WORLDWIDE, DEATH TOLL PASSES 8,000 At nearly the same time Trump was speaking in his coronavirus briefing Tuesday, China moved to continue its propaganda war over the coronavirus by kicking out a subset of journalists from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post whose press credentials would expire before the end of this year. ""The Chinese Communist Party's decision to expel journalists from China and Hong Kong is yet another step toward depriving the Chinese people and the World of access to true information about China,"" the White House's National Security Council tweeted Tuesday in response to the decision. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HITS BACK AFTER CHINA KICKS OUT US JOURNALISTS AMID CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has also stepped into the fray. On Monday he called People’s Republic of China Politburo member Yang Jiechi to push back on a tweet from the deputy director-general for the Chinese Foreign Ministry's Information Department. The deputy director-general, Lijian Zhao, tweeted that the United States military might be responsible for the coronavirus. He provided no evidence to that effect. ""Secretary Pompeo conveyed strong U.S. objections to PRC efforts to shift blame for COVID-19 to the United States,"" State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said in a Monday statement. ""The secretary stressed that this is not the time to spread disinformation and outlandish rumors, but rather a time for all nations to come together to fight this common threat."" Trump also addressed the topic Wednesday: ""As you know China tried to say at one point, maybe they stopped now, that it was caused by American soldiers. That can't happen. it's not gonna happen. Not as long as I'm president. It comes from China."" This comes as a variety of American officials continue to tailor their language around the coronavirus to call it the ""Wuhan virus"" or ""Chinese coronavirus"" over the objections of China and American liberals who have said that calling the coronavirus anything that indicates it is from China or Wuhan, the city in China where the virus is from, is racist. That list includes Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Pompeo himself. POMPEO CONDEMNS CHINA'S 'EFFORTS TO SHIFT' CORONAVIRUS BLAME ON US IN CALL WITH COMMUNIST PARTY OFFICIAL Zhao, whose job is essentially to spread propaganda for China's oppressive regime – which has detained between one and five million Uighur Muslims in ""re-education"" camps that are essentially forced labor or concentration camps – has been sharing glowing stories of China's global response to the coronavirus despite the fact the nation's lack of transparency during its initial spread contributed to the seriousness of the pandemic. As early as last Wednesday Trump National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien was clearly assigning China with the responsibility for the coronavirus pandemic. ""Unfortunately, rather than using best practices, this outbreak in Wuhan was covered up,"" O'Brien said at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative-leaning think tank in Washington. ""There's lots of open-source reporting from China, from Chinese nationals, that the doctors involved were either silenced or put in isolation, or that sort of thing, so that the word of this virus could not get out. It probably cost the world community two months."" Zhao has also shared comments by Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Geng Shuang saying American efforts to move its medical supply chain back from the communist nation are ""unrealistic and unhelpful"" after China hinted at reducing its medical exports to the U.S., plunging America into ""the mighty sea of coronavirus."" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., has introduced a bill in the Senate aimed at doing just that. ""We’re looking at potential shortages of up to 150 commonly prescribed antibiotics and anti-viral medications,"" Hawley explained on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" last month. ""That’s bad. The problem is in whole or in part, these drugs are made in China.""

""It can do a lot of good things if we need it,"" he said at a White House press conference. ""We'll have it all completed, signing it in just a little while."" TRUMP INVOKES DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT: WHAT IS IT? The act ensures the private sector can ramp-up manufacturing and distribution of emergency medical supplies and equipment. The move gives the White House the authority to increase production of masks, ventilators and respirators, as well as expand hospital capacity to combat the coronavirus. Asked if he saw the nation as being on a wartime footing he said he did and described himself as ""in a sense a wartime president."" He made the remarks at a press conference along members of the coronavirus pandemic task force. The U.S. has largely shuttered many aspects of daily life in order to stem the rapid onset of the virus, echoing efforts across the globe. As of Wednesday morning, there were 6,519 cases and 114 deaths in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that coronavirus deaths in the U.S. mirror what has been reported in other countries, with approximately 4 out of 5 deaths occurring in people 65 and older — and no deaths in children. TRUMP SAYS HUD WILL SUSPEND 'ALL FORECLOSURES AND EVICTIONS' AMID COVID-19 OUTBREAK The crisis has caused chaos in the markets and the economy as a whole. Schools have closed and restaurants and bars have been reduced to takeout and delivery in many parts of the country. San Francisco declared a shelter-in-place order this week, while many states have put restrictions on large gatherings. The administration has been working with Congress on a nearly $1 trillion stimulus package to reinvigorate the U.S. economy and to provide relief to businesses and workers who have been hit hardest by the crisis. On Wednesday, Trump also announced that the Housing Department is suspending all foreclosures and evictions until the end of April. Earlier in the day he had announced that the U.S. and Canada had agreed to temporarily close their shared border to non-essential traffic. Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the taskforce, announced that Health and Human Services are suspending a regulation that prevents medical professionals from practicing medicine across state lines.

"                          Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says the economy is slowing to a standstill as COVID-19 spreads. Green New Deal activists released their long list of priorities for a coronavirus economic relief, pitching a $2,000 a month payment to Americans and a break from bills during the crisis. The former chief of staff to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted out the list of federal actions progressives will push for as Washington is moving swiftly on the third round of legislation to respond to the global pandemic. Comparing the federal response needed to Great Depression and World War II mobilizations, the activists want to suspend the rule requiring Treasury to issue new debt for financing to create ""debt-free money"" and demand the Fed open its discount window lending immediately to small businesses. They've called for dropping ""helicopter money"" into taxpayers' bank, Venmo or PayPal accounts. The ask list, authored by the New Consensus activists behind the Green New Deal, also calls for direct support for small businesses, investment in building stockpiles of medical goods, foods and fuels, temporary suspension of certain tariffs and other trade impediments. AOC RIPS CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL AS 'COMPLETELY INSUFFICIENT,' CALLS FOR CASH INFUSIONS, REIMBURSING STUDENTS But perhaps the most immediate relief to workers would be $1,000 biweekly payments for at least six months. The current proposals of $1,000 per month don't go far enough, they argue, and at least $2,000 monthly is needed for everyone. Consumers should also get a break from all their debt payments for six months, including credit card debt, student debt, mortgage and lease payments. There should also be a nationwide moratorium on mortgage foreclosures, the activists said. The progressive groups are aligned with Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Some of the ideas have already gotten support from the politicians in a position to vote on such measures and influence policy. Sanders backed the $ 2,000-a-month proposal Tuesday night as he suffered another round of election losses in his bid for the White House. CORONAVIRUS CASES TOP 200,000 WORLDWIDE, DEATH TOLL PASSES 8,000 ""We need to provide a direct emergency $2,000 cash payment to every household in American every month for the duration of the crisis,"" Sanders said. He also backed a hold on student loan payments, a moratorium on evictions and foreclosures, and expanding the eligibility for unemployment benefits to gig workers and freelancers and upping the maximum benefit checks to $75,000 a year. For her part, Ocasio-Cortez has also pitched big bold ideas, saying the response so far has been ""completely insufficient."" She's also pushing direct cash payments, suspending all rent, mortgage and debt payments, expanded unemployment insurance and universal health care. ""What people are dealing with is a liquidity issue,"" Ocasio-Cortez told 1010 WINS on Wednesday. ""While cutting checks is an important part of an equation, I don't think it's going to help if it's the only action that taken. We need to take a look at mortgage, rent and student loan payment suspension to give people that buffer time."" Ocasio-Cortez wants priority on public transit funds over airline relief and has pushed for free subway rides. She's blasted the airlines for using their profits to buy up stock rather than raising wages or making other investments. She's demanded a ban on stock buybacks if any federal bailout happens for corporate industries. ""I personally think that it's much more worthwhile for us to bail out our public transportation than the airline industry,"" Ocasio-Cortez told the radio station. ""...That investment in public infrastructure hasn't happened. I support federal funds to MTA  (Metropolitan Transportation Authority) and I personally would like to see the MTA be free or extraordinarily reduced."" Some Republicans, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Sen. Mitt Romney, have backed direct cash payments. The administration is pushing a massive stimulus package that includes two rounds of payments worth $500 billion total. But progressives are leery the GOP plan doesn't go far enough in terms of the length of payments, amount of money and scope of eligibility. Meanwhile, Sen. Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the Senate, is pushing his own $750 billion stimulus that boosts public health capacity, expands unemployment benefits, provides low-interest loans to small businesses, cancels student loan payments and gives priority to workers in any targeted bailout of industries. It doesn't include direct payments to Americans.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) offices across the country will close as part of the effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus, the agency announced Wednesday. “Effective March 18, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is suspending in-person services at its field offices, asylum offices and Application Support Centers (ASCs) to help slow the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),” the agency said in a statement. IMMIGRANTS SEEKING NATURALIZATION WON'T BE PUNISHED IF THEY TEST FOR CORONAVIRUS, USCIS ANNOUNCES It said the suspension of services will last until at least April 1, although it will still process emergency requests. But asylum applications, naturalization ceremonies and other services will be postponed. The agency, which is the core agency dealing with most forms of legal immigration and asylum cases in the U.S., will send notices to immigrants and applicants affected by the delay, and interviews will be rescheduled, the statement said.

"                          Identifying the disease in patients has become the biggest challenge for health care providers; correspondent Laura Ingle reports from Oceanside, N.Y. Roughly half of Americans believe it will take at least a year before a vaccine for the coronavirus strain that causes COVID-19 becomes available, according to a new national poll. That timetable is in line with what most public health experts have said. But according to the new national poll by the Pew Research Center, about one fifth think a vaccine could be ready for mass consumption in just a few months. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW The survey – which was released on Wednesday – points to a partisan divide on when a vaccine would become available. Nearly three in 10 Republicans questioned said they thought it would just be a few months before a vaccine comes online. Only 17 percent of Democrats were optimistic about a speedy vaccine. There have been claims by some – including President Trump – about a quicker timetable for a vaccine. The president may have confused some Americans earlier this month when he appeared to blur the line between when vaccine trial testing would begin and when vaccines would be ready for widespread public use. There’s also a partisan divide over the origins of the virus.  Overall, the poll shows just over four in 10 Americans answered that the virus likely came about naturally. But about a quarter questioned said that it was intentionally developed in a lab. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK  Thirty percent of Republicans and independents who lean Republican said the coronavirus was intentionally created in a lab – compared with only 16 percent of Democrats and independents who lean toward the Democratic Party. Much of this misinformation may be coming from social media. Nearly half of those questioned said they’ve seen at least some made-up news about the pandemic. But seven in 10 said the news media are doing at least a somewhat good job in reporting on the outbreak. The poll, which was conducted March 10-16, also showed that nine in 10 Americans were closely paying attention to news reports about coronavirus and that seven in 10 said the outbreak poses a major threat to the nation’s economy.

"                          Coronavirus fears are hammering the U.S. airline industry, leading to a reduction in flights and the waiving of ticket change fees; William La Jeunesse has the details. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., issued a stark warning to any multinational companies looking to Congress to help them weather the economic downturn from the coronavirus outbreak: If you want taxpayer money, bring jobs back to the United States. Hawley delivered his warning via Twitter on Wednesday as the Trump administration pursues a $1 trillion stimulus package to aid Americans and an economy devastated by business closures and event cancellations and a concerted push for people to stay inside in the effort to curb infection rates. “To any multinational corporations that come to Congress asking for taxpayer $$$, you better come prepared to explain how you will move supply chains and jobs back to America if you want my vote,” Hawley tweeted.  The White House proposal includes $50 billion for lending to the airline industry, which has drastically reduced flights due to travel bans and social distancing. The proposal also calls for $150 billion to ""other severely distressed sectors of the U.S. economy"" through secured lending or loan guarantees, with Trump signaling that the hotel and cruise line industries along with airlines are “prime candidates” to receive the aid.  While an aid package to the airlines would be contingent on ""limits on increases in executive pay"" until the loans are repaid, many Americans want to see more radical changes to an industry critics say puts profit over travelers’ safety and comfort. “We cannot permit American and other airlines to use federal assistance, whether labeled a bailout or not, to weather the coronavirus crisis and then return to business as usual,” Tim Wu, a law professor at Columbia University, wrote in The New York Times. “Before providing any loan relief, tax breaks or cash transfers, we must demand that the airlines change how they treat their customers and employees and make basic changes in industry ownership structure.” Along with the money for major companies, the administration is also seeking $250 billion in payments to Americans starting April 6, followed by another $250 billion cash-payment round beginning May 18. The two payments to taxpayers would be identical and the amounts would vary by family income and size. Trump also wants $300 billion to help small businesses, which have suffered under social isolation and various cities banning dine-in services at bars and restaurants in an effort to prevent the spread. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE The draft of the plan outlines a major economic infusion that goes well beyond the stimulus and bailout plans during the last financial crisis and is designed to prop up an economy that has ground to a halt, as stores and restaurants and schools are shuttering nationwide and families are isolating at home. Congress and President Trump already approved an $8.3 billion package to prop up the health care system to respond to the pandemic. The Senate Wednesday was poised to send another bill to Trump's desk to give 14 paid sick days to workers, boost unemployment insurance, make coronavirus testing free and increase food assistance during the crisis. But all sides agree that the government must pass a third round of stimulus as soon as possible to help small businesses stay afloat, aid workers who have lost jobs and give the economy a jolt as American consumers nationwide are stuck home.

US NAVY HOSPITAL SHIPS TO BE DISPATCHED TO NYC 'IMMEDIATELY' AMID COVID-19 OUTBREAK, CUOMO SAYS “We think part of this is people heeded the early data coming out of China and coming out of South Korea that the elderly or those with preexisting medical conditions were at particular risk,” Birx said. “It may have been that the millennial generation, our largest generation, our future generation that will carry us through for the next multiple decades, there may be disproportional infections among that group.” She added: “So, even if it is a rare occurrence, it may be seen more frequently in that group and be evident now.” Birx went on to say that they have not yet seen “any significant mortality in children,” but said they are becoming increasingly “concerned about reports coming out of Italy and France.” “We need [millennials] to be healthy,” she continued. “I’m not only calling on you to heed what’s in the guidance, but to make sure that each and every one of you are protecting each other.” Birx added that millennials “cannot keep having these large gatherings that continue to occur throughout the country for people who are off work to then be socializing in large groups and spreading the virus.” “You have the potential, then, to spread it to someone who does have a condition that none of us knew about and cause them to have a disastrous outcome,” Birx said. Birx’s warnings came after multiple reports that Italy and France were seeing an influx of younger individuals falling seriously ill due to the COVID-19 infection. DR. FAUCI JOINS BARSTOOL SPORTS' 'PARDON MY TAKE' TO WARN YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT CORONAVIRUS Earlier Wednesday, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who is also on the White House coronavirus task force, joined Barstool Sports’ popular “Pardon My Take” sports podcast, to explain how young people “need to protect” the vulnerable. “The younger individuals, people who are the millennials, people who are otherwise young and healthy, generally, with some exceptions, you’re not completely exempt from risk,” Fauci said on the podcast Wednesday. “The problem is, we need the young people to help us to protect the vulnerable because, when an individual who is young gets infected, and either has no symptoms at all, or even mild symptoms, that individual will continue the virus spreading in the community,” Fauci said. “You might inadvertently, even though you feel that you are invulnerable… even if you are doing very well, you have to be a very important part of our national effort to contain the outbreak."" Fauci said young people are not “passive” when it comes to slowing down coronavirus. “You are an important part of the active plan to contain this epidemic,” Fauci said. “We really do need you, this isn’t something that can be successful without you.” Meanwhile, Birx also warned Americans that new studies are revealing that the novel coronavirus could be transmitted via “hard surfaces,” as well as human to human, and even fabric transmission and reminded that staying home is the best prevention. “This is all new science,” she said. As of mid-day Wednesday, the U.S. currently had more than 7,300 confirmed cases of coronavirus in all 50 states, including Washington, D.C. The U.S., so far, has seen 115 COVID-19-related deaths. The Trump administration’s coronavirus task force predicted Tuesday that the number of cases in the U.S. could peak in about 45 days. Fox News' Brian Flood contributed to this report.

This comes as the Trump administration is pitching a roughly $1 trillion stimulus plan.

"                          Fox News Decision Desk projects that former Vice President Joe Biden will decisively beat Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders in the delegate-rich states of Florida and Illinois. **Want FOX News Halftime Report in your inbox every day? Sign up here.**On the roster: A nominee all but certain, Dems still face deep doubts - Trump invokes Cold War powers to battle virus - One of the last pro-life Dems falls in primary - Humanity check    A NOMINEE ALL BUT CERTAIN, DEMS STILL FACE DEEP DOUBTS WaPo: “The Democratic presidential race passed a point of no return Tuesday, with former vice president Joe Biden firmly in control of his party’s nomination over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). But politics more broadly entered into the unknown as the spreading coronavirus continued to radically disrupt the political life of the country. This combination of certainty and uncertainty was highlighted on a day when three states — Arizona, Florida and Illinois — held primaries and another — Ohio — that was scheduled to do so abruptly shut down its polling places for reasons of health safety. Nothing better described a new normal than the rapidly changing face of American politics in the age of a pandemic. … The final primaries now could come only weeks before the Democratic National Convention is scheduled to convene in Milwaukee — if it is held as planned. Squabbles among state and local officials, some partisan and some territorial, highlighted the tensions facing all government leaders as they attempt to preserve the sacred process of voting amid fears that the traditional methods of casting ballots now endanger voters and poll workers alike.”Tuesday voter turnout maintained by early, mail voting - FiveThirtyEight: “The turnout drop may have been especially stark in Illinois because it is more reliant on in-person voting than Florida is. Indeed, both states saw an increase in the number of early or mail votes but a decrease in the number of in-person Election Day votes… Meanwhile, in Florida, 658,234 Democrats had returned their mail ballots as of Tuesday morning — already an increase of 27 percent from 2016. And 438,949 Florida Democrats voted early, which was up 19 percent from 2016. However, it looks like Democrats cast only about 500,000 votes on Election Day itself, which would be down 40 percent from 2016. Basically, the data from yesterday’s elections suggests that, in the face of the coronavirus threat, many voters simply traded voting in person for voting early or by mail. As long as the pandemic lingers, this could become a new normal for elections.”Time is on Sanders’ side - NYT: “The breadth of Mr. Biden’s advantage denies Mr. Sanders any realistic opportunity for a comeback. Perhaps Mr. Sanders will win a party-run primary or caucus… [But] without victories, Mr. Sanders will be deprived of opportunities to claim the momentum and favorable news coverage to change the trajectory of the race. … The likelihood of any potential game-changing event becomes likelier with time. By this measure, the new delays in the Democratic primary schedule as a result of the coronavirus slightly widen whatever narrow path might still exist for Mr. Sanders. He would have faced an even greater deficit if Ohio had voted on Tuesday as originally scheduled, based on results so far. … And Mr. Biden might have won an outright majority of delegates and wrapped up the nomination by late April. Now it is hard to say when he will clinch it.”DNC warns of delegate penalty to states delaying primaries past June 9 - The Guardian: “A new memo from the Democratic National Committee panel that handles delegate selection for the presidential nomination warns that states that hastily change the ‘first determining step’ of their own process could be subject to penalties – including a 50% reduction in delegates – if they hold primaries after a June cut-off date. The memo also says the panel is looking at ways to adjust how delegates are selected in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Three states will hold primaries on Tuesday. A fourth, Ohio, postponed its vote on Monday, due to Covid-19 and its drastic effect on public life. Louisiana, Kentucky, Georgia and Maryland have also postponed their votes. As in virtually every part of US society, election officials at every level have been discussing ways to safely administer elections without spreading the coronavirus. The new DNC memo, obtained by the Guardian, was sent to members of the rules and bylaws committee on Wednesday night.”Looking ahead to Georgia primary - AJC: “Joe Biden was poised for a big victory over Bernie Sanders in Georgia before the state’s presidential preference primary was postponed two months, according to an Atlanta Journal-Constitution survey released Tuesday that gave the former vice president a 44-point lead over his chief Democratic adversary. The former vice president led Sanders 66% to 22% in the poll released Tuesday, which showed only 11% of Georgia Democratic voters were undecided. The vote was delayed from March 24 to May 19 because of growing concerns about the coronavirus pandemic.”THE RULEBOOK: BY THE PEOPLE, OF THE PEOPLE“It is ESSENTIAL to such a government that it be derived from the great body of the society, not from an inconsiderable proportion, or a favored class of it; otherwise a handful of tyrannical nobles, exercising their oppressions by a delegation of their powers, might aspire to the rank of republicans, and claim for their government the honorable title of republic.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 39TIME OUT: PLAY (POK-TA-POK) BALLSmithsonian: “The ball game pok-ta-pok was nearly ubiquitous in pre-Hispanic Mesoamerica, but today, its origins remain a matter of debate among archaeologists. Though a version of the activity appears in the Maya creation myth, many modern researchers suspect it actually originated near the Gulf Coast. Now, however, a newly discovered pok-ta-pok court nestled in the highlands of Oaxaca, Mexico, is challenging that theory. The court, found at the Etlatongo archaeological site, dates to between 1400 and 1300 B.C., according to research published in the journal Science Advances. In use for about 175 years, the space is the second-oldest Mesoamerican ball court found to date—the oldest is located in Paso de la Amada and was built around 1650 B.C., reports Science magazine’s Lizzie Wade. The Etlatongo court dates to a pivotal period in the region’s history, when political and religious factions, trade, and a clear social hierarchy were starting to emerge.”Flag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARDESTIMATED DELEGATES FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATIONBiden: 1165Sanders: 880[Ed. note: 1,991 delegates needed to win]TRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE Average approval: 43.8 percentAverage disapproval: 51.8 percentNet Score: -8 percentChange from one week ago: ↑ 0.4 points[Average includes: NPR/PBS News/Marist: 43% approve - 50% disapprove; NBC News/WSJ: 46% approve - 51% disapprove; Gallup: 44% approve - 52% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 41% approve - 54% disapprove; CNN: 45% approve - 52% disapprove.]WANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT? You can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

The move gives the White House the authority to increase production of masks, ventilators and respirators, as well as expand hospital capacity to combat the coronavirus. He made the announcement at a press conference along members of the coronavirus pandemic task force. The U.S. has largely shuttered many aspects of daily life in order to stem the rapid onset of the virus, echoing efforts across the globe. As of Wednesday morning, there were 6,519 cases and 114 deaths in the United States.”Despite ‘shortcomings,’ Senate to pass coronavirus package - Politico: “The Senate is expected to pass a multi-billion dollar emergency aid package on Wednesday to confront the economic impacts of the coronavirus, as the Treasury Department calls for $250 billion in direct payments to Americans starting April 6. The Senate’s approval of the House-passed coronavirus bill paves the way for negotiations on a third, even larger stimulus package to address the pandemic. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reiterated his support Wednesday for the House package and vowed to address any ‘imperfections’ in the Senate’s subsequent bill — which McConnell promised to craft at ‘warp speed.’ … Despite ‘real shortcomings’ in the legislation, McConnell said, ‘in this case I do not believe we should let perfection be the enemy of something that will help even a subset of workers.’”Treasury lays out plan for cash pump - AP: “The Treasury Department said Wednesday it wants to start issuing direct payments to Americans by early next month as the centerpiece of a $1 trillion plan to stabilize the economy as the coronavirus epidemic threatens a body slam to taxpayers and businesses. In a memorandum, Treasury proposed two $250 billion cash infusions to individuals: A first set of checks issued starting April 6, with a second wave in mid-May. The amounts would depend on income and family size. The Treasury plan, which requires approval by Congress, also recommends $50 billion to stabilize the airlines, $150 billion to issue loan guarantees to other struggling sectors, and $300 billion to for small businesses. The plan appears to anticipate that some of the loans would not be repaid.”Dem super PAC to hit Trump over coronavirus response - WaPo: “A Democratic super PAC said Tuesday it would spend $5 million on digital advertising flaying President Trump for his response to the novel coronavirus, one of several groups that planned to devote resources to this type of messaging. The campaign from Pacronym — a political action committee affiliated with the nonprofit group Acronym — represents the first major pivot to coronavirus-related advertising fewer than 250 days from the election. It is a bet that the pandemic, which is also causing a deep economic downturn, will be the defining issue of the campaign. ‘This is a public health issue and a national security issue, but it’s also a public policy issue and thus a political one,’ said Tara McGowan, the founder and chief executive of Acronym, whose board includes veteran Democratic operatives like David Plouffe, who managed Barack Obama’s 2008 bid.”Trump unapologetically uses phrase ‘Chinese Virus’ - Fox News: “The war of words between the Trump administration and China over the origin of coronavirus has escalated as President Trump is going out of his way to call it the ‘Chinese Virus’ and China has embarked on a propaganda campaign to shift blame for the pandemic away from the Chinese Communist Party's handling of the crisis. The escalation comes as the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread in the United States, shutting down sporting events, restaurants, bars and elections across the country. ‘I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously,’ Trump tweeted Wednesday morning, commenting on news coverage about his response to the pandemic -- one of three Wednesday morning tweets referencing the ‘Chinese Virus.’ Minutes earlier he tweeted: ‘I will be having a news conference today to discuss very important news from the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] concerning the Chinese Virus!’”Trump has changed his tone on the virus - Politico: “President Donald Trump on Tuesday insisted that he had never underestimated or underappreciated the seriousness of coronavirus. But for two months he and some members of his administration downplayed the global threat even as world events and government and outside experts made clear that the health and economic impacts of this disease would be dire. Here are just some of those comments…”Yang isn’t pleased about the use of his signature issue - Politico: “Andrew Yang takes no pleasure in looking prophetical. The tech entrepreneur and former candidate for president, who last month suspended his campaign after poor showings in Iowa and New Hampshire, built his candidacy around the idea of universal basic income — that Americans should receive $1,000 each month from the government. The proposal was not so much panned as it was ignored… In response to the economic threat posed by the spread of COVID-19 … the Trump administration on Tuesday announced its intention to mail checks to Americans as quickly as possible. … ‘My phone is blowing up,’ [Yang] tweeted shortly after the White House briefing, an observation that has won 56,000 likes and counting. For all the congratulatory notes, however, Yang is deeply unsettled about the current crisis, no matter the role it might play in advancing his signature issue.”ONE OF THE LAST PRO-LIFE DEMS FALLS IN PRIMARY Reuters: “Liberal Democrat Marie Newman beat incumbent Dan Lipinski in a U.S. House of Representatives primary race in Illinois on Tuesday, according to news reports. It was a rematch for Lipinski, a long-time congressman, and Newman, a progressive businesswoman, who first faced off for the Chicago-area seat in a 2018 primary that Lipinski narrowly won. Lipinski, a member and past co-chair of the moderate ‘Blue Dog’ coalition who has served in the U.S. Congress since 2004, has been criticized by abortion rights and gay rights groups for his socially conservative views and faced blowback for voting against former Democratic President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act.

That means we have about 60 days of supply from the year before the day we start harvest to the next. Or clearer stated about 60 days’ supply till we run out of food. This includes all meats, dairy and plant-based proteins.  Like other essentials, because of the efficacy of the system, we have become complacent against events like Covid-19. One solution is to create a Strategic Food Reserve. We could take the next 10 years to build storage and supplies. This would solve two issues, 1) We can withstand future events with less disruptions. 2) Bolster the farm economy due to a demand market instead of supply.” – Jim Hain, Omaha, Neb.[Ed. note: I had never even thought about such a thing, Mr. Hain. I imagine there would be a lot of questions, as there were with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, about how much of what would go in how often. But given the likelihood of future supply chain disruptions, you may be on to something. Thank you for sharing it.]“In 2010 approximately 12,400 people died from the Swine flu in the US. No sports, restaurants, or other venues were shut down. We have about 100 deaths in the US from the coronavirus to date. Why is the coronavirus being treated so differently and why is there such panic? Does this mean in about two years when we have another new virus we’re going to have fear and panic and ruined economy all over again?” – Mike Wiater, Colorado Springs, Colo.[Ed. note: You are not alone in your resentment toward the scale of the response in this case, Mr. Wiater. Lots of Americans, including, until recently, the president, thought to minimize the dangers of the current crisis. But I urge you to read up on this subject and understand the unique threats this virus poses to Americans’ health and our way of life. The CDC’s resource page is very useful and will help you through the process. The rate of contagion and potential mortality rate here is quite concerning. Precautions that you take now will save lives, potentially including among friends, neighbors and loved ones. Now is the time for Americans to put their shoulders into this.]“What’s the point of ‘calling’ an electoral race unless it’s winner take all? Isn’t it all about the delegates?” – Chris Sales, Christchurch, New Zealand[Ed. note: Back when North Americans were still playing ice hockey, the NHL’s rules state that both teams in an overtime game get 1 point in the standings, while the winning team gets a total of 2 points. This may be a little like that. It’s true that Bernie Sanders won delegates in all three states that voted on Tuesday, but it’s also true that he did not win any of the states. When we project a winner before most of the votes have been counted it is a reflection, usually, of a decisive victory. Especially from a psychological and momentum stand point, that counts for a lot.]Share your color commentary: Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM and please make sure to include your name and hometown.HUMANITY CHECK UPI: “An anonymous customer at a Houston restaurant left staff a $9,400 tip just hours after the county announced mandatory business closings.

"                          President Trump announces developments on the war against the 'Chinese virus' including human trials for a vaccine are now underway The White House is moving forward with a proposed $1 trillion coronavirus package that would infuse Americans' bank accounts with two rounds of direct cash payments. The Trump administration is seeking $250 billion in payments to Americans starting April 6, followed by another $250 billion cash payment round beginning May 18, according to the working draft of the plan obtained by Fox Business Network. The two payments to taxpayers would be identical and the amounts would vary by family income and size, according to the Treasury Department document on the ""Stage Three"" coronavirus proposal. The Washington Post first reported the document. AOC AND ALLIED PROGRESSIVES SEEK MONTHLY CASH PAYMENTS, RENT 'SUSPENSION' IN CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE The draft of the plan outlines a major economic infusion that goes well beyond the stimulus and bailout plans during the last financial crisis and designed to prop up an economy that has ground to a halt as stores and restaurants and schools are shuttering nationwide and families are isolating at home. The Trump administration’s stimulus package is bigger than the 2008 bank bailout, and the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which was passed and signed under former President Barack Obama and totaled $787 billion to help stabilize the economy about 14 months after the last recession began. Congress and President Trump already approved an $8.3 billion package to prop up the health care system to respond to the pandemic. The Senate Wednesday is poised to send another bill to Trump's desk to give 14 paid sick days to workers, boost unemployment insurance, make coronavirus testing free and increase food assistance during the crisis. But all sides agree that the government must pass a third round of stimulus as soon as possible to help small businesses stay afloat, aid workers who have lost jobs and give the economy a jolt as American consumers nationwide are stuck home. TRUMP CALLS HIMSELF A ‘WARTIME PRESIDENT’ OVER CORONAVIRUS AS HE INVOKES DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT The administration's working plan amounts to $1 trillion on paper. It would provide $50 billion for lending to the airline industry, which has drastically reduced flights due to travel bans and social distancing. The proposal would require ""limits on increases in executive pay"" until the loans are repaid. The proposal calls for $150 billion to ""other severely distressed sectors of the U.S. economy"" through secured lending or loan guarantees. Trump signaled Wednesday that airlines, cruise ships and hotel industries are all ""prime candidates"" for support. The Trump administration also wants $300 billion to help small businesses, which have suffered under social isolation and various cities banning dine-in services at bars and restaurants in an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The administration would create a ""small business interruption loan program"" targeted at businesses with fewer than 500 employees that would cover six weeks of payroll. The amount for each employee's wages would be capped at $1,540 per week, or about $80,000 a year.

"                          President Trump announced he will invoke the Defense Production Act, which aims to better prepare the U.S. for the manufacturing and distribution of medical supplies amid coronavirus. President Trump announced on Wednesday that he will be invoking the Defense Production Act in an effort to help the private sector ramp-up manufacturing and distribution of emergency medical supplies and equipment amid the coronavirus pandemic. The act, which was first enacted in 1950 as a response to the Korean War and has since been re-invoked more than 50 times since, will streamline production of medical supplies to help the country battle the coronavirus pandemic and require businesses to sign contracts or fulfill orders deemed necessary for national defense. TRUMP ANNOUNCES HE IS INVOKING DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT TO FIGHT CORONAVIRUS “If we need to use it we’ll be using it,” Trump said. “It’s full speed ahead.” The act was periodically used during both the Korean War and throughout the Cold War, and was last invoked in June 2017 by Trump to provide technology in the space industrial base. Trump was not specific on the details of what the act would be used for – besides mentioning ventilators and masks – but below is a look at what the three main sections of the Defense Production Act: CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Along with the three main provisions, the act also provides the government with the authority to obtain information from businesses, authorizes establishment of the National Defense Executive Reserve, and a Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States – which works on the effects on national security of certain mergers, acquisitions, and takeovers related to foreign investment in the U.S. When the act is invoked it requires the administration to file an annual report to Congress on the impact of offsets on the defense preparedness, industrial competitiveness, employment, and trade from the act.

"                          Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tells Fox News that a plan will be done soon; Gillian Turner reports from the White House. President Trump on Wednesday announced that the Department of Housing and Urban Development will suspend all home foreclosures and evictions to the end of April amid the coronavirus outbreak. During a press conference from the White House briefing room on Wednesday, Trump said that he was working with HUD Secretary Ben Carson on the matter. SCHUMER SAYS US 'ALMOST CERTAINTLY' WILL SEE A RECESSION DUE TO CORONAVIRUS “HUD will suspend all foreclosures and evictions until the end of April,” Trump said. The announcement comes as the coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, outbreak rocks the markets and the economy. The president has said that a recession is possible, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., echoed the same concerns from the Senate floor Wednesday. “Even as the market shifts from day to day, coronavirus is slowing our economy to a near standstill and we’re almost certainly anticipating a recession,” Schumer said. On Wednesday, in the opening minutes of trading, U.S. equity markets plunged, removing all gains from earlier in the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,268 points, or 5.9 percent, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were lower by 5.4 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively. Trading is halted if the S&P 500 falls by 7 percent. The instability in the markets came as the Trump administration was negotiating with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to hammer out the details of a stimulus package that could reach $1 trillion to help U.S. businesses and taxpayers deal with the economic fallout. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, opening the Senate on Tuesday morning, promised swift action, though there is no clear timeline on when the Senate will vote on the package. ""The Senate will not adjourn until we have passed significant and bold new steps above and beyond what the House has passed to help our strong nation and our strong underlying economy weather this storm,"" McConnell said. TRUMP TELLS PEOPLE OUT OF WORK DUE TO CORONAVIRUS THAT MONEY WILL 'SOON BE COMING TO YOU' The Trump administration’s stimulus package is bigger than the 2008 bank bailout, and the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which was passed and signed under former President Barack Obama, and totaled $787 billion to help stabilize the economy about 14 months after the last recession began. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday that Trump wants him to send checks to Americans within “the next two weeks” in an effort to help people cope with the economic fallout due to the COVID-19 spread. Trump, on Wednesday, in an attempt to calm the thousands of Americans who have already applied for unemployment or have been furloughed due to the spread of the virus, said that “money will soon be coming to you.” “For the people that are now out of work because of the important and necessary containment policies, for instance the shutting down of hotels, bars and restaurants, money will soon be coming to you,” he tweeted Wednesday. The World Health Organization designated COVID-19 a global pandemic last week. As of Wednesday morning, there were more than 6,500 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States, in all 50 states, including Washington, D.C. The U.S., so far, has seen 115 coronavirus-related deaths.

"                          Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders addresses the changes being made to his campaign during the outbreak. As Sen. Bernie Sanders mulls whether to pull the plug on his White House bid, his presidential campaign on Wednesday paused investing any new money in Facebook ads. The move comes the morning after the progressive firebrand from Vermont was swept in Tuesday’s three Democratic presidential nomination primaries by Joe Biden. The former vice president’s overwhelming victory in Florida, his nearly 25-percentage-point defeat of Sanders in Illinois and his win in Arizona cemented his status as the presumptive Democratic nominee and all but shut the door to Sanders’ extremely narrow pathway to winning the nomination. SANDERS MULLS PULLING PLUG ON PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN  The pause in Facebook ads raised eyebrows – as former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg each stopped running Facebook ads in the hours before they ended their presidential runs. The news – first reported by Axios – sparked some incorrect rumors on Twitter that Sanders was suspending his campaign. Sanders communications director Mike Casca took to Twitter and put out an email statement to clear the record. “Good afternoon, everyone. The tweet about an Axios 'report' is wrong. He's not suspending. Nothing has changed since this morning's statement. Thanks,” Casca wrote in his email to reporters. At the Capitol, Sanders also personally denied he was dropping out. “There's not going to be an election for another three weeks. We are talking to our supporters. Anybody who suggests at this point we're ending our campaign is not telling the truth,” he told Fox News' Sally Persons. Earlier Wednesday, Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir explained in a statement to reporters: “The next primary contest is at least three weeks away. Sen. Sanders is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign.” In a subsequent email to supporters, Shakir acknowledged there’s “No sugarcoating it, last night did not go the way we wanted.”    ",         Sanders pauses Facebook ads as he weighs ending presidential campaign,         2020-03-18T123808-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/sanders-takes-pause-in-facebook-ads-as-he-weighs-ending-presidential-campaign,Fox
"                          West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin weighs in on coronavirus aid package and outbreak response. The Senate on Wednesday passed the House's coronavirus legislation to provide sick leave, unemployment help and free testing to Americans, sending the second COVID-19 relief bill to President Trump. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had criticized the legislation negotiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin as having ""real shortcomings"", but urged his members to ""gag and vote for it anyway"" to show bipartisan cooperation during the global pandemic. ""This is a time for urgent bipartisan action, and in this case, I do not believe we should let perfection be the enemy of something that will help even a subset of workers,"" McConnell said Wednesday morning in announcing he'd vote for the House legislation. The Senate passed the legislation in a 90-8 vote. The legislation that Trump is expected to sign into law would provide 14 days of paid sick days to workers affected by the coronavirus, ensure free testing to everyone, including the uninsured, and expand food aid and unemployment dollars to states. WHAT'S IN THE CORONAVIRUS BILL BEFORE CONGRESS Next up, the Senate and White House have been moving quickly to draft a third round of stimulus legislation that could infuse about $1 trillion into the U.S. economy that has been rattled by school closures, business shutdowns and steep declines in the travel and tourism industry as many Americans are stuck home. McConnell signaled Wednesday that Senate Republicans were close to an agreement on the next round of legislation that would help businesses, American workers, health-care professionals and others hard hit by the public health emergency. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SEEKS 2 ROUNDS OF CHECKS TO AMERICANS IN MASSIVE CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE ""Yeah, we’re working along and hoping to be together shortly,"" McConnell told reporters when asked whether Republicans were close on legislation. The House and Senate already passed a bipartisan $8.3 billion package to prop up the health-care system to prepare for the influx of sick Americans. The second response bill that passed Wednesday aims to bring relief to workers who lost their jobs and families at home for illnesses, quarantines or caring for kids whose schools have shuttered. Trump backed the plan that passed the House early Saturday morning with broad bipartisan support in a 363-40 vote. The legislation moved so hastily, bypassing the normal review processes, that the House had to make corrections to the bill language Monday. Earlier Wednesday, the Senate defeated amendments to the House legislation that were offered by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and a third by Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. Now, all eyes turn to the third round of stimulus that could infuse Americans' bank accounts with direct cash payments, an idea pushed by the far left and the White House. The Trump administration has been seeking $250 billion in payments to Americans starting April 6, followed by another $250 billion cash payment round beginning May 18, according to the working draft of the plan obtained by Fox Business. The two payments to taxpayers would be identical and the amounts would vary by family income and size, according to the Treasury Department document on the ""Stage Three"" coronavirus proposal. The Trump proposal would provide $50 billion for lending to the airline industry and another $150 billion to ""other severely distressed sectors of the U.S. economy"" through secured lending or loan guarantees. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Trump administration also signaled it wanted $300 billion to help small businesses, which have suffered under social isolation and various cities banning dine-in services at bars and restaurants in an effort to prevent the spread of the COVID-19.

"                          Former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld says he offers GOP voters a real economic conservative for president. Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld – the sole remaining GOP primary challenger against President Trump – ended his White House bid on Wednesday. The move by Weld to drop out of the race came the day after president formally clinched the nomination, as Trump topped the 1,276 delegates needed to be the Republican presidential standard-bearer once more. TRUMP SECURES 2020 GOP NOMINATION WITH PRIMARY VICTORIES “I hereby announce that I am suspending my candidacy for President of the United States, effective immediately,” Weld wrote in a statement obtained by Fox News. “I am immensely grateful to all the patriotic women and men who have stood with me during the past eleven months in our effort to bring better government to Washington, D.C.”       Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld - a 2020 GOP presidential primary challenger - files to place his name on New Hampshire's primary ballot - in Concord, NH in Nov. 2019.       Weld – a former two-term Republican governor who served at the Libertarian Party’s vice presidential nominee in 2016 – was a longtime vocal Trump critic.  In February of last year, as he took the first step towards launching a long-shot primary challenge against the president, Weld warned that “our country is in grave peril and I cannot sit quietly on the sidelines anymore.” And he slammed Trump, claiming “we have a president whose priorities are skewed toward promoting of himself rather than toward the good of the country.” Weld formally announced his candidacy in April and spent much of his time on the campaign trail in New Hampshire – which neighbors his home state and holds the first primary in the presidential calendar. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN With Trump extremely popular among Republicans, Weld repeatedly told Fox News and other news organizations that his plan to stay competitive would be to attract independent voters and even some Democrats to oppose Trump on the GOP presidential ballot. Bu the vast majority of independents opted to vote in the Democratic presidential primaries – where all the action was – leaving Weld with no shot of making a dent in the president’s renomination. Weld’s best primary finish was in the March 3 Vermont contest where he won 10 percent of the vote. He grabbed 9 percent in New Hampshire’s primary and in his home state, far below where he had hoped to finish. And while Trump’s captured 1,330 delegates to date, Weld only won one – in Iowa’s caucuses. Weld was joined in the GOP primary battle by former South Carolina governor and congressman Mark Sanford and by former Rep. Joe Walsh of Illinois, a conservative radio talk show host. Sanford ended his bid last autumn and Walsh dropped out after the Iowa caucuses. Weld, in his statement, said that “while I am suspending my candidacy, I want to be clear that I am not suspending my commitment to our nation and to the democratic institutions that set us apart.”    ",         Bill Weld suspends long-shot primary challenge against Trump,         2020-03-18T160125-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/bill-weld-suspends-long-shot-primary-challenge-against-trump,Fox

An unauthorized person somehow evaded U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) this morning to break into the Capitol building and smash a window on the second floor. While details of the break-in are scarce, the unnamed man was able to elude detection by police and gain access to the Capitol late yesterday evening or early Wednesday morning.  ""At approximately 8:10 a.m. today, an adult male was arrested by the United States Capitol Police for destruction of property on the west side of the U.S. Capitol.,"" USCP said in a statement. ""The incident continues to be under investigation, and additional charges may be forthcoming."" The suspect apparently got all the way to a balcony outside the second floor of the Capitol. There, the suspect allegedly broke a window onto the floor where the House chambers are and which looks out onto the National Mall.  CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW The window is near the House Republican Cloakroom and the main entrance to the House chamber -- the same door where the president walks into the chamber for the State of the Union.

The eight senators voting no were all Republicans: Sens. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, James Inhofe of Oklahoma, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, James Lankford of Oklahoma, Mike Lee of Utah, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Tim Scott of South Carolina. Critics said the mandate on small businesses to provide paid sick leave to workers was too much of a hardship when businesses are short on cash and can't wait for a federal tax credit reimbursement. “Small businesses in my state are closed,” Lankford said after the vote. “…Many small businesses are really struggling with how they're going to pay for this when they have no income coming in right now. They are hearing the promise of a federal reimbursement coming to them, but they don't know when that's coming and they're literally teetering on the edge right now.

"                          Power Line blog author Scott Johnson breaks down the story on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar unexpectedly praised President Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic on Wednesday night, saying it was ""incredible and the right response in this critical time."" Omar, normally a staunch critic of the White House who herself has repeatedly drawn the president's ire, went on to quote Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., as saying ""unprecedented times require unprecedented leadership"" -- and, Omar added, ""we are seeing that in our country right now."" ""Finally, we should never let politics get in the way of good policy,"" Omar concluded. ""This is a great start and hope others will be part of a united front to push for good policies that will help us work through the economic anxiety the country is feeling right now."" Omar was responding to a post by The Intercept's Lee Fang, who noted: ""Trump suspending mortgage foreclosures, demanding cash payments to Americans, now invoking the Defense Production Act to force private firms to produce needed supplies is incredible. Kind of a shell shock for anyone who reported on any economic policies in the Obama years."" Her praise for the president was matched this week by other Democrats and left-of-center commentators. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, on Tuesday, told reporters, “His team is on it. They’ve been responsive. ... I want to say thank you.” And, CNN's Dana Bash asserted that Trump's new tone on the coronavirus made him the ""kind of leader that people need."" On Wednesday, Trump invoked rarely used emergency powers to marshal critical medical supplies against the coronavirus pandemic. Trump tapped his authority under the 70-year-old Defense Production Act to give the government more power to steer production by private companies and try to overcome shortages in masks, ventilators and other supplies. TWO CONGRESSMEN TEST POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS Describing himself as a “wartime president” fighting an invisible enemy, the president also signed an aid package — which the Senate approved earlier Wednesday — that will guarantee sick leave to workers who fall ill. The Canada-U.S. border, the world's longest, was effectively closed, save for commerce and essential travel, while the administration pushed its plan to send relief checks to millions of Americans. Trump said he will expand the nation's diagnostic testing capacity and deploy a Navy hospital ship to New York City, which is rapidly becoming an epicenter of the pandemic, and another such ship to the West Coast. And the Housing and Urban Development Department will suspend foreclosures and evictions through April to help the growing number of Americans who face losing jobs and missing rent and mortgage payments. TRUMP SIGNS NEW CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE BILL -- WHAT'S IN IT? But as Trump laid out efforts to help the economy, markets plummeted. As reporters quizzed the White House as to whether the term ""Chinese virus"" is racist, or whether an unnamed White House staffer actually used the term ""Kung Flu,"" gone were thousands of jobs and nearly all the gains that the Dow Jones Industrial Average had made since Trump took office.

The vote was a lopsided 90-8 despite worries by many Republicans about a temporary new employer mandate to provide sick leave to workers who get COVID-19. The measure is also aimed at making tests for the virus-free. Meanwhile, the administration pushed forward its broad economic rescue plan, which proposes $500 billion in checks to millions of Americans, with the first checks to come April 6 if Congress approves.

That's an ""absolute total worst case scenario,"" Trump said. “We're no way near it."" The government has told Americans to avoid groups of more than 10 people and the elderly to stay home while a pointed reminder was given to millennials to follow the guidelines and avoid social gatherings. Trump likened the effort to the measures taken during World War II and said it would require national “sacrifice."" “It's a war,"" he said. ""I view it as a, in a sense, a wartime president. It's a very tough situation.” The White House has had several coronavirus-related health scares, with the president himself exposed to at least three people who later tested positive.

"                          White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow breaks down the coronavirus stimulus package and whats being done to help individuals and the economy during the outbreak. The White House is moving forward with a proposed $1 trillion coronavirus package that would infuse Americans' bank accounts with two rounds of direct cash payments. The Trump administration is seeking $250 billion in payments to Americans starting April 6, followed by another $250 billion cash payment round beginning May 18, according to the working draft of the plan obtained by Fox Business Network. The two payments to taxpayers would be identical and the amounts would vary by family income and size, according to the Treasury Department document on the ""Stage Three"" coronavirus proposal. The Washington Post first reported the document. AOC AND ALLIED PROGRESSIVES SEEK MONTHLY CASH PAYMENTS, RENT 'SUSPENSION' IN CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE The draft of the plan outlines a major economic infusion that goes well beyond the stimulus and bailout plans during the last financial crisis and designed to prop up an economy that has ground to a halt as stores and restaurants and schools are shuttering nationwide and families are isolating at home. The Trump administration’s stimulus package is bigger than the 2008 bank bailout, and the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which was passed and signed under former President Barack Obama and totaled $787 billion to help stabilize the economy about 14 months after the last recession began. Congress and President Trump already approved an $8.3 billion package to prop up the health care system to respond to the pandemic. The Senate Wednesday sent another bill to Trump's desk to give 14 paid sick days to workers, boost unemployment insurance, make coronavirus testing free and increase food assistance during the crisis; Trump signed it into law hours later. But, all sides have agreed that the government needed to pass a third round of stimulus as soon as possible to help small businesses stay afloat, aid workers who have lost jobs and give the economy a jolt as American consumers nationwide have been stuck home. TRUMP CALLS HIMSELF A ‘WARTIME PRESIDENT’ OVER CORONAVIRUS AS HE INVOKES DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT The administration's working plan amounts to $1 trillion on paper. It would provide $50 billion for lending to the airline industry, which has drastically reduced flights due to travel bans and social distancing. The proposal would require ""limits on increases in executive pay"" until the loans are repaid. The proposal calls for $150 billion to ""other severely distressed sectors of the U.S. economy"" through secured lending or loan guarantees. Trump signaled Wednesday that airlines, cruise ships and hotel industries are all ""prime candidates"" for support. The Trump administration also wants $300 billion to help small businesses, which have suffered under social isolation and various cities banning dine-in services at bars and restaurants in an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The administration would create a ""small business interruption loan program"" targeted at businesses with fewer than 500 employees that would cover six weeks of payroll. The amount for each employee's wages would be capped at $1,540 per week, or about $80,000 a year.

"                          'Fox News @ Night' anchor Shannon Bream delivers a 2020 update in 60 seconds on the biggest political stories. As Sen. Bernie Sanders takes time to “assess” his Democratic presidential nomination run after suffering more crushing setbacks in Tuesday’s primaries, Joe Biden’s campaign is spotlighting the former vice president’s “decisive” victories and illustrating how Vermont senator’s path to the nomination has all but closed. In a campaign memo widely distributed on Wednesday, Biden’s campaign touted that the former vice president topped Sanders by 39 percentage points in Florida and won every county in that state’s primary. SANDERS ASSESSES CAMPAIGN FUTURE AFTER TUESDAY'S SETBACKS TO BIDEN Biden’s landslide in Florida, his crushing defeat of Sanders in Illinois, and his win in Arizona cemented his status as the presumptive Democratic nominee and boosted his all-important convention delegate lead over Sanders to nearly 300. Deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield spotlighted that “Biden expanded his broad coalition to include new constituencies: Latinos, young voters, and more progressive parts of the Democratic party.” She contrasted the 2020 race with the two most recent contested Democratic presidential primaries.  “This primary is nowhere near as close as the 2008 and 2016 Democratic primaries. In 2016 Secretary Clinton did not open a 320+ delegate lead until the California primary on June 7, 2016. And at this point in 2008, President Obama had [about a] 100 delegate lead. Biden’s lead is three times that” Bedingfield noted. And pointing to progressive senator who’s making his second straight Democratic nomination bid, she emphasized, “In order to close the delegate deficit he faces, Senator Sanders would need to win every remaining contest by roughly 40 points.  That would require reaching 70 percent support, which is double his current national polling average of 35 percent.” Biden’s big lead in Georgia Sanders' campaign said the senator was heading back to his home state of Vermont later Wednesday – after the Senate voted on a massive coronavirus relief bill – to begin “holding conversations with supporters to get input and assess the path forward for our campaign.” A new poll in the state that was on deck in the primary calendar puts Biden ahead of Sanders by a three-to-one margin. According to a survey for the Atlanta Journal Constitution, Biden stood at 66 percent support among likely Democratic primary voters in Georgia, with Sanders at 22 percent. Georgia was scheduled to hold its primary next Tuesday, March 24. But  with the coronavirus pandemic spreading across the nation, officials postponed the contest for two months. Many of the states with upcoming primaries and caucuses are pushing back the dates of their contests – with other states very likely to follow. Biden vs. Trump poll position With Biden the all-but-certain presumptive nominee, a quick transition from the primary battle to a general election showdown with President Trump will likely soon occur. The most recent national polls conducted by live telephone operators indicate that Biden starts the race with Trump with the advantage. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll indicated Biden with a nine point advantage over the president – with CNN suggesting the former vice president holding a 10-point lead over Trump. But the race for the White House is not a national popular vote. If that were the case, then Hillary Clinton would be president. Instead, the presidential election is a battle for the states and their electoral votes. And a look at the latest live operator polling in some of the key battleground states spotlights a much closer contest. An NBC News/Marist poll in Ohio suggests Biden with a 49-45 percent edge. In Arizona, an NBC/Marist survey indicates the race basically deadlocked – with Biden at 47 percent support and the president at 46 percent. A Monmouth University poll in Arizona shows Biden with a slight 3 point lead. The latest poll in Michigan, from Monmouth University, puts Biden up over Trump 48-41 percent.  In 2016, Trump narrowly edged out Clinton in Michigan and two other reliably blue states – Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - boosting the GOP nominee into the White House. In Iowa, a Des Moines Register survey put Trump up by 10 points over Biden. New surveys in Virginia and North Carolina suggest Biden has the slight edge, while a new poll in Florida – the largest of the swing states – shows the president with a small advantage. Take all these polls with plenty of skepticism. It’s very early, the primary battle is technically not over, and the coronavirus outbreak will have a major impact – one way or another -- on public opinion in the race for the White House.

"                          Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Party of Wisconsin filed a lawsuit on Wednesday in the hopes of expanding voter access amid the coronavirus pandemic. The move by Democrats comes just weeks before the state is scheduled to hold its presidential primary and as concerns about voting mount during the COVID-19 outbreak.  “These steps are critical to ensuring that all Wisconsinites who wish to participate in the April 7 elections are able to do so,” DNC Chairman Tom Perez said in a statement. WHAT'S IN THE CORONAVIRUS BILL BEFORE CONGRESS Perez added: “Given the necessary measures taken by [Wisconsin] Governor Evers and public health officials in Wisconsin to limit the spread of the virus, it’s more important than ever that we expand access to voting, and increasing these necessary measures will help protect both public health and Wisconsinites' right to participate in our democracy.” The lawsuit aims to force election official in Wisconsin to extend the electronic and by-mail registration to April 3, suspend the requirement that copies of photo identification accompany absentee ballot requests and copies of proof of residency documents accompany voter registration requests.  The court filing also wants the state to extend its current deadline requiring absentee mail-in ballots to be received by 8 p.m. on Election Day to being postmarked by Election Day and received by municipal clerks’ offices within 10 days of the election. “Nobody should have to choose between exposure to COVID-19 and disenfranchisement,” Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Ben Wikler said. “The court should immediately strike down the barriers to full participation in voting by mail. Our democracy depends on our ability to conduct free, safe, and fair elections, no matter what—even during a pandemic.” Wisconsin – a key battleground state in this year’s presidential election – has been the focus of a number of lawsuits surrounding its voting process.  President Trump won the state by fewer than 23,000 votes in 2016, becoming the first Republican to win Wisconsin since 1984, after Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton infamously failed to campaign in the state. Democrats are trying to remedy their loss this election season by holding the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee this summer and aggressively targeting voters in the Badger State. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Earlier this month, a conservative law firm asked the Wisconsin Supreme Court to quickly overturn an appeals court ruling that stopped the purging of more than 200,000 people from the state's voter rolls, a move that Democrats argued was intended to make it more difficult for their voters to cast ballots. Moments after the filing, a conservative justice on the Supreme Court who previously sat out the case because he's on the ballot on April 7 said he would “rethink” that decision after the election. The court deadlocked 3-3 without Justice Dan Kelly's participation when asked to take the case earlier, so he could be a deciding vote. Wisconsin's presidential primary is April 7, but the appeal does not ask for the court to act in time for that election. A state appeals court last month overturned an Ozaukee County judge's ruling ordering the purge and dismissed the case, setting up this appeal. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

"                          The choices we make as individuals will collectively make a big difference to the pandemic, says Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. You had to keep scrolling down the home pages, whether it was the New York Times, Washington Post or some other outlet, to find out that Joe Biden had won three major primaries. The presidential campaign suddenly seemed ephemeral, a sidebar story, an afterthought. Even Biden’s brief victory speech, which focused mainly on the virus, had a weirdly disconnected vibe. It was a shaky livestream from Philadelphia, with no audience, and a delivery so low-key it was practically a golf whisper. TRUMP RAMPS UP AFTER DIRE REPORT, MEDIA ALSO GETTING LOW MARKS As the results came in showing landslide Biden wins over Bernie Sanders in Florida and Illinois, and by a narrower margin in Arizona, the cable news networks would dutifully report them -- almost with an “in other news” tone-- before switching back to virus coverage. And Ohio didn’t vote at all, with Gov. Mike DeWine postponing Tuesday’s primary at the last minute because of health concerns. With Maryland and Kentucky having joined Louisiana and Georgia in delaying their contents, the only major state voting between now and April 28 is Wisconsin, on April 7. In normal times, the press would be all over this race right now. Will Bernie drop out? Which woman will Biden pick as his running mate? Is he going too far to lure Sanders supporters? Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement yesterday that his boss in the coming weeks “is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign.” Beyond that, he said, the Vermont senator will remain focused on the government’s response to the virus. Biden, who won every county in Florida, is the obvious nominee. He needs to win just 46 percent of the remaining delegates for a majority, while Sanders needs 61 percent. I think Sanders was signaling that he’s going to hang around but not really run, as a way of keeping a sliver of the media spotlight and make his pitch for progressive causes. But he may have waved half a tattered white flag. (Axios had to retract a story saying Sanders was suspending his campaign.) But Biden is still courting Bernie’s supporters, saying Tuesday night that he and Sanders “may disagree on tactics, but we share a common vision” on health care, inequality and climate change. “I hear you. I know what’s at stake.” The former vice president of course needs Bernie’s diehards not to stay home, but the danger here is that he’ll move too far left for a general election. He’s trouncing Sanders, who shouldn’t be able to dictate the surrender terms.

He has previously worked in various leadership roles with the House Republican Conference and the Republican Study Committee and was the vice president of the conservative Heritage Action for America. ""Since joining OMB, Russ has overseen the delivery of four of the most conservative presidential budgets to date,"" Heritage Foundation President Kay C.

CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW TRUMP SIGNS 2ND CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE BILL HOURS AFTER SENATE PASSAGE Vought was confirmed to be the deputy director of the OMB in early 2018 by a razor-thin margin after Vice President Pence broke a 49-49 tie. The vote was strictly along party lines. Accusations of Islamophobia based on previous writings were largely what made Vought's confirmation so controversial. Vought, a Christian, wrote in an article defending a Christian school that fired a professor for saying Muslims and Christians worship the same God. He cited theologians in a lengthy piece, which at one point said that Muslims ""do not know God because they have rejected Jesus Christ his son, and they stand condemned."" ""Are you suggesting,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., asked Vought at a hearing, ""that all of those people stand condemned? What about Jews, do they stand condemned, too?"" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Vought countered, ""Senator, I am a Christian,"" and explained that his religion teaches respect for all ""regardless of their religious beliefs."" It is unclear when the Senate will take up Vought's nomination.

More members of Congress are now going into self-quarantine as a precaution after two fellow lawmakers tested positive for coronavirus. House Minority Whip Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., announced that he is going into quarantine after learning that Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, with whom he recently met, tested positive for COVID-19. REPS. MARIO DIAZ-BALART, BEN MCADAMS ARE FIRST LAWMAKERS TO ANNOUNCE TESTING POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS “Since I had an extended meeting with him late last week out of an abundance of caution, I have decided it would be best to self-quarantine based on the guidance of the Attending Physician of the United States Congress,” Scalise said in a statement, noting that he is “not experiencing any symptoms, and will continue working remotely on Congress’ Coronavirus response[.]” Diaz-Balart and Rep. Ben McAdams, D-Utah, are the first two members of Congress to announce they have been infected. McAdams told constituents of his status and his “mild cold-like symptoms” after learning his test results Wednesday. The Office of the Attending Physician sent a memo to all House members regarding lawmakers who tested positive. “My office has taken appropriate actions to identify any individuals who require additional monitoring for periods of quarantine,” said the memo from Dr. Brian Monahan, which was obtained by Fox News. “The office has adopted a very conservative guideline to identify individuals who may have come into contact with the ill Members during the pre-symptomatic period of March 13th. The office has additionally reviewed possible exposures among staff members and has assessed other areas involving the calendars of the affected individuals.” The memo went on to say that the attending physician’s office “identified the offices and locations that were found to be at risk and these have been treated by the Architect of the Capitol, using CDC approved cleaning methods to ensure there is no residual risk to others.” The memo went on to say that the attending physician’s office is focusing on situations where people had substantial contact with the infected congressmen. “Other instances where the affected Members may have briefly come into contact with other colleagues on the House Floor would be considered to be low risk exposures and no additional measures are required other than for them to report any illness should they become ill,” it said. Rep. Kathleen Rice, D-N.Y., then issued a statement late Wednesday night announcing her own self-quarantine. “I learned this evening that someone I was in contact with last Friday tested positive for COVID-19. After consultation with the Attending Physician and out of an abundance of caution for those around me, I will be self-quarantining until March 27th,” Rice said.

"                          President Trump signs Senate bill to guarantee sick leave for workers who fall ill during the coronavirus pandemic. Congress, a branch of the government not known for its ability to act quickly and certainly not known for coming to broad consensus on important issues, has done both of those things as it has shepherded two coronavirus-related spending bills to President Trump's desk in two weeks and is feverishly working to put together a third, blockbuster package that could be worth upward of $1 trillion. Trump's signing of the second coronavirus bill, which will provide $100 billion worth of paid sick leave, unemployment help and free virus testing to Americans, comes as the coronavirus pandemic is hitting close to home on Capitol Hill. On Wednesday, Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., and Ben McAdams, D-Utah, were the first two members of Congress to test positive for the disease officially known as COVID-19. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW TRUMP SIGNS 2ND CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE BILL HOURS AFTER SENATE PASSAGE ""I want everyone to know that I am feeling much better,"" Diaz-Balart said in a statement on his diagnosis. ""We must continue to work together to emerge stronger as a country during these trying times."" Congress is certainly working together. The Senate managed to pass the House coronavirus bill without amendments by a 90-8 margin, sending it to Trump's desk just two days after the House passed a technical fix to the legislation. The expedited passage of the House legislation was a stark departure from the usual interaction between the chambers. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the self-styled ""Grim Reaper"" for the House's ""socialist agenda,"" has been at odds with House Democrats since they took control of the lower chamber in early 2019.

And even before the Senate ushered through the second bill, members of Congress and the Trump administration were falling over each other to offer up ideas for another piece of legislation. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, and Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, each proposed different ideas for how the government could send checks directly to Americans who are financially strapped because of the economic slowdown. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., confirmed Tuesday on Sirius XM's ""The Michael Smerconish Program"" that a ""one-time distribution of $1,000 to every adult citizen"" was ""being seriously discussed."" CORONAVIRUS IN CONGRESS SENDS MORE LAWMAKERS INTO SELF-QUARANTINE, AS DOCTORS TRACK EXPOSURE Monday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced he would propose at least $750 billion in spending to fight the coronavirus crisis before it came out the next day that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin pitched Republican senators on $850 billion in spending for the same purpose. Then reports came out Wednesday that the third coronavirus package might actually be worth $1 trillion or more, as the administration urges two rounds of stimulus checks to Americans. McConnell Tuesday said he would break off Republican senators into task forces to write up parts of the GOP version of the third coronavirus response bill in coordination with the White House. ""This is a herculean task, from a legislative point of view, to try to craft something this significant with 53 people,"" McConnell said. ""Everyone has a way to funnel in their suggestions to one of these three task forces. These task forces will be working with the Treasury Department and Secretary Mnuchin and his team, to see if we can reach a Republican consensus so we know where we are."" He said he then plans to sit down with Schumer and work out the differences between the Republican proposal and the Democratic proposal before working to quickly pass the third-stage legislation. ILHAN OMAR PRAISES TRUMP'S 'INCREDIBLE' RESPONSE TO CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC In a Wednesday Dear Colleague letter to her Democratic members, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., prepared them for the third coronavirus bill, which she said would be focused on ""Unemployment Insurance, increased Medicaid funding and further assistance to small businesses. ""As we proceed with further legislation, we all see this tragic pandemic as a challenge for us to shape an economy that puts Families First,"" she wrote in the letter. She continued: ""The coronavirus pandemic has brought great pain to our country, but we must be hopeful that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Science has given us reason to be hopeful, and the best minds in America are working all hands on deck. Take pride in your support for our first bill, which allocated billions of dollars for research for treatments and a vaccine and in our second bill putting Families First, focusing on testing, testing, testing."" TYPICALLY PARTISAN SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS BECOME SOURCE OF CORONAVIRUS INFO AS PANDEMIC TRANSCENDS PARTISANSHIP Pelosi said in the letter she planned a Thursday conference call with her caucus.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Wednesday that it will temporarily halt some of its deportation efforts amid the coronavirus pandemic, except for those deemed a safety risk or under mandatory deportation order due to criminal history. The delay is intended to help mitigate the spread of the virus and to encourage people to seek testing and treatment, ICE said in a statement. “During the COVID-19 crisis, ICE will not carry out enforcement operations at or near health care facilities, such as hospitals, doctors’ offices, accredited health clinics, and emergent or urgent care facilities, except in the most extraordinary of circumstances,” the agency said. “Individuals should not avoid seeking medical care because they fear civil immigration enforcement.” Brandon Judd: Coronavirus pandemic requires US to adopt new policy to quickly deport illegal immigrants The statement added the agency would seek alternatives to detention but didn’t say what might happen to the approximately 37,000 current immigration detainees, The Washington Post reported. The agency said it would continue critical investigations into child exploitation, gangs, narcotics trafficking, human trafficking and terrorism. On Thursday, Acting Deputy Homeland Security Secretary Ken Cuccinelli clarified the statement in light of what he called ""widespread misreporting."" ""The health and safety of Americans is paramount. Thus, ICE will, as it has during other times of crisis, conduct enforcement operations that protect our communities and uphold our laws. This means that ICE will continue to prioritize arresting and removing criminal aliens and other aliens who pose a threat to public safety, just as it always has during President Trump’s administration,"" he said. ""That does not mean that no other removable aliens will in fact be removed, but during the current public health situation, removals will be done in such a way as to minimize the exposure of our agents and of the removable aliens we are encountering,"" he said. ""ICE will exercise its law enforcement authority in a manner that accounts for the dangers presented by COVID-19, while maintaining the safety and security of the communities it has sworn to protect.” Immigration advocates have urged ICE to release detainees who could be at a higher risk for contracting the virus due to cramped quarters, according to the Post. As of Tuesday, no detainees had yet tested positive for the virus. All immigration hearings have also been halted except for those already detained, according to The Post.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on Thursday urged President Trump to ""immediately"" wield his powers under the Defense Production Act to combat the coronavirus crisis, a day after he said he would invoke it but does not yet need to use the powers available to him. “The President must immediately use the powers of the Defense Production Act to mass produce and coordinate distribution of these critical supplies, before the need worsens and the shortages become even more dire,” the California Democrat said in a statement. “There is not a day to lose. We must put more testing, more protective equipment and more ventilators into the hands of our frontline workers immediately.” TRUMP ANNOUNCES HE IS INVOKING DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT TO FIGHT CORONAVIRUS Trump announced Wednesday that he was invoking the act, saying it “can do a lot of good things if we need it.” The act, which was first enacted in 1950 as a response to the Korean War and has since been re-invoked more than 50 times, would streamline production of medical supplies to help the country battle the coronavirus pandemic and require businesses to sign contracts or fulfill orders deemed necessary for national defense. It’s part of an expansive effort to combat the coronavirus pandemic that has shut down most of daily life in the U.S. in recent weeks. But he tweeted late Wednesday that he was only using it if deemed necessary ""in a worst case scenario."" TRUMP INVOKES DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT: WHAT IS IT? “I only signed the Defense Production Act to combat the Chinese Virus should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future,” he tweeted. “Hopefully there will be no need, but we are all in this TOGETHER!” For Pelosi and other Democrats, that need is already there. “Right now, shortages of critical medical and personal protective equipment are harming our ability to fight the coronavirus epidemic, endangering frontline workers and making it harder to care for those who fall ill,” she said.

Another attendee of last month’s Conservative Political Action Conference has tested positive for coronavirus, the D.C. government says. Earlier this week, District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser announced an updated count of individuals who tested positive for the disease caused by the virus, COVID-19, bringing the total in Washington to 31. CORONAVIRUS AT CPAC: DIAGNOSIS TRIGGERS SCRAMBLE TO TRACE EXPOSURE Bowser said Tuesday the new cases included one 23-year-old male. D.C.'s government said it is tracing the potential contact with others for all these cases but specifically noted the 23-year-old “Attended CPAC conference.” A spokesman for CPAC told Fox News they have reached out to D.C. health officials to try to track down any additional information. Meanwhile, Fox News has learned that the first infected CPAC attendee, who reports indicate is a New York City-based doctor, has left the hospital in New Jersey where he was being treated for COVID-19 and is now completing his recovery at home. A CPAC spokesman told Fox News Thursday that the organization has been in direct contact with that individual and his family to track his progress and recovery. The first case set off a behind-the-scenes scramble to identify who else the individual had been in contact with, prompting top Republican lawmakers to go into quarantine.

"                          A new government study is shedding more light on the properties of COVID-19; William La Jeunesse has the details. The Energy Department announced Thursday that it will purchase 77 million barrels of American-made crude oil to begin to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve amid the coronavirus outbreak. “DOE is moving quickly to support U.S. oil producers facing potentially catastrophic losses from the impacts of COVID-19 and the intentional disruption to world oil markets by foreign actors,” Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette said in a statement Thursday. GAS PRICES COULD HIT 99 CENTS IN SOME STATES DUE TO CORONAVIRUS AND SUPPLIES, EXPERT SAYS The Energy Department is expected to purchase an initial 30 million barrels of crude oil, with a focus on small to midsize U.S. oil producers. “The small to midsize oil producers, which are the focus of the initial crude oil purchase, employ thousands of Americans,” Under Secretary Mark Menezes said. “These businesses have been particularly hard hit by recent events but under President Trump’s leadership, we are taking swift action to assist hard hit producers and deliver strong returns to the taxpayer.” The department said that Thursday’s move is the first step in filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to its maximum capacity, and noted that they are working with Congress to “finalize the funding to support the purchase.” The move comes amid President Trump’s “whole of government” approach and public-private partnerships to combat the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States.

"                          Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard, member of the Hawaii National Guard, joins Shannon Bream on 'Fox News @ Night.' Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has suspended her long-shot campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. She made the announcement in a video posted to Twitter on Thursday. The move comes as former Vice President Joe Biden consolidates support in the party and builds a massive delegate lead over his only remaining rival in the primary race, Sen. Bernie Sanders. Gabbard, in the video, offered her ""full support"" to Biden. FIVE THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT TULSI GABBARD But Gabbard also praised Sanders. Gabbard, who backed the populist senator's 2016 White House bid, said: ""I have great appreciation for Senator Sanders' love for our country and the American people and his sincere desire to improve the lives of all Americans."" Gabbard – a four-term congresswoman who in 2012 became the first Hindu elected to Congress – launched her presidential campaign in January of last year. The Hawaii National Guard officer who served in the Iraq War advocated for a foreign policy that stressed that the U.S. stay out of overseas conflicts and entanglements.  But Gabbard was repeatedly criticized for her January 2017 trip to Syria – where she met with Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad and toured the city of Aleppo after it had been blasted to rubble by Assad’s regime. Gabbard’s anti-intervention stance was blasted by 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton – who referred to the congresswoman as “the favorite of the Russians” and suggested Gabbard was being groomed as a third-party candidate for the general election. Gabbard, saying she was defamed by Clinton, sued her in January for $100 million. Clinton has moved to dismiss the lawsuit. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN  The 38-year candidate – who was the second youngest contender in the race after former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg – also had to apologize early in her campaign for past anti-gay comments and actions. A decade and a half earlier, she actively promoted “traditional marriage” and several times referred to LGBTQ activists as “homosexual extremists.” Gabbard also repeatedly clashed with the Democratic National Committee over their presidential nomination debate criteria – which prevented the congresswoman and many of her rivals from making the stage. Earlier this month she was one of the first in Congress to push for universal basic income payments – made popular by former 2020 rival Andrew Yang – as a way to provide instant relief to Americans affected by the massive economic downturn caused by the coronavirus outbreak. GABBARD PUSHES UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME AS CORONAVIRUS ECONOMIC RELIEF Gabbard, who's said she won't run for re-election to her House seat, embraced the concept of universal basic income last year. In an apparent effort to try and attract Yang supporters, Gabbard said hours after Yang ended his bid in February that she would continue “to carry the torch” for his Freedom Dividend.       Democratic presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard joins supporters after filing to place her name on New Hampshire's presidential primary ballot, in Concord, NH in Nov. 2019.       The candidate spent much of her time early this year campaigning in New Hampshire – which holds the first primary in the White House race and votes second in the nominating calendar, after Iowa. Gabbard even rented a home in the state. But she finished a disappointing seventh place in the primary, winning only 3 percent of the vote. She barely registered in the Nevada caucuses and won just 1 percent of the vote in the South Carolina primary and in many of the Super Tuesday contests. But Gabbard stayed in the race – even after every candidate other than Biden and Sanders dropped out.  2020 PRIMARY RESULTS AND DELEGATE COUNT In the contests the past two weeks, Gabbard often won fewer votes than candidates who had already departed the race. In Tuesday’s primary in Florida, the congresswoman grabbed less than 1 percent of the vote, finishing behind former candidates Mike Bloomberg, Buttigieg, and Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. She won just two delegates in the nomination race – both coming from her native American Samoa.

The State Department is expected to soon advise against all international travel amid the global coronavirus pandemic, Fox News had learned. A U.S. official told Fox News on Thursday that the State Department will soon raise its global travel advisory to a Level 4, “Do Not Travel,” which is the most severe warning on State’s advisory scale. ENERGY DEPARTMENT BUYING MILLIONS OF BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL TO FILL STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE The State Department, before the outbreak of COVID-19 around the globe, had reserved Level 4 for Libya, North Korea, Afghanistan, Somalia, Syria, Burkina Faso, South Sudan, Yemen, Venezuela, Central African Republic, Mali, Iran, Iraq and Haiti. State also had designated parts of countries Level 4, like Sinaloa state in Mexico, due to cartel violence, or areas of southern and eastern Turkey due to terrorism and war. The move comes after the department had implemented a global Level 3 advisory over the weekend, which warned Americans to reconsider traveling abroad. The World Health Organization designated COVID-19 a global pandemic last week. TRUMP TO EXTEND EUROPEAN TRAVEL BAN TO INCLUDE UK, IRELAND AMID CORONAVIRUS  Following that designation, President Trump announced a temporary halt on air travel to the United States from Europe, initially excluding flights from the United Kingdom and those carrying cargo, in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. Trump then declared a national emergency over the outbreak and moved to ban travel from the U.K. as well. This week, the president and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also agreed to largely close the U.S.-Canada border to curb the spread of the virus.

Citing Chinese threats to disrupt the supply of pharmaceutical products the communist nation exports to the United States and plunge America into ""the mighty sea of coronavirus,"" Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Rep Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., introduced a bill Wednesday to cut U.S. reliance on pharmaceutical products coming from China. ""The Chinese Communist Party threatened to cut off America’s access to vital drugs in the midst of a pandemic caused by its own failures,"" Cotton said in a statement announcing the bill. ""It’s time to pull America’s supply chains for life-saving medicine out of China and make the CCP pay for contributing to this global emergency."" A release announcing the bill says it would task an FDA registry with tracking drug ingredients, ban the federal government from buying drugs with a supply chain that originates in China, require drugs to be labeled with the name of the country where they came from and provide benefits to manufacturers who make their drugs or medical equipment in the U.S. The bill would go into effect in 2022. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW TRUMP UNAPOLOGETICALLY USES PHRASE 'CHINESE VIRUS' AS CLASH ESCALATES WITH CHINA OVER ITS ORIGINS ""The Chinese Communist Party’s outrageous threats to withhold lifesaving drugs from the U.S. endangers public health and should open our eyes to our dangerous over-reliance on China in our medical supply chain,” Gallagher said. “This is a national security imperative that to many Americans, is a matter of life and death. It’s past time for us to develop an aggressive plan to move critical pharmaceutical supply chains away from China."" Currently, most drug components used in the United States are made internationally, and that supply is largely in China. The communist nation supplies between 80 percent and 90 percent of American antibiotics and 70 percent of acetaminophen used in the United States, according to Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. Cotton and Gallagher aren't the first members of Congress to introduce a bill aimed at bolstering the independence of America's medical supply chain. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., introduced such a bill alongside Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J. And Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., introduced his own version. But the Cotton and Gallagher bill comes as tensions between the U.S. and China have reached a fever pitch with leaders from both nations assigning blame for the coronavirus pandemic -- which originated in Wuhan, China and according to a study could have been reduced by 95 percent had Chinese authorities intervened just three weeks earlier -- to the other. RUBIO, GINGRICH: CORONAVIRUS LAYS BARE CHINA'S POWER OVER PUBLIC HEALTH, ECONOMY -- HERE'S WHAT MUST HAPPEN NOW President Trump tweeted four times about the ""Chinese Virus"" Wednesday while also doubling down on the terminology when asked whether it was racist during a press conference. ""Because it's from China. It's not racist at all, no. Not at all. It comes from China,"" Trump said. ""That's why. It comes from China. I want to be accurate.""

"                          Cities across the U.S. becoming ghost towns; many Americans without jobs as Coronavirus cases continue to rise. Acting Deputy Homeland Security Secretary Ken Cuccinelli on Thursday sought to clarify a statement from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that indicated it was halting most deportations due to the coronavirus outbreak -- with Cuccinelli pledging that deportations would still go ahead, but with increased safety precautions. “In light of widespread misreporting, clarification of ICE’s recent announcement about enforcement during the COVID-19 situation is needed,” Cuccinelli said in a statement. US IMMIGRATION OFFICES CLOSE UNTIL APRIL OVER CORONAVIRUS FEARS ICE said Wednesday that its enforcement and removal operations (ERO) would focus on “public safety risks and individuals subject to mandatory detention based on criminal grounds.” “For those individuals who do not fall into those categories, ERO will exercise discretion to delay enforcement actions until after the crisis or utilize alternatives to detention, as appropriate,” the statement said. The shift is in response to the coronavirus outbreak, which is highly contagious and led to government officials calling on Americans to practice social distancing and remain at home whenever possible. Activists who advocate for illegal immigrants had called on ICE to release detainees from immigration detention where possible to reduce the risk of spreading the virus in crowded areas. The ICE announcement was seen as an indication that most deportations would be delayed. It remains to be seen what percentage of removal operations could be put on hold due to the health emergency. But Cuccinelli, saying that “the health and safety of Americans is paramount,” promised that ICE will “conduct enforcement operations that protect our communities and uphold our laws.” “This means that ICE will continue to prioritize arresting and removing criminal aliens and other aliens who pose a threat to public safety, just as it always has during President Trump’s administration,” he said. He went on to say that, while those exceptions hold, some other removal operations will still continue with increased precautions to protect both agents and those being apprehended. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE “That does not mean that no other removable aliens will in fact be removed, but during the current public health situation, removals will be done in such a way as to minimize the exposure of our agents and of the removable aliens we are encountering,” he clarified. “ICE will exercise its law enforcement authority in a manner that accounts for the dangers presented by COVID-19, while maintaining the safety and security of the communities it has sworn to protect.” The announcement comes a day after  U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which deals mainly with legal immigration, announced that its offices across the country will close as part of the effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The suspension of services will last until at least April 1, although it will still process emergency requests. But asylum applications, naturalization ceremonies and other services will be postponed. The agency, which is the core agency dealing with most forms of legal immigration and asylum cases in the U.S., will send notices to immigrants and applicants affected by the delay, and interviews will be rescheduled, the agency said.

"                          President Trump says an old malaria drug called hydroxychloroquine has shown very encouraging early result against coronavirus President Trump announced Thursday that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is making experimental drugs -- including those used for treating malaria -- available as part of the ongoing effort to tackle the spread of the coronavirus. Trump announced at a White House press briefing that chloroquine, a drug designed for use in malaria, has been FDA approved and will be made available by prescription ""almost immediately.""

When asked about allegations his administration had been slow in responding to the crisis, he took issue with the premise of the question -- pointing to his order to restrict travel from China -- and said it could have been contained if only the Chinese government had done more. ""It could have been contained to that one area in China where it started,"" Trump said. ""And certainly the world is paying a big price for what they did.""

"                          Jonathan Hunt reports on efforts to recover an American Marine turned journalist who was kidnapped terrorists in Syria. President Trump on Thursday called on Syria to help secure the release of kidnapped journalist Austin Tice, who was taken hostage by jihadist militants in the war-torn nation almost eight years ago. During a news conference by the White House coronavirus task force, Trump implied that the regime of Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad was holding Tice and asked the country to release him on humanitarian grounds. “Syria, please work with us, and we would appreciate you letting him out,” Trump said. “We’ve done a lot for Syria and we have to see if they’re going to do this. It would be very much appreciated if they let Austin Tice out immediately.” FAMILY OF KIDNAPPED JOURNALIST AUSTIN TICE FIGHTS TO KEEP CASE ALIVE 7 YEARS AFTER KIDNAPPING: 'THIS IS A VIABLE MISSION' Trump said he could not confirm that Tice is alive, but he would like the journalist to be released from captivity if he is. ""If he is alive, we would like to get him back very quickly,"" Trump said. Tice, a former captain in the U.S. Marine Corps, had traveled to Syria as an independent journalist in May of 2012, before his final year at Georgetown Law School. The Texas native was covering events in Syria for McClatchy, The Washington Post and other news organizations when he disappeared just days after turning 31. About five weeks after his disappearance, a 43-second video emerged online showing him in the captivity of what his family described as an ""unusual group of apparent jihadists."" The men in the video have Tice bound and blindfolded. They chanted ""Allah-Akbar"" throughout the clip and at one point, forced him to recite a prayer in broken Arabic. Tice's mother, Debra, said last year that she's “reasonably hopeful” that her son might be found, but also expressed frustration at a senior administration official, who has allegedly been obstructing the effort. She also credited Trump for pushing harder than the Obama administration did to secure her son's release. FAMILY OF KIDNAPPED JOURNALIST AUSTIN TICE FIGHTS TO KEEP CASE ALIVE 7 YEARS AFTER KIDNAPPING: 'THIS IS A VISIBLE MISSION' “This administration is pressing it much more diligently than the previous administration,” she told McClatchy. “There is a deliberate, concerted effort to make this happen. I think it has not happened because somewhere at the senior level there’s some kind of obstruction,"" Debra Tice added. In June 2017, the New York Times reported that then-CIA Director and current Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had reached out to a Syrian government official in an effort to secure Tice's release. The backchannel shut down, however, after Syria launched a nerve gas attack on rebel-held territory in the northern part of the country. The Trump administration responded with a missile strike and negotiations fell through. In April 2018, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) offered a $1 million reward ""for information leading directly to the safe location, recovery, and return of"" the former Marine. Pompeo called upon the Syrian government to release Tice, and any other American hostages being held in Syria, back in September while addressing members of the media. ""The Trump administration never forgets about Americans wrongfully detained or held hostage abroad,"" he said. ""Among the more than 100,000 people who have been detained or disappeared in Assad's prisons is American journalist Austin Tice.

"                          Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says the economy is slowing to a standstill as COVID-19 spreads. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, joined by top Democratic senators, on Thursday rolled out a plan that would cancel student loan payments for the duration of the coronavirus national emergency and pay down some outstanding debt. Schumer, D-N.Y., joined by Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, unveiled their emergency student loan payment and relief plan, after floating measures to curb the economic impact of COVID-19. TRUMP SAYS HUD WILL SUSPEND ALL FORECLOSURES, EVICTIONS DURING CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK The plan would provide relief to federal student loan borrowers through an “immediate cancellation” of monthly student loan payments during the national emergency, and would “pay down a minimum of $10K for all federal student loan borrowers.” The plan would require Congress to authorize the Department of Education to make monthly student loan payments on behalf of borrowers, and would “guarantee” the minimum of $10,000 payoff for all borrowers. “The coronavirus outbreak brought with it crushing economic uncertainty, and students and borrowers need targeted, quick relief from payment burdens,” Schumer said in a statement Thursday. “Our new proposal would immediately cancel monthly payments, and give students and borrowers a minimum $10K student loan payoff. We must act now to help alleviate the growing financial strain on students and families across the country.” SCHUMER SAYS US 'ALMOST CERTAINLY' WILL SEE A RECESSION AMID COVID-19 PANDEMIC Warren, whose presidential campaign focused on cancellation of student loan debt, added that the measure would “fix the mistake that still holds back a generation of people and dragged down our economy.” The suspension of payments would be considered a new policy, separate from the deferment and forbearance options that currently exist for borrowers. The plan would also make all payments made by the Department of Education “tax-free” for borrowers. The proposal comes after President Trump, last week, announced that he had waived all interest on federal student loans during the coronavirus outbreak rocking the nation. Meanwhile, Trump on Wednesday signed the second coronavirus relief bill into law that provides paid sick leave, unemployment help and free testing to Americans. The legislation provides 14 days of paid sick days to workers affected by the coronavirus, ensures free testing to everyone, including the uninsured, and expands food aid and boosts unemployment dollars to states. Next up, the Senate and White House have been moving quickly to draft a third round of stimulus legislation that could infuse about $1 trillion into the U.S. economy that has been rattled by school shutdowns, business closures and steep declines in the travel and tourism industry as many Americans are stuck home. Schumer, Warren, Murray and Brown have included the student loan measure as part of Senate Democrats’ “Phase 3” stimulus proposal. Also expected to be included in the third stimulus package are the ""checks"" that the Trump and the White House have vowed Americans would soon receive. It is unclear, at this point, who would be eligible to receive the relief, and how much cash eligible individuals could expect. The House and Senate already passed a bipartisan $8.3 billion package to prop up the health-care system to prepare for the influx of sick Americans. The second response bill that was signed into law Wednesday aims to bring relief to workers who lost their jobs and families at home for illnesses, quarantines or caring for kids whose schools have shuttered. As of Thursday morning, the U.S. currently had more than 9,400 confirmed cases of coronavirus in all 50 states, including Washington, D.C. The U.S., so far, has seen 150 COVID-19-related deaths. The Trump administration’s task force predicted Tuesday that the number of cases in the U.S. could peak in about 45 days.

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., has called on “low-risk” inmates in federal prisons to be released from custody following reports that two prisoners in California are in quarantine after coming in contact with a person who tested positive for coronavirus.  Harris, a onetime Democratic presidential hopeful, sent a letter on Thursday to Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) Director Michael Carvajal arguing that the close quarters prisoners live in – paired with the strict measures the BOP is taking distance inmates from the public – makes them particularly susceptible to the COVID-19 virus. “In the midst of this crisis, BOP should be taking reasonable steps to reduce the incarcerated population and guard against potential exposure to coronavirus,” Harris said. “At this time, BOP—in coordination with the U.S. Department of Justice — can and should request the release of low-risk individuals who are in pretrial detention because of money bail.” TRUMP SIGNS 2ND CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE BILL HOURS AFTER SENATE PASSAGE Harris continued: “But instead, it appears that BOP is responding to the threat of coronavirus with extreme measures that both maintain current levels of incarceration and penalize the incarcerated community— including by suspending social and legal visitation, suspending inmate facility transfers, and potentially locking down institutions.” Harris’ letter comes shortly after a report in the San Jose Mercury News that two inmates in the Santa Clara County Jail have been quarantined after being interviewed by a defense attorney who tested positive for COVID-19. The infected person is reportedly an attorney with the county Public Defender’s Office.

While widespread outbreaks of coronavirus behind bars have yet to happen, the frenzy of legal activity underscores a crude reality that's only beginning to sink in: America's nearly 7,000 jails, prisons and correction facilities are an ideal breeding ground for the virus, as dangerous as nursing homes and cruise ships but far less sanitary. Stepped-up cleanings and a temporary halt to visitations at many lockups across the country in the midst of the crisis can't make up for the fact that ventilation behind bars is often poor, inmates sleep in close quarters and share a small number of bathrooms.

"                          Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden releases coronavirus plan, criticizes Trump administration's response; reaction from Chris Plante, syndicated radio host, and Ethan Bearman, host of 'Left Coast News.' For most of early 2019, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden — the declared custodian of liberalism who would continue the Obama glory years — seemed unstoppable. He led all other rivals for months. Biden seemed above the fray. Many Democrats saw the pre-debate and pre-election race for the nomination as more of a Biden coronation than a contest. In the summer and fall debates of 2019, Biden was occasionally confused about dates, places, names and facts. In public appearances, he often seemed grouchy or dazed. LESLIE MARSHALL: SANDERS SHOULD END CAMPAIGN – PRIMARY WINS SHOW BIDEN WILL BE DEM PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE Biden was once faulted for being too handsy in his interactions with women; now he was being criticized for losing his temper and insulting people during campaign stops. Biden dived in the polls. Democratic candidates such as Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Julian Castro, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren had all wounded the septuagenarian Biden, portraying him as too moderate and out of touch with contemporary green and diversity issues. Meanwhile, rival Bernie Sanders in the new year took over the lead in the polls. He focused on evil corporations, an unfair America and a rigged system. His populism drew crowds even as his socialism terrified the Democratic Party establishment. By early 2020, Sanders was feared to be unstoppable. Multibillionaire former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg jumped into the race with a storm of endorsements and paid ads. Bloomberg was supposed to save the Democratic Party from Sanders’ socialism in the wake of Biden’s implosion. Then the unanticipated happened. Sanders began praising Cuba and other Marxist countries, thereby confirming criticism that he really was too soft on communism. Bloomberg entered his first two debates and performed dismally. Almost overnight, he nullified his $500 million investment in a radio, television, social media and mailing campaign. But Biden just stayed Ol’ Joe Biden — occasional bewilderment, gaffes and all. As others sank in the polls, Biden seemed a known quantity in comparison. Other events lined up in Biden’s favor. The primaries headed to the South and West, where there were more moderate voters. On Super Tuesday, Biden was seen as less risky than Sanders and won a majority of delegates. Bloomberg dropped out of the race, as did Biden’s younger rivals — and most of them endorsed Biden. At no time did Biden cease his bloopers or embarrassing moments of forgetfulness and confusion. The field changed, not Biden himself. After Super Tuesday, Biden was, by process of elimination, suddenly the front-runner again in one of the more amazing comebacks in primary history. Democrats may have dodged the Sanders socialist bullet and united the party behind Biden, but how will Biden beat Trump? Biden’s threefold strategy is obvious. First, Biden will copy the Bloomberg playbook and avoid campaign appearances as much as possible, instead relying on ads, endorsements and the occasional short, teleprompter-aided speech. Biden also will name administration officials in advance and use a dozen or so of them as surrogates and anti-Trump attack dogs on the campaign trail. The subtext will be that the abstract idea of Biden is preferable to the concrete reality of hearing him speak or seeing him in action. Second, Biden’s running mate, with a wink and a nod, will be sold as the likely future president sooner than later. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Diversity candidates who did not run effective campaigns and dropped out of the race now have a chance to be revived as Biden’s running mate — with a real shot to be president or at least to have a more influential role than past vice presidents. Such a running mate could help Biden win over the base. And he or she could solve the Democratic Party’s embarrassing dilemma of damning white privilege while ending up with two elderly white men as finalists for the nomination. Third, no one knows the trajectory of the coronavirus, but the economic damage it is inflicting on the economy is already considerable. Democratic strategists are demagoguing it in a way that seems analogous to the freak storm Katrina, which wrecked the second term of George W.

CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP In 2020 we will hear a lot from candidate Biden — but less frequently will we see him in person, speaking to or mixing with crowds. His running mate will be advertised as the future of the Democratic Party, with the subtext of soon becoming president. And the 24/7 message won’t be collusion or impeachment, but the coronavirus. There are problems with all of these strategies.

"                          Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell provides updates on the coronavirus funding bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell signaled Thursday that the third phase of Congress’ coronavirus response plan would aim to deliver stimulus checks to the majority of Americans in a bid to provide relief to families under economic strain “as rapidly as possible.” McConnell, R-Ky., speaking on the floor, outlined the emerging Senate GOP proposal to provide “direct financial help” as the nation grapples with the COVID-19 global pandemic. MNUCHIN SAYS WH LOOKING TO SEND $1,000 CHECKS TO MOST AMERICANS WITHIN 3 WEEKS  “Senate Republicans want to put cash in the hands of the American people,” McConnell said Thursday, noting that lawmakers are currently finalizing a structure that can quickly send assistance to Americans. An outstanding question has been whether the aid would be restricted based on income and work status. McConnell indicated job status would not be a factor, and that the money would go to unemployed workers and those recently laid off; those still working; and retirees, even if they're already receiving Social Security checks. While officials have indicated the ultra-rich would not be eligible, McConnell said Thursday the checks would still go to everybody ""from the middle class on down. Period."" How the middle class is defined can be a contentious subject when stimulus checks are on the line. One source told Fox Business Network that the amount would start to reduce for those making $75,000 and above -- and the checks would be limited to those who make $99,000 or less. “This is something we want to do right away,” McConnell said on the floor. “This is not an ordinary policy, but this is not an ordinary time.” He added: “The American people need help and they need it fast. This will deliver it.” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday morning told Fox Business Network that the White House is looking at payments of $1,000 to most adult Americans within three weeks, and an additional $500 for children. A family of four would receive as much as $3,000. Mnuchin also said that if the crisis were still ongoing in six weeks, the federal government would deliver another round of checks worth the same amount of money. But sources familiar with the negotiations between Congress and the Treasury Department later told FBN on Thursday that the Senate is now looking to deliver more than that per person. Sources said that senators are weighing delivering $1,200 per adult in the U.S. in two payments, and an additional $500 for children. Negotiations, though, are ongoing. SENATE DEMS PROPOSE SUSPENDING FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS AMID CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK Mnuchin said earlier this week that it was “clear we don’t need to send people who make a million dollars a year checks.” Meanwhile, McConnell’s new proposal also includes relief and support for small businesses, and would provide “new federally guaranteed loans” that he said would “address immediate cash flow problems.” McConnell also said that the Senate was working to let “qualified” small businesses get liquidity through “familiar institutions” like their community banks. He added that the relief for small businesses would help them to “endure, help workers keep their jobs, and businesses and workers emerge from this ready to thrive.” The Senate is also looking at implementing “targeted lending” to industries of national importance, like the airline industry. “We’re not talking about so-called bailouts for firms that made reckless decisions,” McConnell said, referencing the 2008 financial crisis. “No one is alleging a moral hazard here.” “None of these firms, not corner stores, pizza parlors, not airlines, brought this on themselves,"" he continued. “We’re not talking about a taxpayer-funded cushion for companies that made mistakes. We’re talking about loans that must be repaid.” McConnell also said the new proposal would give more resources to those in the medical field and healthcare industry, and would “remove barriers to care, speed innovation, fund hospitals and health centers to treat patients and expand health care workers access to the tools they need.” Meanwhile, President Trump on Wednesday signed the second coronavirus relief bill into law that provides paid sick leave, unemployment help and free testing to Americans. The legislation provides 14 days of paid sick days to workers affected by the coronavirus, ensures free testing to everyone, including the uninsured, and expands food aid and boosts unemployment dollars to states. The House and Senate already passed a bipartisan $8.3 billion package to prop up the health care system to prepare for the influx of sick Americans. The second response bill that was signed into law Wednesday aims to bring relief to workers who lost their jobs and families at home for illnesses, quarantines or caring for kids whose schools have shuttered. As of Thursday afternoon, the U.S. had more than 10,700 confirmed cases of coronavirus in all 50 states, including Washington, D.C. The U.S., so far, has seen 154 COVID-19-related deaths. The Trump administration’s task force predicted Tuesday that the number of cases in the U.S. could peak in about 45 days.

"                          Senator Chris Coons comments on the two members of Congress who tested positive for coronavirus and how Congress is functioning remotely Members of both the House of Representatives and the Senate are pushing to allow Congress to vote remotely as leaders work feverishly to hash out an agreement for a massive coronavirus relief bill and after two colleagues tested positive for the novel coronavirus Wednesday. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, on Thursday introduced a resolution to amend the chamber's rules to allow for remote voting in emergencies. Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., also said in a letter to Democratic members that he expected the House to ""adjust our voting procedures"" in order to follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations limiting the number of people in any one gathering. ""I joined with Sen. Portman of Ohio in proposing that we take into consideration the fact that we have critically important work to do in the Senate,"" Durbin said in floor remarks Thursday. ""But gathering in groups, as we've done historically, poses a health risk not just to us as members and our families, but to the staff as well as their families."" CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW TRUMP ANNOUNCES FDA MAKING ANTI-MALARIA DRUG AVAILABLE 'ALMOST IMMEDIATELY' TO TACKLE CORONAVIRUS He continued: ""Why is it required that we be physically present on the floor closer to one another than perhaps we should be at this moment of a public health crisis?"" The resolution introduced by Portman and Durbin would allow the Senate majority leader and the minority leader – currently Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. – to agree to allow ""secure remote voting"" in an emergency. The Senate would then be able to vote every 30 days to continue to allow remote voting. ""In times of a national emergency, the Senate must be able to convene and act expeditiously even if we can’t be together in person,"" Portman said in a statement. ""While I know there is resistance to changing a Senate tradition to allow for remote voting during national emergencies, I believe this is an important issue and worthy of robust discussion among our Senate colleagues."" Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., and Rep. Ben McAdams, D-Utah, on Wednesday were the first two members of Congress to announce they tested positive. CHINA RECASTS ITSELF AS GLOBAL CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE LEADER AS US, EU STRUGGLE McConnell, an old-fashioned Senate parliamentarian, panned the idea of remote voting Tuesday, saying he would work to keep senators from spreading the coronavirus among each other ""without fundamentally changing Senate rules."" The Senate majority leader said one of the ways this could be accomplished is by extending the amount of time each vote lasts, thus allowing senators to space out their time in the chamber and maintain social distancing. It is also unclear how ""secure"" remote voting from members of Congress would work under Durbin and Portman's proposal. In floor remarks Thursday, Portman also cited constitutional concerns as a reason why he thought the Senate should allow for remote voting. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""It's important to me, and I think to all of my colleagues, that Article I be heard, that the legislative branch be heard, that we have the ability to convene for the continuity of government and not allow what we would normally do perhaps to shift over ... to the executive branch or not to be addressed at all,"" he said. Durbin, citing evolving national security threats worldwide, said it may be inevitable that the Senate figure out a way to have members vote remotely. ""We live in an age where national emergencies, public health crises and terrorism can threaten the ordinary course of Senate business,"" he said in a statement. ""We need to bring voting in the Senate into the 21st century so that our important work can continue even under extraordinary circumstances. Bob Dylan was right: ‘the times they are a-changin'.'""

"                          Shelter-in-place restrictions are rapidly expanding in California, affecting over 10 million residents; Claudia Cowan reports from San Francisco. The coronavirus outbreak has resulted in federal, state and local officials declaring a state of emergency, which allows them to wield additional powers in an effort to protect residents and curb the severity of the outbreak. The result has been varying degrees of life-disrupting events such as quarantines, shuttered businesses and school closures -- which raises a multitude of questions about what the government legally can and cannot do. GOV. DESANTIS TO FLORIDA SPRING BREAKERS: 'THE PARTY'S OVER' Federal emergency powers The federal government is relatively limited in what it can do to control people’s daily lives, as “police power” such as measures aimed at promoting public safety is generally reserved for the states. What Washington can do is impose certain travel restrictions and border protections and issue warnings to avoid travel to certain areas. The Secretary of Health and Human Services also has the ability to declare a Public Health Emergency, which Secretary Alex Azar has done. In the case of a PHE, the government takes on powers related to “making grants; entering into contracts; and conducting and supporting investigations into the cause, treatment, or prevention of the disease or disorder,” according to an HHS website for Public Health Emergency. States of emergency last for the duration of the emergency or 90 days, and can be extended by the secretary. Congress needs to be notified within 48 hours of a declaration, and other agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security, Justice Department and the FBI have to be kept informed. 'THE VIEW' HOSTS DEFEND TRUMP'S DESCRIPTION OF HIMSELF AS A 'WARTIME' PRESIDENT DURING PANDEMIC The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) can also take certain steps under the Public Health Services Act. This includes imposing quarantines, like they did in the case of 200 people who were evacuated from Wuhan, China, and others who had been on cruise ships. The CDC can also isolate and examine individuals who they suspect or know to be infected. As Arizona State University Law professor James G. Hodge, Jr., wrote for the Network for Public Health Law, while the federal government can quarantine individuals or groups suspected of being infected by coronavirus, they cannot enforce broad lockdowns of groups in “hot zones.” The government can make medical triage decisions based on scientific recommendations, but not based on factors such as race, religion, nationality, or ability to pay. Even individuals cannot be isolated without confirmation of infections. Individuals also have due process rights, meaning they cannot be subjected to forced treatment. President Trump has also invoked two laws that enhance the federal government’s ability to respond to the crisis. The Stafford Act allows the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to utilize government programs to provide assistance to local governments. The Defense Production Act, which Trump said he has invoked in case of ""a worst case scenario,"" requires companies to accept and prioritize contracts from the government and to prioritize “materials, services, and facilities to promote the national defense or to maximize domestic energy supplies.” While this provision has historically been used to ramp up military production, in the midst of the COVID19 pandemic the act will be used for medical supplies. One thing that the president cannot do is delay November’s presidential election. While numerous states have laws allowing them to put off their own elections, and Congress reserves the power to change the time of a federal election, the executive branch has no say over these matters. States and local actions Going back to states’ police power, this is the basis for measures currently being taken in places like New York and California, where daily life has been dramatically altered. Governors can impose restrictions statewide, while mayors have the ability to put in place additional measures at the local level. San Francisco, for example, has imposed a “shelter in place” lockdown, meaning people must remain at home except for tasks such as grocery shopping, getting medical treatment, caring for other people, and exercising. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has said he is considering imposing similar restrictions, although Gov. Andrew Cuomo stated Thursday that there is currently no plan for this to happen. He did, however, call for 75 percent of the ""nonessential"" workforce to work from home. New York City has already seen the closures of establishments such as concert venues and bars that do not serve food, with restaurants restricted to takeout and delivery only -- restrictions being imposed in jurisdictions across the country. This was followed by restrictions across the tri-state area of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, which include 8 p.m. curfews, and the closure of all schools, gyms, movie theaters, and casinos. This does not count those run by Native American tribes, although the Oneida Indian Nation stated they would be closing casinos. Additional restrictions that New York law permits in a state of emergency include “the suspension or limitation of the sale, dispensing, use or transportation of alcoholic beverages, firearms, explosives, and flammable materials and liquids” and the establishment of emergency shelters and medical shelters. EATING TAKEOUT AND DINING IN: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW DURING THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC California has also closed bars and nightclubs in the state. Like New York, the states of Massachusetts, Ohio and Illinois have limited bars and restaurants to takeout and delivery only. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker has also restricted gatherings to only permit those of 25 people or less. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot ordered Thursday that all sick people remain home. Texas also declared a shutdown that will close bars, restaurants, gyms and schools from Friday until April 1. Florida also saw a range of responses from state and local officials. Cocoa Beach Mayor Ben Malik announced that the city would be shutting down parking to dissuade people from going to the beach. On Thursday, Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez announced that all parks and beaches in the county will be closed. Since then, Gov. Ron DeSantis said on “Fox & Friends” that “the party’s over in Florida” for spring breakers who were still looking to party at the shore despite the outbreak, and beaches will either close or abide by federal guidelines limiting crowds. Enforcement and limitations Enforcement and penalties for violating restrictions can vary significantly from state to state. According to a survey by Law & Crime’s Aaron Keller and Elura Nanos, violations of quarantines in New Jersey and Montana can be punished by fines of between $10 and $100. In Mississippi, someone who “knowingly and willfully violates” a quarantine order can be fined up to $5,000 and be imprisoned for up to five years. Despite their broad authorities, there are limitations on prohibitions states can put in place. In New York, a state of emergency only lasts for 30 days or until the proclamation is rescinded, whichever is sooner. A state of emergency can, however, be extended by additional 30-day periods. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In California, emergency regulations remain in effect for 180 days, unless the state’s Office of Administrative Law approves a readoption, which can only be done twice, and each readoption period is just 90 days.

"                          The number of people testing positive for coronavirus has spiked after testing has become more readily available in the U.S. President Trump and Gov. Cuomo are just two officials considering how to address this issue. Kansas GOP lawmakers on Wednesday moved to limit their Democratic governor’s emergency powers during the coronavirus pandemic, arguing that they are an overreaction that is fueling panic and an unnecessary intrusion into people’s lives.  The pushback came after Gov. Laura Kelly announced Tuesday that all public schools will be closed for the remainder of the school year and classes will be held remotely to curb the spread of the coronavirus.        Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly answers questions from reporters after announcing that she'd order all public and private K-12 schools in the state to close for the rest of the semester, Tuesday, March 17, 2020, at the Statehouse in Topeka, Kan.      (AP) Conservative critics have suggested that Kelly's actions suggest she might go after firearms and try to limit their sale. Kelly declared a state of emergency last week to mobilize state resources, but it will expire March 27 unless legislators pass a resolution extending it. Lawmakers are now set to have the GOP-controlled legislature's leaders scrutinize all of Kelly's future coronavirus orders and to give them the power to revoke many of them within days.  ""There is a concern about civil liberties, a concern about the proper exercise of government authority and not wanting it to be too extreme,” House Speaker Pro Tem. Blaine Finch, who helped draft the final version, told fellow Republicans. The House approved a version of the resolution last week as a straightforward extension of Kelly's state of emergency into January 2021.  CURFEWS, CLOSURES AND MORE: WHAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN AND CAN'T DO IN A HEALTH EMERGENCY The Senate on Wednesday passed its version limiting Kelly's power, 37-2. The two chambers then negotiated a compromise Wednesday night, with final votes in both chambers expected later Thursday. The state of emergency would last until May 1, but legislative leaders could approve further extensions every 30 days. The Senate-approved language from conservatives to strip Kelly of power governors have had in other emergencies. Among those powers is the authority to say who goes into or out of a disaster area and to restrict movement within an area. She also would lose the governor's broad power to act to ""promote and secure the safety and protection of the civilian population."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Conservatives argued that Kelly's bold moves, and similar actions in other states, are unnecessarily torpedoing the economy and isolating people.  Democrats warned that the Senate's language could limit Kelly's ability to set up quarantine zones around communities in crisis.

"                          Schools close, sports leagues suspend or delay their seasons and large public gatherings are limited in response to the coronavirus pandemic; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' The State Department advised United States citizens on Thursday to avoid all international travel due to the outbreak of coronavirus around the globe, urging Americans abroad to arrange for an “immediate return” to the U.S. unless they plan to stay out of the country for “an indefinite period.” Fox News reported early Thursday that the State Department would raise its global travel advisory to a Level 4, “Do Not Travel,” which is the most severe warning on State’s advisory scale. The department made it official later in the afternoon. “The Department of State advises U.S. citizens to avoid all international travel due to the global impact of COVID-19,” the State Department said in a statement. “In countries where commercial departure options remain available, U.S. citizens who live in the United States should arrange for immediate return to the United States, unless they are prepared to remain abroad for an indefinite period.” The State Department also warned that U.S. citizens living abroad “should avoid all international travel.” “Many countries are experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks and implementing travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines, closing borders, and prohibiting non-citizens from entry with little advance notice,” the State Department said. “Airlines have cancelled many international flights and several cruise operators have suspended operations or cancelled trips.” The department added: “If you choose to travel internationally, your travel plans may be severely disrupted, and you may be forced to remain outside of the United States for an indefinite timeframe.” ENERGY DEPARTMENT BUYING MILLIONS OF BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL TO FILL STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE The State Department, before the outbreak of COVID-19 around the globe, had reserved Level 4 for Libya, North Korea, Afghanistan, Somalia, Syria, Burkina Faso, South Sudan, Yemen, Venezuela, Central African Republic, Mali, Iran, Iraq and Haiti. State also had designated parts of countries Level 4, like Sinaloa state in Mexico, due to cartel violence, or areas of southern and eastern Turkey due to terrorism and war. The move comes after the department had implemented a global Level 3 advisory over the weekend, which warned Americans to reconsider traveling abroad. Last week, the State Department authorized the departure of U.S. personnel and family members from any diplomatic or consular post in the world who ""have determined they are at higher risk of a poor outcome if exposed to COVID-19 or who have requested departure based on a commensurate justification.""  The department said Thursday that ""these departures may limit the ability of U.S. Embassies and consulates to provide services to U.S. citizens."" The World Health Organization designated COVID-19 a global pandemic last week. TRUMP TO EXTEND EUROPEAN TRAVEL BAN TO INCLUDE UK, IRELAND AMID CORONAVIRUS  Following that designation, President Trump announced a temporary halt on air travel to the United States from Europe, initially excluding flights from the United Kingdom and those carrying cargo, in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. Trump then declared a national emergency over the outbreak and moved to ban travel from the U.K. as well. This week, the president and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also agreed to largely close the U.S.-Canada border to curb the spread of the virus. As of Thursday, the U.S. currently has 11,274 confirmed cases of coronavirus in all 50 states, including Washington, D.C. The U.S., so far, has seen 157 COVID-19-related deaths. The Trump administration’s task force predicted Tuesday that the number of cases in the U.S. could peak in about 45 days.

"                          California’s over 151,000 homeless people are being moved into hotels to prevent the spread of the coronavirus on the street. California Gov. Gavin Newsom authorized on Wednesday the spending of $150 million in emergency funding to protect homeless individuals amid the coronavirus pandemic. Newsom, a Democrat, directed that $100 million will go to local governments for shelter support and emergency housing, while the remaining money will be used to buy trailers and lease hotel and motel rooms to serve as quarantine sites for any homeless individuals who have become infected with the contagion. “People experiencing homelessness are among the most vulnerable to the spread of COVID-19,” Newsom said. “California is deploying massive resources to get these vulnerable residents safely into shelter, removing regulatory barriers and securing trailers and hotels to provide immediate housing options for those most at risk."" He added: “Helping these residents is critical to protecting public health, flattening the curve and slowing the spread of COVID-19.” PHOTOS: EMPTY STREETS AMID CORONAVIRUS FEARS IN US CITIES Along with the allocation of millions of dollars, the state has also permitted local municipalities to freely spend money allocated to battle homelessness on combating the spread of the virus among the community, ramped up public health outreach among the homeless, and opened two hotels it has leased to house homeless individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19. California is home to half of the country’s street homeless population – and more than one-fifth of the reported cases of coronavirus nationwide so far – and state and local lawmakers have already thrown billions of dollars trying to tackle the mounting issue of homelessness. The coronavirus pandemic adds another – possibly deadly – angle to the issue. The stress and physical toll of living on the streets paired with the poor sanitary conditions faced by the homeless make them particularly susceptible to diseases and viruses. In addition, many homeless people deal with mental health and substance abuse issues and are generally wary of local authorities, meaning they are hesitant to seek help when they do get sick.

Sign up here.**On the roster: Some political coronavirus questions to consider - I’ll Tell You What: Bernie double or nothing - Pelosi holds tight grip on next stimulus plan - Trump to have call with nation’s governors - To your health SOME POLITICAL CORONAVIRUS QUESTIONS TO CONSIDERMaybe first of all, we should remember that it’s only been a week that most people have really been living differently.The electorate has barely begun to digest the most dramatic change in how Americans live and work since at least Sept. 11, 2001. We are still at the very front end of things.So before you start making guesses about November, just consider that almost no sane person would have predicted eight months ago anything like the events of the past seven days.Last July would you have gone with, “Joe Biden declared the Democratic nominee by acclamation in mid-March after the remaining primaries have been indefinitely scrapped because of a public health emergency?” We’d buy a whole raft of Boston coolers (at a reasonable social distance) for the man or woman who picked that particular square on the political tipboard.We’ve only been having even a minor national discussion about coronavirus and contagion for less than two months, about the time that the administration in relatively modest tones announced a public health emergency to shut off travel from China.It was only three weeks ago that President Trump was completely blowing off the idea of mass infection. There would, he said, be fewer than 15 cases by the end of February, “down to close to zero.”The first death in the U.S. was a nursing home in the Seattle suburbs on Leap Day. In the following two weeks, world markets started to buckle under the pressures of disrupted international commerce and what was increasingly an absolute shutdown of Europe.But while there were certainly early American adopters on coronavirus closures, it was only after the president gave his speech last Wednesday that things really got wild.Having watched him heave his way through that one – and the White House hazmat fact-check mop up after – institutional leaders of the corporate, academic and cultural kinds realized that the federal cavalry was still trying to get astride its mounts.That’s what, in part, gave us the two historic days that followed. Without a clear message from the public sector, the privates took command. Human resources and risk management executives from Miami to Seattle started implementing the protocols that they have been obediently writing, re-writing and improving for decades – while being studiously ignored by most of their colleagues.Regular America was not prepared for compliance. It went down hard.In a WSJ/NBC News survey taken between Wednesday and Friday of last week, 78 percent of respondents said that the virus had changed their lives either not at all or in “only a small way.” What do you think those numbers would look like today, one week later?Whatever they took away from Trump’s speech, the shared sentiment seems to have been with the president’s hot mic moment before he began.When the National Collegiate Athletic Association closes March Madness at a cost to itself (and the scholarship money it pays out) of nearly a billion dollars after its massive insurance policy, you know the sauerkraut is getting pretty sticky – and everybody did know it. That’s the kind of institution that still has extra-governmental powers, even in this frayed society. When the NCAA and its peers like Disney theme parks, Little League baseball and the dense network of professional associations and organizations that shut down gatherings, social pressure for precautions intensified throughout the day Friday and into the weekend.Americans, many of whom had been skeptical just days before, jumped into action.The churches that closed their doors Sunday, the families that took a loved one in trouble to safety and the supervisors who stayed all night so that their crews could go home have probably done far more to prevent losses from this epidemic than anything the federal government will ever do.By Monday, the shutdown wave was just climbing toward its apogee. On Wednesday, they shuttered the auto plants.The word from governmental entities up and down the line was, ahem, uneven as leaders tried to catch up.As a note of Appalachian origins, we’d like to thank West Virginia’s governor, Jim Justice, for being extremely on brand with his misguided Monday encouragement to the Mountain State and its fourth-oldest population in the nation that, “if you want to go to Bob Evans and eat, go to Bob Evans and eat.”But in this time of panic, not even the crispy deliciousness of country-fried steak in sawmill gravy was exempt. Justice ordered all the restaurants in the state close for sit-down service the next day.Now, a week and a day after the Oval Office speech, America and its leaders are very different. Trump has gone from aggressive virus minimizer to self-described “wartime president.” Democrats are trying to sound supportive (if only grudgingly so). And voters are stuck at home contemplating collapsed retirement funds and wondering what fresh freak-out is next.So it’s safe to say that we don’t know much, if anything, about the medium-term political consequences here. We wouldn’t even feel much confidence talking about the short term.But we do have questions.The biggest being: How long will these massive shutdowns go on? That, of course, depends on how successful the shutdown will be at minimizing the spread of the illness.Will this be like the 1979-80 energy crisis was for Jimmy Carter or will it be, as Trump hopes, an opportunity to wield wartime powers and enjoy wartime national unity?Will Democrats be able to hold a convention at all? Will the disrupted nomination process deprive Joe Biden of the traditional “win bonus?” Can Biden even scratch his way into the national discussion?Will the smothered economy and imploded financial markets starve campaigns of cash as donors cinch their purse strings?Will state election officials conclude that mail-in voting is the only prudent course as they prepare ballots this summer, especially if there are serious concerns about an autumn flare up? What does that do to voter participation?Will Trump be long deprived of his mass rallies, the centerpiece of his re-election campaign?Will this be like the other crises of our young century and increase the national appetite for governmental intervention or will this further erode confidence in government to the point that large-scale programs become unappealing?Once we start getting some answers to these, then we can get back in the business of forecasting. Until then, we’ll be watching and waiting.THE RULEBOOK: SHOCKER “IT IS not a little remarkable that in every case reported by ancient history, in which government has been established with deliberation and consent, the task of framing it has not been committed to an assembly of men, but has been performed by some individual citizen of preeminent wisdom and approved integrity.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 38TIME OUT: VIVA LAS VEGASHistory: “In an attempt to lift the state out of the hard times of the Great Depression, [on this day in 1931] the Nevada state legislature votes to legalize gambling. Located in the Great Basin desert, few settlers chose to live in Nevada after the United States acquired the territory at the end of the Mexican War in 1848. … [In 1864] during the Civil War, Nevada was hastily made the 36th state in order to strengthen the Union. At the beginning of the Depression, Nevada’s mines were in decline, and its economy was in shambles. In March 1931, Nevada’s state legislature responded to population flight by taking the drastic measure of legalizing gambling and, later in the year, divorce. Established in 1905, Las Vegas, Nevada, has since become the gambling and entertainment capital of the world… In the first few decades after the legalization of gambling, organized crime flourished in Las Vegas. Today, state gambling taxes account for the lion’s share of Nevada’s overall tax revenues.”Flag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARDESTIMATED DELEGATES FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATIONBiden: 1181Sanders: 885[Ed. note: 1,991 delegates needed to win]TRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE Average approval: 43.8 percentAverage disapproval: 51.8 percentNet Score: -8 percentChange from one week ago: ↑ 0.4 points[Average includes: NPR/PBS News/Marist: 43% approve - 50% disapprove; NBC News/WSJ: 46% approve - 51% disapprove; Gallup: 44% approve - 52% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 41% approve - 54% disapprove; CNN: 45% approve - 52% disapprove.]WANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT? You can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

LISTEN AND SUBSCRIBE HEREPELOSI HOLDS TIGHT GRIP ON NEXT STIMULUS PLANPolitico: “House Democrats are drafting a new stimulus bill to address the coronavirus pandemic — legislation designed as their counter-offer to a trillion-dollar package currently being assembled in the Republican-controlled Senate. On a private call Wednesday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi directed her leadership team and committee chairs to begin further efforts to address the looming economic disaster caused by the growing coronavirus crisis. The House Democratic plan will incorporate proposals from several panels and is expected to include additional unemployment insurance payments, expanded Medicaid coverage, an airline rescue package, relief for homeowners and renters, support for small businesses, and additional food security measures, according to Democratic lawmakers and aides. … Each House committee will submit their own plans to Pelosi, who will compile a large-scale relief package in the coming days. Pelosi and her top deputies plan to review the ideas with Democrats — who are working from their districts this week — on a conference call Thursday afternoon.”Mnuchin: Coronavirus stimulus plan could deliver $3K to family of four - Roll Call: “The emerging $1 trillion aid package intended to help weather the COVID-19 economic storm appears likely to deliver $1,000 to every U.S. adult, plus $500 per child, according to Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and a GOP senator involved in the drafting. ‘So for a family of four, that's a $3,000 payment,’ Mnuchin told Fox Business on Thursday morning, adding that he thinks the checks would be sent within three weeks of enactment. ‘That may change in negotiations with Democrats, but that’s the priority right now,’ Mitt Romney of Utah said on the Hugh Hewitt radio show, confirming the basic structure of the plan under discussion. Mnuchin said a second round of checks in the same amount would go out six weeks later if economic conditions haven't improved and the ‘national emergency’ Trump declared last week is still in effect. Mnuchin said most households wouldn't have to worry about venturing outside to the bank to cash their checks and risk virus exposure: ‘It's really money direct-deposited, most people.’”Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart, Ben McAdams first lawmakers to test positive - Fox News: “Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., on Wednesday became the first member of Congress to announce that he has tested positive for coronavirus, saying he had been stricken with a fever and headache this weekend. Shortly afterward, Rep. Ben McAdams, D-Utah, said he too had tested positive after developing ‘mild cold-like symptoms’ Sunday evening. The 45-year-old told constituents he first learned the test result Wednesday. As the news broke, Republican whip Steve Scalise, R-La., issued a statement announcing he would go into quarantine, although he said he did not currently have any symptoms. … Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Mo., said she would also self-quarantine, although she had no symptoms, because last week she ‘participated in a small group meeting with a colleague who has since tested positive for COVID-19.’”The Judge’s Ruling: Freedom in a Time of Madness - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano explains Coronavirus fear, our freedom and the Constitution: “The Contracts Clause of the Constitution prohibits the states from interfering with lawful contracts, such as leases and employment agreements. And the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the states from interfering with life, liberty or property without a trial at which the state must prove fault. The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment requires just compensation when the state meaningfully interferes with an owner’s chosen lawful use of his property. Taken together, these clauses reveal the significant protections of private property in the Constitution itself. … Why is this happening? Throughout history, free people have been willing to accept the devil's bargain of trading liberty for safety when they are fearful. We supinely accept the shallow and hollow offers of government that somehow less liberty equals more safety.” More here.TRUMP TO HAVE CALL WITH NATION’S GOVERNORS Politico: “The nation’s governors are going to be talking to President Donald Trump and VP Mike Pence today at 2 p.m. here are the five things they are going to ask from Trump and the federal government: 1) They want the government to dedicate at least half of the supplemental funding directly to states and for the W.H. to provide quick action on waiver requests. 2) They want increased access to personal protective equipment, masks, test kits, extraction kits and to quicken the production of life-saving equipment like ventilators. 3) Support Title 32 -- which allows governors to call National Guardsmen to active duty, with the approval of the president. 4) They want guidance on the implementation of the Defense Production Act -- they want to know what the administration is prioritizing. 5) Allow more time for completion of the Census and REAL ID.”Trump: FDA making anti-malaria drug available for virus - Fox News: “President Trump announced Thursday that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is making experimental drugs -- including those used for treating malaria -- available as part of the ongoing effort to tackle the spread of the coronavirus. Trump announced at a White House press briefing that chloroquine, a drug designed for use in malaria, has been FDA approved and will be made available by prescription ‘almost immediately.’ He said it was one of a number of antiviral therapies to limit the symptoms of the virus that the administration is trying to get to Americans as quickly as possible. … Addressing potential safety concerns, Trump noted that it had been used previously in treating malaria, ‘so we know if things don't go as planned, it’s not going to kill anybody.’ He said it had shown ‘very encouraging’ early results. He also said another drug, remdesivir, would be made available to Americans as well by the process of ‘compassionate use.’ He said it would remain to be seen whether it would help combat the crisis.”PLAY-BY-PLAYSanders to head home to Vermont, will reassess campaign - WaPoTulsi Gabbard suspends long-shot campaign, endorses Biden - Fox NewsBill Weld drops quixotic primary bid against Trump - NYTWhen it comes to Election Day in November, only Congress can change the date - WSJReport: State Department moves toward advising against all international travel - Fox NewsAUDIBLE: SAME THOUGH“Will work for donuts.” – The phrase on the t-shirt Jeb Bush sported in a video about social distancing with his granddaughter, per the NYT.FROM THE BLEACHERS“I took note of the comment by Mr. Jim Hain [in Wednesday’s Halftime Report] concerning preparations for the lean times.

Last week, Melissa and Lee Katrincic, owners of Durham Distillery, which makes Conniption Gin … [wanted to help their community.] The answer was close by. Durham Distillery has an active permit with the state-run Alcohol Beverage Control commission (ABC), which allows the couple’s company to buy corn-based ethanol at 95% alcohol by volume. That permit, coupled with Lee Katrincic’s experience from his twenty-four-year tenure as a pharmaceutical chemist, gave the company both the ability and the means to create the cleaner earlier this week. Mixing their ethanol with distilled water brings the solution down to 70% alcohol by volume, matching levels recommended for sanitizing solutions by the Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization. So instead of producing gin, the distillery has temporarily switched focus to producing their cleaning solution.”AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES…“The arguments for and against the filibuster are so well-known to both parties as to be practically memorized.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on April 6, 2017.Chris Stirewalt is the politics editor for Fox News. Brianna McClelland contributed to this report.

"                          Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell provides updates on the coronavirus funding bill. Saying lawmakers ""need to take bold and swift action as soon as possible,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday introduced legislation to provide as much as $1,200 per person and $2,400 per couple in the U.S. amid the coronavirus outbreak and skyrocketing jobless claims. The draft legislation, obtained by Fox News, would provide minimum payments of $600, and aid would be phased down at adjusted gross income thresholds of $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 per couple. Additionally, there would be $500 payments for each child. The rebate amount is slated to then be reduced by $5 for each $100 a taxpayer’s income exceeds the legislation's threshold. The amount is therefore reduced to zero for single taxpayers with incomes exceeding $99,000 and $198,000 for joint filers. The IRS would determine income based on taxpayers' 2018 tax returns, or 2019 tax returns in cases where there is no 2018 return -- a provision that The Federalist's Sean Davis called ""idiotic,"" given that many ""jobs or businesses disappeared within the last month."" Qualifying income includes earned income, as well as Social Security retirement benefits and certain compensation and pension benefits paid to veterans. This approach ""ensures relief gets to low-income seniors and disabled veterans"" as well, top Republicans said in their summary of the legislation. READ MCCONNELL'S STIMULUS PROPOSAL And, similar to previous disaster-related relief provisions, the bill would ""waive the 10-percent early withdrawal penalty for distributions up to $100,000 from qualified retirement accounts for coronavirus-related purposes."" McConnell's proposal aligns with the Trump administration's push to swiftly send checks to U.S. citizens. The legislation additionally contains numerous provisions geared at helping small businesses, including a delay of payment for employer payroll taxes, a delay of estimated tax payments for corporations, and modifications for net operating losses.

Phillip)       McConnell's plan would provide $208 billion in loans and loan guarantees to distressed sectors of the economy, including $50 billion for commercial airlines and $8 billion for air cargo carriers, and $150 billion for other eligible businesses, but those loans would have to be paid back. It's an opening salvo in fast-track talks with Democrats as President Trump urges Congress to “go big” to respond as Americans reel from the crisis. McConnell, R-Ky., speaking on the Senate floor, said he wanted key Republicans to meet with Democrats on the relief bill, known as S.3548, Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (Phase III). READ REPUBLICANS' SECTION-BY-SECTION SUMMARY OF THE BILL ""These are urgent discussions and they need to happen at the member level,"" McConnell said, noting the White House will send key personnel to talk about the bill as they try to forge a compromise. Fox News is told McConnell did not yet have the votes on his side, and that the situation was complicated by the fact that two Republicans have self-quarantined. The GOP holds a slim 53-47 majority in the Senate, with Vice President Mike Pence the possible tiebreaking vote. Speaking after McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., complained that Republicans had sought ""no input"" from Democrats, and asserted that no Democrats had even seen the bill. He added he was told ""there is a bailout for industries"" in the measure. ""The number one priority is addressing this health crisis, which requires a Marshall Plan to rebuild our health care infrastructure on a continental scale and ensure the resources are there to test and treat everyone who needs it,"" Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a joint statement. “To earn Democratic support in the Congress, any economic stimulus proposal must include new, strong and strict provisions that prioritize and protect workers, such as banning the recipient companies from buying back stock, rewarding executives, and laying off workers,"" they added. “We look forward to working in a bipartisan way to deliver for the American people as soon as humanly possible.” ILHAN OMAR PRAISES TRUMP'S 'INCREDIBLE' CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE Even some of McConnell's GOP senators have said they preferred instead to use the federal dollars to keep workers who are asked to stay home on the business payrolls. “What I want is income, not one check,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., summing up the views of some exiting a long, private meeting of GOP senators on Capitol Hill. One or two checks “makes no sense to me,” he said. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday morning told Fox Business Network that the White House was looking at payments of $1,000 to most adult Americans within three weeks, as a way to stem the widespread economic damage caused by shuttered businesses and social distancing.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)       Mnuchin also said that if the crisis were still ongoing in six weeks, the federal government would deliver another round of checks worth the same amount of money. The Treasury secretary said Thursday the checks would be direct-deposited into people’s accounts. Though unusual, stimulus checks are not unprecedented. Former President George W. Bush's administration twice successfully pushed for economic stimulus checks. Meanwhile, President Trump on Wednesday signed the second coronavirus relief bill into law that provides paid sick leave, unemployment help and free testing to Americans. INSIDE CHINA'S PROPAGANDA PUSH ON CORONAVIRUS The legislation provides 14 days of paid sick days to workers affected by the coronavirus, ensures free testing to everyone, including the uninsured, and expands food aid and boosts unemployment dollars to states. The House and Senate already passed a bipartisan $8.3 billion package to prop up the health care system to prepare for the influx of sick Americans. The second response bill that was signed into law Wednesday aims to bring relief to workers who lost their jobs and families at home for illnesses, quarantines or caring for kids whose schools have shuttered. Fox News' Chad Pergram, Brooke Singman, Mike Emanuel, and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

"                          Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Businesswoman Marie Newman and her pro-choice allies ousted Rep. Dan Lipinski, D-Ill., an eight-term, pro-life incumbent on Tuesday, and in doing so, ignited accusations that the Democratic Party had solidified a hostile apparatus for members who oppose abortion. The narrow loss for Lipinski marked the end of an era in which his father -- another pro-life Democrat -- held that seat since 1983. The younger Lipinski’s loss came as the abortion debate intensified with national and state-level laws bringing an already hot-button issue to the forefront of political battles. AOC’S PICK IN DEMOCRAT PRIMARY FOR HOUSE SEAT BEATS INCUMBENT Planned Parenthood Votes, a political project of the nation’s largest abortion provider, recently announced its most ambitious electoral effort to date with $45 million in spending nationwide. That included funding for a $1.4 million initiative -- comprising direct mail and digital and television ad buys -- it and other pro-choice groups led, creating what pro-life leaders are describing as an onslaught of negative ads against Lipinski.       Rep. Dan Lipinski, D-Ill., an eight-term, pro-life incumbent on Tuesday, was ousted in a Democratic primary on Tuesday.      (Reuters/Kamil Krzacznski) ""I think they can claim it,"" Marjorie Dannenfelser, head of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, told Fox News when asked about the impact of groups like NARAL and Planned Parenthood Votes on Tuesday’s election. In his concession speech, Lipinski similarly argued that pro-choice groups beat him by capitalizing on his anti-abortion background -- which was also present when he beat Newman in 2018. MEET THE PRO-LIFE DEMOCRAT BEHIND ONE OF THE SUPREME COURT'S MOST CONTROVERSIAL CASES FOR 2020 In the days after Tuesday’s primary, it’s unclear what exactly drove voters to the polls. Lipinski, whose team touted his support among older voters, could have lost needed turnout due to social distancing guidance surrounding the coronavirus. Planned Parenthood Votes, however, maintains that Lipinski’s record was a major factor in his loss, and that its status as a trusted third-party helped validate Illinois voters’ opposition to abortion regulations. The group said its internal polling -- conducted in conjunction with EMILY's List, NARAL, SEIU, and other organizations -- showed a majority (62 percent) of Lipinski’s residents saying they were less likely to vote for him after learning about his anti-abortion views (opposing abortion access, voting to defund Planned Parenthood, and receiving money from pro-life groups). They also point to national polls showing support for Roe v. Wade -- the landmark Supreme Court decision blocking certain state-level abortion restrictions. It’s unclear whether those polls asked about specific restrictions on abortion, but pro-life groups say voters were closer to Lipinski than the rest of his party on those particulars. In-person surveys administered by Students for Life showed about 70 percent of Lipinski’s residents overwhelmingly opposing taxpayer funding for abortion and favoring restrictions on the procedure after five months. After Newman’s 2018 loss, she out-fundraised Lipinski in a political climate increasingly dominated by concerns about health care and abortion. The stakes have “never” been higher, Planned Parenthood Votes executive director Jenny Lawson previously said. PLANNED PARENTHOOD LAUNCHES 2020 INITIATIVE WITH ENDORSEMENTS, FIVE-FIGURE AD BUY Lipinski opposed recent efforts to weaken Obamacare but initially opposed the law partially due to abortion-related provisions. That was a “watershed moment,” according to Dannenfelser, who said Obama “helped crystallize complete polarization of the issue.” Dannenfelser previously worked for a pro-life Democrat in Congress and directed the pro-life caucus. Derrick Jones, the chief marketing officer for the National Right to Life Committee, charged that Tuesday’s results reflected the culmination of the party’s decadeslong drift towards extremism on the issue. Lipinski’s primary loss was particularly symbolic since he co-chairs the pro-life caucus, said Jones, whose organization sent pro-Lipinski mailers in his district. Around Democrats for Life’s founding in the late 1990s, the group listed more than 40 pro-life Democrats in Congress. Today, the number is much smaller and a far cry from the majorities Danenfelser says she fought to build in the late 80s. For example, only three Democrats, including Lipinski, voted in February to reconsider a bill that would mandate medical care for infants who survive abortion attempts. Party leadership had blocked it dozens of times from coming to the floor. And both NARAL, which endorsed Newman, and Obama have opposed those types of measures. Polling from the Women Speak Out PAC, which is affiliated with SBA List, showed 75 percent of likely Democratic primary voters in Lipinski’s district supported protections for babies who survive failed abortions. Democrats for Life executive director Kristen Day, who also worked for a pro-life Democrat in Congress, suggested the groups like SBA List didn't do enough to support Lipinski. But more so, Day put the onus on party leadership, which Danenfelser says “watched [Lipinski] die” in his primary. The Illinois Democratic Party and Democratic National Committee (DNC) did not respond to Fox News’ requests for comment. HOUSE DEMS QUASH BILL MANDATING MEDICAL CARE FOR INFANTS WHO SURVIVE ABORTIONS “We need to get rid of Tom Perez,"" Day said, citing to the DNC chair's position on pro-life Democrats. Newman didn't just receive endorsements from progressive leaders and Illinois lawmakers. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), which typically supports incumbents, also offered what’s been described as tepid support for Lipinski’s re-election. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In a statement provided to Fox News, DCCC Chair Cheri Bustos, D-Ill., praised Lipinski’s service. But it's been pointed out that she backed out of a Lipinski fundraiser amid pressure over his pro-life record. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., traveled to Texas to campaign for Rep. Henry Cuellar, an anti-abortion Democrat, but didn’t do the same for Lipinski. Day said after Lipinski’s election that Democrats like herself might just stay home in the presidential election. While she maintains hope for state-level candidates opposing abortion, she warns that emboldened pro-life Democrats may send a national message by sitting out the 2020 presidential election.

"                          Bernie Sanders denies reports he will suspend his campaign after Biden sweeps primaries; Biden campaign senior adviser Symone Sanders reacts. Conversations are underway between the campaigns of former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont regarding the coronavirus pandemic, with a top aide saying the contact is at “a senior level.” The communication between the camps of two remaining Democratic presidential candidates comes as Sanders is mulling his next political move – after a string of devastating primary losses on Tuesday at the hands of the former vice president. BIDEN AND SANDERS LAST CANDIDATES STANDING AS LONG-SHOT GABBARD DROPS OUT OF THE RACE Sanders’ campaign on Wednesday emphasized that “the next primary contest is at least three weeks away. Sen. Sanders is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign.” Biden’s landslide victory in Florida, his crushing defeat of Sanders in Illinois, and his win in Arizona cemented his status as the presumptive Democratic nominee and all but closed the door to the senator’s extremely narrow path to win the nomination. Both candidates late last week gave policy addresses laying out their plans to combat the coronavirus outbreak that’s sweeping across America – as well as steps to assist Americans devastated by the growing economic downturn caused by the pandemic. And both contenders have continued to spotlight their efforts and ideas this week in their public comments. Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said that “since last week, the Biden and Sanders campaigns have been in regular contact at a senior level to discuss how the coronavirus is affecting the campaigns, how to adjust schedules and activities in light of that – as well as to discuss both Vice President Biden’s and Senator Sanders’ ideas on policy responses to the virus.” “While the two campaigns obviously have their differences, they are working together to try to promote the health and safety of their teams, those who interact with the campaigns, and the American people,” she added. Biden camp accuses Trump of downplaying outbreak In a taste of the general election battle ahead, Biden’s campaign on Thursday charged that President Trump is attempting “to erase his months of ignoring medical experts who were sounding the alarm.” “Time after time, President Trump has failed the American people through his negligent and incompetent response to a global health pandemic — squandering months as he blithely downplayed its risks,” Bedingfield argued. An email from the Biden campaign then includes a series of statements and comments from the president from late January through early March where he appeared to be downplaying the severity of the approaching coronavirus outbreak. The list starts with Trump saying on Jan. 22 that “we have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.” And it ends with the president commenting on Monday of last week that “nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!” The Trump campaign hit back in a statement to Fox News. “The only thing Joe Biden knows about handling a public health crisis is that the Obama White House had to apologize for his remarks that set off a panic during the swine flu outbreak in 2009,” said Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign communications director. Said Murtaugh: “And when President Trump took the critical step of restricting travel from China in response to the coronavirus, Biden called it ‘xenophobic.’ Most of what Biden says the government should do are things President Trump is already doing.  The President is leading an unprecedented mobilization of America against the coronavirus and all Joe Biden can offer is ineffective partisan sniping from the sidelines.” As of Thursday afternoon, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported more than 10,000 domestic cases of COVID-19 – the disease caused by the coronavirus – with the death toll standing at 150.” More primaries postponed Connecticut is the latest state with an upcoming presidential primary to postpone its nominating contest. ""In coordination with other states and our Secretary of the State, and in an effort to carry out Democracy while keeping public health a top priority, I have decided to move our presidential primary to June 2nd,"" Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont tweeted on Thursday. With the pandemic sweeping across the nation, presidential primaries that took place Tuesday in Arizona, Florida, and Illinois may well be the last nominating contests held for the next couple of months. Ohio’s primary was also scheduled to be held Tuesday – but state officials used emergency powers to postpone the contest hours before the polls were set to open. After the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) urged against any gatherings of 50 people or more, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine stressed on Monday that “we cannot conduct this election tomorrow.” Primaries scheduled for next Tuesday in Georgia, April 4 in Louisiana, and May 19 in Kentucky already have been pushed back to later dates. Maryland announced earlier this week that their April 28 primary is being postponed until June 2. Democratic Party officials in Puerto Rico – which would hold its contest on March 29 – are seeking a delay as well. More delays are likely to follow for states scheduled to hold contests in the coming weeks. Biden grabs another high profile endorsement Another former 2020 Democratic presidential nomination rival is backing Biden. This time it’s Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. The former White House hopeful saying in a statement on Thursday that “it is clear that our country desperately needs a president with experience, honesty and integrity -- that person is Vice President Joe Biden. Not only does Joe have the experience to lead our country, but he has the empathy and character to go with it.” Gillibrand – who made championing the rights of women an integral part of her presidential campaign – took shots at the former vice president during the second round of primary debates in late July of last year.  Running short on campaign cash and failing to resonate in the polls, Gillibrand ended her presidential bid a month later.

"                          Fox Business host Stuart Varney believes a recession is on the way. Ray Dalio, the billionaire founder of hedge fund behemoth Bridgewater Associates, sounded the alarm Thursday over the coronavirus crisis and said U.S. corporations will lose up to $4 trillion and President Trump needs to dramatically increase his stimulus plan. NEWSOM ISSUES STAY AT HOME ORDER Dalio’s comments come a day after Bill Ackman, another billionaire investor, called on the president to shut down the country for 30 days or “America will end as we know it.” CORONAVIRUS LATEST Few people understand the global economy like Dalio. He told CNBC that the coronavirus crisis is something not seen “in our lifetime.” He said there will be some who suffer “very big losses” and in order to soften the blow, the federal government needs to spend more money. “A lot more money.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell unveiled a sweeping economic rescue plan Thursday to pump $1,200 direct checks to taxpayers, $300 billion for small businesses to keep idled workers on payroll and $208 billion in loans to airlines and other industries. The GOP leader’s effort builds on Trump’s request for Congress to “go big” as lawmakers race to craft a $1 trillion economic aid and stimulus package amid the pandemic crisis and nationwide shutdown that’s hurtling the country toward a likely recession.       Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates LP, speaks during a panel discussion at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Beijing, China, on Thursday, Nov. 21, 2019. PHOTO: Takaaki Iwabu/Bloomberg via Getty Images       Dalio said the stimulus package should be, minimum, $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion. The Federal Reserve put in motion two emergency lending programs Tuesday that were last deployed in response to the 2008 financial crisis, aiming to ease the flow of credit to businesses and households struggling amid the viral outbreak. The first is intended to unclog a short-term lending market for what is known as “commercial paper.” The second is also intended to mostly assist the commercial paper market and allows a wider range of financial institutions to access short-term loans from the Fed — in this case investment banks and securities trading divisions of large banks. It also allows them to pledge a wider range of collateral in return for the loans. The funds will then mostly be used to purchase commercial paper.

In a video posted to her Twitter account, Blackburn called China's threats to plunge the U.S. into a ""mighty sea of coronavirus"" by withholding access to critical medication a national security and public health issue. ""Relying on foreign countries like China for instance, for our pharmaceutical supply chain can lead us to critical shortages,"" she said.

China maintains a grip on the global supply chain. Though the United States is a global leader in research, much of the manufacturing of lifesaving drugs has moved overseas.

"                          Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. It was a cruel mirage. The midday sun burned off the chill of the March morning. Foreboding, iron-grey clouds slinked away. A low sun finally pried its way through the sheath, teasing a powder-blue sky. The U.S. Capitol Dome spiked into the air. An American flag flapping in the east wind. The temperature struggled into the low sixties. It was a reminder that spring was just days away. The panorama was nearly perfect. But this wasn’t an honest tableau. It was a deceitful scene, a trick. One that hid the misery and pain lurking at the microbial level. A cloak shrouding pending economic chaos and human catastrophe inflicted by the coronavirus. This wasn’t any ordinary sun shining down on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. This was a 9/11 sun. We’ve seen that sun before in Washington, D.C. In New York City. In Shanksville, Pa. Sept. 11, 2001, was a radiant day in the eastern U.S. And as the World Trade Center Towers smoldered and the Pentagon belched a tower of soot, that same, brilliant sun mocked us. The firefighters who raced to douse the flames only to perish in an inferno. The military pilots who contemplated a suicide mission. They discussed ramming their jet fighters into the rogue commercial aircraft bound for Washington. The people who dashed from the Capitol, losing heels and strewing briefcases along the East Front, sprinting for their lives. This sun was a fraud on Tuesday. An imposter, concealing perhaps weeks and months of social upheaval that could resonate for a generation. Each day, the information grows more grim. The market tanks. The cases rise. Companies shred jobs. There are no sports. No bars. No theater. No concerts. It doesn’t take much of an imagination to envision a dystopian world resembling the album cover of practically every heavy metal band from the 1980s. I saw the sun Tuesday because I wasn’t in the U.S. Capitol very much that day. Or Wednesday, for that matter. On a normal day when Congress is in session, I may be inside the Capitol complex for 10 to 12 hours at a time. During President Trump’s impeachment trial -- which I’m pretty sure happened around the time of the Moon Landing -- I may have arrived at the Capitol just as dawn broke. As the trial drifted deep into the night, I wouldn’t experience fresh air again until close to midnight after doing a live report or two once the session wrapped.       Chad Pergram reporting from Capitol Hill.       But now we have to engage in “social distancing.” The U.S. Capitol complex is scarily vacant these days. The Rotunda is empty and hollow. It echoes like a mausoleum. Paintings of George Washington and Hernando De Soto stare at each other. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Here’s who’s at the U.S. Capitol each day: U.S. Capitol Police officers. Custodial staff. Maintenance staff. Some of the “institutional” staff. Most House and Senate aides have teleworked for a while now. As House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., negotiated the “phase 2” coronavirus package with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Congressional Republicans last week, only a smattering of lawmakers was anywhere near the Capitol. They kept their distance. Most lawmakers only rolled in after midnight early Saturday to vote on the bill. The House roll call ended at 12:51 am. PHOTOS: CORONAVIRUS SAFEGUARDS AND ACTIONS ACROSS THE US But who waited outside Pelosi’s office all day and deep into the night? A cadre of journalists. The Capitol press corps numbers are a lot lower than usual right now. But the reporters vastly outnumber the aides and certainly senators who periodically wander by. Mnuchin huddled with a group of Republican senators in the Mike Mansfield Room of the Capitol Monday night to discuss upcoming legislative steps. Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., exited the meeting in the Ohio Clock Corridor. Reporters were torn. They needed to talk to Braun to get a readout -- but also keep their distance. Reporters fanned out, hollering questions at Braun from several feet away. When someone asked the Indiana Republican to speak up, Braun instinctively stepped closer to the reporters. Someone gently admonished the senator not to come closer but just to talk a little louder. Senate Republicans finally stopped squeezing together for their regular conclaves in the Mansfield Room of the Capitol or the even tinier Strom Thurmond Room. When Mnuchin, White House Economic Adviser Larry Kudlow and White House Legislative Director Eric Ueland met with Senate Republicans Tuesday, they convened in the much grander Kennedy Caucus Room in the Russell Senate Office Building. The room is best known for hosting Supreme Court confirmation hearings and investigations into the sinking of the Titanic. By Thursday, Republican senators began conducting their meetings in the even more commodious “Central Hearing Facility” in the Hart Senate Office Building. That room hosted confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh of late. Senate Democrats have held their discussions via conference call. PHOTOS: EMPTY PLACES ACROSS AMERICA Few senators roamed anywhere near the chamber all week except when the Senate called a series of votes Wednesday afternoon on the “phase 2” coronavirus bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., advised senators he would elongate roll call votes from the standard 15 minutes to 30 minutes (even though most usually take about 25). “Senators should come in, vote and leave,” instructed McConnell, worried that senators would congregate for long chunks of time in the well of the chamber. And so, this is what makes it hard as a reporter to cover Congress in the time of coronavirus. The Capitol press corps usually stakes out lawmakers in the Senate subway stations, just off the floor, by committee rooms and in the Speaker’s Lobby. It may not be hygienic for a gaggle of reporters to cluster around a member -- or even chat one-on-one, walking through the tunnel to the Russell Senate Office Building. Under normal circumstances, most TV reporters do their live reports from several different locations on Capitol Hill. One such spot is called the “Will Rogers” area near the House floor. That’s because it’s close to the Will Rogers Statue. A lot of other reports come from the rotundas in the Russell Building or the Cannon House Office Building. But, since it’s spring, and the weather is improving, Fox News made an effort to do live reports from a location near the House steps, known as the Elm Tree. That’s a misnomer because the Elm Tree that used to stand there is long gone. But the spot presents a dynamic, television-friendly backdrop of the U.S. Capitol. CORONAVIRUS CASES TOP 200,000, DEATH TOLL PASSES 8,000 That’s why I was outside Tuesday afternoon to watch the clouds split, opening the sky to a striking pre-spring day. And there was the sun. Bright. Bold. And an artifice in contrast to the chaos unfolding around the globe. However... The sun rose the morning after 9/11. It also rose on the other 6,753 days between 9/12 and this past Tuesday. The coronavirus scourge will subside at some point. And when the sun shines then, it will serve as a partner. Days of baseball games and strolls by the cherry blossoms near the Tidal Basin here in Washington. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It’s the same sun as it always was. The same sun as on 9/11. The sun that shone over the Spanish Flu. The same sun that stared down on the Bubonic Plague in Europe. That sun may seem cruel now, beaming down on the U.S. Capitol. But it will be there when there are again wedding celebrations. Graduations. Births. Parties. Promotions. Electric first dates. And, those aforementioned ballgames. That may not be the sun as we perceive it now. Pandemics come and go. But not the sun. It will be there on the other side.

In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, President Trump will now hold the annual G-7 Summit in June via teleconference, rather than inviting the other six other G-7 nations to Camp David as originally planned. Trump had originally planned to host the leaders of the seven major industrial nations -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan along with the United States -- at his private golf resort in Miami, before moving it to Camp David after public criticism. Now the leaders will convene electronically to allow “each country to focus all of its resources on responding to the health and economic challenges of COVID-19,” economic advisor Larry Kudlow informed his colleagues, according to White House spokesman Judd Deere. Trump already spoke with G-7 leaders Monday in a meeting organized by French President Emmanuel Macron. Deere said Trump, who holds leadership of the group this year, would hold virtual meetings monthly as the world battles COVID-19 and its economic fallout. The announcement came as the world has faced 229,390 cases of the novel coronavirus and 9,325 deaths and many countries across the globe institute travel bans and social distancing guidelines. The U.S. currently has 10,755 confirmed cases and 154 deaths. Trump irritated certain G-7 nations when he instituted a European travel ban without consulting European leaders.

Former aides to high-ranking Democratic politicians are joining a so-called ""coronavirus war room"" in order to attack President Trump's response to the pandemic. Protect Our Care -- a nonprofit tied to liberal dark money groups -- announced the war room on Thursday, with the group's leader accusing Trump of exacerbating the pandemic. Heading the war room is Zac Petkanas, a former adviser to Hillary Clinton and former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Sarah Chase, a former research associate for the presidential campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., is joining the team as well. Patrick Devlin, former Communications Director for Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., will serve as an adviser to the war room as well.

"                          Trump signs the Defense Production Act to possibly ramp up inventories of desperately needed medical supplies; chief White House correspondent John Roberts reports. We are about to embark on a trillion-dollar effort to bolster an economy being ravaged by the coronavirus. And given the magnitude of the problem, everyone in politics is scrambling to get on board. Never mind that Republicans have long been the party of limited government, shrinking deficits and battling bailouts. Perhaps it’s true that in a pandemic, we’re all socialists. In any event, President Trump is leading the effort, and he has virtually total control over the GOP as he runs for reelection. I’ve long argued that both parties are hypocritical when it comes to red ink, denouncing it only when the other party controls the White House. But that argument is moot right now. A virtual shutdown of America requires a response akin to war -- a term the administration is now using regularly. BIDEN’S VICTORIES SWALLOWED BY VIRUS, LIKE MUCH OF AMERICAN LIFE The damage to the economy grows by the day. The stock market has nose-dived, giving up all its gains since Trump took office. Businesses across the country, especially retail outlets, are laying off workers or slashing their pay (jobless claims, up 70,000 last week, are starting to soar). And tens of millions of Americans are hunkered down at home and not spending money. Trump is pushing Congress to approve $500 billion in cash payments to Americans, $300 billion to help small businesses, $50 billion to shore up the airlines now that travel has plummeted, and $150 billion for other industries. The details, of course, will be hotly debated. But as the Washington Post points out, “The president and many of his conservative allies rose to power on the strength of a grass-roots movement forged in opposition to the bank bailouts during the 2008 financial crisis and President Obama’s subsequent economic stimulus package.” It was easy to hate TARP, since big and reckless banks got bailed out, with no one going to jail, while ordinary Americans lost their homes and jobs. But the virus is just as much an existential threat to financial stability, or more, and some on the right are calling it an act of God--the better to justify their support of massive government spending. At stake, says the Post, is whether Trump is remembered as Herbert Hoover or FDR. The paper quoted one White House official as saying Trump “doesn’t give a [expletive]” about the plan’s impact on the federal debt. “It’s all about the markets and the economy for him. It’s all about the jobs numbers.” And politically, most Americans would probably agree. The debt seems a far-off and abstract concern. But while a massive bailout (or stimulus or other euphemism) is a virtual certainty, there will be a debate about the role of government. Is sending people $2,000 checks more than a Band-Aid? How small does a small business have to be to get aid? Should the airlines, like the car industry a decade ago, be limited to loans that have to be repaid? Jonah Goldberg, in the Dispatch, says that “every five minutes, someone on Twitter or TV says that this crisis proves the need for government, as if the opposite view dominated public life. It doesn’t.” Virtually everyone on the right, the conservative pundit says, believes the feds should go full steam ahead in a pandemic. “This is one of most infuriating rhetorical sleights-of-hand in ideological debates: Take an example of a problem the government should deal with, and then claim it proves that there is no problem the government shouldn’t deal with. I want the government to nuke a meteor heading our way. That doesn’t mean I must think we should have a federal minimum wage.” SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES But that argument is for another day. Mistakes were made, in Ronald Reagan’s famous phrase. A Trump administration simulation last year of a killer virus that would start in China “drove home just how underfunded, underprepared and uncoordinated the federal government would be for a life-or-death battle with a virus for which no treatment existed,” says the New York Times. We can and will fight about what happened in the past and what will happen down the road. But politicians are casting their usual beliefs aside over the clear-and-present danger that urgent action is needed right now.

'Tucker Carlson Tonight' will have more on the story on Friday. Tucker Carlson Thursday called on Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., to resign if he can't explain why he sold millions in stock in mid-February before the market fell amid the coronavirus outbreak. “He had inside information about what could happen to our country, which is now happening,"" Carlson said on his show ""Tucker Carlson Tonight.""

He said Burr instead ""dumped his shares in hotel stocks so he wouldn’t lose money and then he stayed silent.""

"                          President Trump announced he will invoke the Defense Production Act, which aims to better prepare the U.S. for the manufacturing and distribution of medical supplies amid coronavirus. Despite pleas from governors, members of Congress and presidential candidates, President Trump so far has resisted using his powers under the Defense Production Act as officials look to ramp up the American medical system's capacity in anticipation of a spike in demand due to the coronavirus pandemic. On Wednesday, Trump invoked the Defense Production Act, the Korean War-era statute that allows the president to direct manufacturers to make certain equipment that is necessary for the United States to deal with a crisis, whether that be a war or a pandemic, in order ""to promote the national defense."" But as of Friday morning, he has not actually taken action under the law, tweeting Wednesday that he only signed the act ""should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future. Hopefully there will be no need...."" That has concerned officials across the political spectrum who see an immediate need for things like personal protective equipment (PPE) for medical professionals who will be treating patients sick with the novel coronavirus. A potential shortage has concerned medical professionals and even led multiple TV medical dramas to donate the masks they use in their wardrobe to hospitals. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW TRUMP INVOKES DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT: WHAT IS IT? Trump was asked about what he might do under the Defense Production Act Thursday by Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican. ""I just have two things on the PPE issue which obviously is a huge issue for all of us,"" Baker said on a teleconference the Trump administration held with governors. ""The first is, it's just a little bit about the guidance you're going to offer ... some guidance on how the implementation of the Defense Production Act is going to work with respect to trying to man up and generate initial capacity around this PPE stuff."" Trump turned to Vice President Pence, who is heading up the White House Coronavirus Task Force, to answer Baker's question. He pointed to a desire to let U.S. firms cooperate voluntarily as long as that is possible. MARSHA BLACKBURN: CHINA'S THREAT TO PLUNGE US INTO 'MIGHTY SEA OF CORONAVIRUS' MEANS AMERICA MUST ACT ""I think, Mr. President, you put it well when you talk about the spirit in American business about wanting to ramp up voluntarily to meet the needs that our health care providers have in this country is truly inspiring,"" Pence said. ""And so the president has not yet exercised his authority under the Defense Production Act. He said he will if he needs to. But I think ... the president's perception, the team's perception is now as American industry is stepping forward very aggressively."" Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, the chairman of the National Governors Association and also a Republican, seconds later continued to prod Trump on the production of medical equipment, specifically protective equipment for those treating coronavirus patients. He asked Trump for ""some guidance on implementation of the Defense Production Act so we can kind of help work with [Health and Human Services] Secretary [Alex] Azar and give some thoughts about how the states could be more involved in helping that with some industries in our state."" Democrats, meanwhile, have taken direct swipes at the president for not immediately exercising his powers under the act -- a point of continuing partisan strain even as both parties are working together on legislation to aid Americans affected by the crisis. ""What is going on here, President Trump?"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., tweeted late Thursday night. ""We called on you to invoke the Defense Production Act. But in addition, we expect you to use it immediately. Why aren’t you using this authority now to make testing kits, masks, beds, ventilators?"" MCCONNELL'S CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS PLAN WOULD PROVIDE PAYMENTS OF $1,200 PER PERSON, $2,400 FOR COUPLES Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden also publicly implored Trump to ramp up supply under the Defense Production Act. In a statement Wednesday, Biden said Trump should ""[p]rioritize and immediately increase domestic production of any critical medical equipment required to respond to this crisis"" under the Defense Production Act. The former vice president followed that statement with a tweet Thursday urging Trump to use his Defense Production Act powers. ""Yesterday, President Trump said he was invoking the Defense Production Act, then turned around and said he wasn't planning to use it,"" Biden said. ""The President should exercise these powers now.

"                          Reaction from Trump 2020 campaign director of communications Tim Murtaugh. It was no surprise when President Trump captured enough delegates this week to become the presumptive Republican presidential nominee – but what has been unusual is the sheer number of votes he’s racked up in a virtually non-competitive primary. Trump has won about twice as many votes in most state primaries as predecessors Barack Obama did in 2012 and George W. Bush did in 2004, during their respective party primaries. TRUMP SECURES GOP PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION WITH TUESDAY'S PRIMARY VICTORIES The Trump campaign says he’s even set an overall primary record, earning “at least four million votes more than the previous record for total votes cast for an incumbent president in those same states, held by former President Bill Clinton in his 1996 re-election campaign.” This is no accident. The big turnout follows a concerted get-out-the-vote drive that has included rallies ahead of competitive Democratic contests. Previous presidents were typically content to let members of the rival party bludgeon one another and then pounce on the eventual nominee, noted Gary Rose, chairman of the political science department at Sacred Heart University. “It could be an apples to oranges comparison,” Rose, author of Haywire: A Chronology of the 2016 Presidential Contest, told Fox News. “Obama and Bush didn’t really campaign during the primary season. The president and his advisers know his approval has never been above 50 percent and they realize they have to keep the momentum. If he were wildly popular, he wouldn’t have to hold massive rallies. That said, Trump has the most devoted and passionate voters I’ve seen in many years.” Victories in the Florida and Illinois Republican primaries on Tuesday gave Trump 1,330 delegates, well above the 1,276 needed to win the nomination. His only remaining GOP primary opponent, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, dropped out the next day. Nine state Republican parties opted not to hold primaries this year. Trump set records for votes won by an incumbent president in Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Washington, according to Trump’s campaign. “Nobody motivates our base more than President Trump, as evidenced by the historic turnout we've seen in state after state this primary season,” Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told Fox News in a statement. “Fueled by both our longtime supporters and the thousands of new voters that continue to join our movement, we are united and enthusiasm is on our side,” McDaniel continued. “We have the strongest record of success, an unparalleled grassroots infrastructure, and are thrilled to have President Trump as our Party’s presumptive nominee once again.” It’s too early to know what this portends for November, particularly in a time of a national crisis with the coronavirus pandemic. As Trump and Congress scramble to respond with a massive stimulus package, the possibility of a looming recession and the ongoing Wall Street chaos could cloud the president’s core campaign message about a hitherto booming economy. In another comparison, Trump is performing strongly among Republicans in blue states. In California, where votes are still being counted from the March 3 primary, Trump is just under 2.2 million votes compared with Obama’s 2.07 million votes in the 2012 Democratic primary. In Massachusetts, Trump scored almost twice as many votes this year as Obama did in 2012, winning 236,692 votes. Obama won 127,992 votes and, in 2004, George W. Bush won 62,773 votes in the Bay State. While these are states that Trump almost certainly won’t carry in November, it is a barometer for voter enthusiasm. TRUMP CAMPAIGN MOCKS DEM PRIMARY, SAYS PRESIDENT IS ON 'UNSTOPPABLE' PATH TO REELECTION Conversely, Obama was embarrassed in some red states during the 2012 Democratic primaries. In West Virginia, 43 percent of Democratic primary voters chose an inmate from Texas that managed to get on the ballot over Obama. In Kentucky, 42 percent of Democrats voted for an “uncommitted” delegate slate over Obama. In Arkansas, 41.6 percent of Democrats voted for an unknown Tennessee lawyer over Obama. Still, the most relevant comparison going into November are polls that consistently show likely Democratic nominee and former Vice President Joe Biden leading Trump in a head-to-head match-up. The Real Clear Politics average of polls shows Biden handily beating Trump by almost 7 percent. “Polls show Biden ahead, but I don’t put much credence in polls anymore,” said Rose, of Sacred Heart University. “If Democrats can mobilize, Biden can win. But Trump’s people and Republicans will be at the polls. His crowds are much larger.” Even in the foreseeable future when neither candidate is having public rallies, Rose said Trump’s campaign—with a strong fundraising advantage—can make up for lack of rallies with social media and TV advertising. Trump won 1.8 million votes in the March 3 Texas primary, compared with Obama’s 520,410 in the 2012 primary. Perhaps more surprising is Trump’s 2020 numbers trounced those of George W. Bush, a former Texas governor, who won 635,948 in 2004. Notably, Bill Clinton gained 796,041 in the 1996 Texas primary. In the battleground state of Michigan, Trump won 639,143 votes in the state’s primary, compared with 174,054 for Obama in the 2012 Democratic primary and 265,425 for Clinton in 1996. Michigan didn’t hold a Republican primary in 2004. Trump narrowly won Michigan in 2016 against Democrat Hillary Clinton.

"                          Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California and three of her Senate colleagues sold off stocks worth millions of dollars in the days before the coronavirus outbreak crashed the market, according to reports. The data is listed on a U.S. Senate website containing financial disclosures from Senate members. Feinstein, who serves as ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and her husband sold between $1.5 million and $6 million in stock in California biotech company Allogene Therapeutics, between Jan. 31 and Feb. 18, The New York Times reported. SENS. RICHARD BURR, KELLY LOEFFLER SOLD MILLIONS IN STOCK BEFORE CORONAVIRUS CRIPPLED MARKETS, REPORTS FIND When questioned by the newspaper, a spokesman for the Democrat from San Francisco said Feinstein wasn’t directly involved in the sale. “All of Senator Feinstein’s assets are in a blind trust,” the spokesman, Tom Mentzer, told the Times. “She has no involvement in her husband’s financial decisions.” “All of Senator Feinstein’s assets are in a blind trust. She has no involvement in her husband’s financial decisions.”       Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., is seen in an undated photo. (Associated Press)       Reports identified the three other senators as Richard Burr of North Carolina, Kelly Loeffler of Georgia and James Inhofe of Oklahoma, all Republicans. Burr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, used more than 30 transactions to dump between $628,000 and $1.72 million on Feb. 13, according to ProPublica. The report said the transactions involved a significant percentage of the senator’s holdings and took place about a week before the impact of the virus outbreak sent stock prices plunging to the point where gains made during President Trump’s term in office were largely erased. “Senator Burr filed a financial disclosure form for personal transactions made several weeks before the U.S. and financial markets showed signs of volatility due to the growing coronavirus outbreak,” a Burr spokesperson said. “As the situation continues to evolve daily, he has been deeply concerned by the steep and sudden toll this pandemic is taking on our economy.” Burr was an author of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, a law that helps determine the federal response to situations such as the coronavirus outbreak, ProPublica reported. Burr’s office would not comment on what kind of information Burr might have received about coronavirus prior to his stock sales, the outlet reported. NPR reported that Burr made ominous comments about coronavirus behind closed doors last month. “There’s one thing that I can tell you about this: It is much more aggressive in its transmission than anything that we have seen in recent history,” Burr said at a Feb. 27 meeting of business leaders in Washington. “It is probably more akin to the 1918 pandemic.” Loeffler was appointed to the Senate in December by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp after incumbent Sen. Johnny Isakson resigned because of health issues – despite allies of President Trump having urged Kemp to select Rep. Doug Collins instead. Loeffler and her husband, Jeffrey Sprecher, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, sold stock Jan. 24, the same day she sat in on a briefing from two members of Trump’s Coronavirus Task Force, The Daily Beast reported. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Between that day and Feb. 14, the couple sold stock worth a total between $1.2 million and $3.1 million, the report said. In addition to the sales, they also purchased stock in a maker of software that helps people work at home – just before millions of Americans were forced to leave their offices because of the outbreak, the report said. Loeffler slammed the Daily Beast report as a ""ridiculous and baseless attack"" in a pair of late-night tweets. ""This is a ridiculous and baseless attack. I do not make investment decisions for my portfolio. Investment decisions are made by multiple third-party advisors without my or my husband's knowledge or involvement,"" Loeffler wrote. ""As confirmed in the periodic transaction report to Senate Ethics, I was informed of these purchases and sales on February 16, 2020 — three weeks after they were made."" In an interview Friday with Fox News’ Ed Henry, Loeffler again said any claim of insider trading is “absolutely false.” She added, “I’m not involved in the decisions” of buying and selling, while saying she’d cooperate if any investigation is launched. Inhofe sold as much as $400,000 in stock all on Jan. 27, in companies such as PayPal, Apple and real estate company Brookfield Asset Management, The New York Times reported.

"                          With growing fears of the coronavirus pandemic, states have begun to respond by postponing their primary elections. Here are the states that have begun to take these initial steps. The spreading coronavirus outbreak has shut down more and more of American life — including schools, sporting events, bars, and now even elections. Multiple states have either announced they are postponing their presidential primary elections due to concerns about the novel coronavirus or made clear they are considering it. In an interview after the most recent presidential debate -- which was held in a closed-off studio rather than in a hall with a live audience -- presidential candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders hinted that it could be worth moving primary elections to protect against the coronavirus. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW TRAVELING DURING THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK: WHAT TO PACK ""I would hope that governors listen to the public health experts and what they are saying is … we don’t want gatherings of more than 50 people,” Sanders said. “I’m thinking about some of the elderly people sitting behind the desks, registering people and doing all that stuff. Does that make sense? I’m not sure it does."" Here are the states that are putting off their presidential primary elections: Louisiana Louisiana became the first state to postpone a primary or caucus on March 13, with Gov. John Bel Edwards signing an executive order to move the April 4 election to late June. ""Today I have certified that a state of emergency exists and requested that the governor issue an executive order postponing the elections this spring. We have requested postponing the April 4 primary election until June 20 and postponing the May 9 general election until July 25,"" Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin said. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES UNDER SIEGE AMID CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE: REPORT Christina Stephens, a spokeswoman for Edwards, said the move was to prevent further person-to-person transmission of the virus in Louisiana. ""We are experiencing community spread of coronavirus in Louisiana and the governor is taking decisive action to slow its progress,"" she said. Georgia Georgia also moved its elections from March 24 to May 19 on March 14 after Gov. Brian Kemp declared a state of emergency. LINDSAY GRAHAM TESTS NEGATIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS AS CONGRESS WORKS TO KEEP MEMBERS, STAFF HEALTHY ""Events are moving rapidly and my highest priority is protecting the health of our poll workers, their families, and the community at large,"" said Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Ohio Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine asked a judge on March 16 to allow his state to postpone its election, originally scheduled for Tuesday, March 17, to June 2. ""We cannot conduct this election tomorrow,” he stressed in an announcement. After the judge ruled that the election would have to go forward, DeWine announced that he would prevent polls from opening anyway, with his state health director closing down polls ""as a health emergency."" DEMOCRACY 2020 DIGEST: OHIO TO ORDER POLLS CLOSED OVER CORONAVIRUS 'EMERGENCY,' GOVERNOR SAYS DeWine said that the state's in-person voting would not conform with CDC guidelines for preventing the spread of the coronavirus, and vowed to find a way to hold a ""free and fair"" election without putting voters' health at risk. ""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,"" DeWine said in a statement. ""As such, Health Director Dr. Amy Acton will order the polls closed as a health emergency. While the polls will be closed tomorrow, Secretary of State Frank LaRose will seek a remedy through the courts to extend voting options so that every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity."" The Ohio Supreme Court, in a ruling without an opinion Tuesday morning, denied a last-second effort to force the state to move ahead with the Tuesday elections, giving further legitimacy to DeWine's 11th-hour maneuver. Officials in the other three states slated to have elections Tuesday -- Arizona, Florida and Illinois -- confirmed Monday that they would still go through with their plans. Kentucky On recommendation from Kentucky Secretary of State Michael G. Adams, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear pushed back that state's primary from May 19 to June 23. ""I never would have imagined sitting here discussing this with you, but these are unprecedented times,"" Adams said in a video posted to Twitter. ""And we Kentuckians are having to change the way we do things on all fronts. Kentucky law allows the secretary of state and the governor to jointly act to change the time of an election due to a state of emergency."" He continued: ""Postponing the primary was not an easy decision, but the Republican secretary of state and Democratic governor agree, and so do county clerks of both parties, and they are our frontline election administrators. My hope is that this delay will allow us to have a normal election. Even if not, this delay will allow me, the state board of elections and our county clerks time to assess what changes we must make to ensure a successful primary election. There could be more changes, but this was a first step to buy is time and keep our citizens as safe as possible. We'll get through this."" Kentucky was originally slated to have one of the latest primaries of any state, with only five states and Washington, D.C., voting after it. This move by Kentucky throws into question almost the entire 2020 primary calendar, especially after President Trump's comments that the coronavirus pandemic could last until July or August in the United States. Maryland Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced in a March 17 press conference that he is postponing Maryland's April 28 primary election to June 2, making Maryland the sixth state or territory to put off its primaries amid coronavirus fears. ""I have two main priorities: keeping Marylanders safe and protecting their constitutional right to vote,"" Hogan said. ""Yesterday we announced that gatherings of more than 50 people are prohibited statewide, and it would endanger public health to allow thousands of people to assemble in places like schools and senior centers which are already closed under the state of emergency."" Hogan also mentioned the 7th Congressional District seat which was vacated by the death of Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md. Hogan said he has instructed the state board of elections to hold the April 28 special election -- in what is a heavily blue district -- by mail. Democratic nominee Kweisi Mfume, who held the 7th Congressional District seat before Cummings, is widely expected to win that election, retaking a seat he held in the 1990's. Hogan said it is important that Maryland have a representative from the 7th District, which is centered around Baltimore, in Congress. Connecticut Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont announced March 19 that his state would move its primary, previously scheduled for April 28, to June 2. ""My most important concerns are allowing every Connecticut voter to make their voice heard in the selection of the presidential candidates, and ensuring that they are able to cast their ballots as safely as possible,"" Connecticut Secretary of State Denise Merrill said in a statement on the election change. She said that moving the primary was ""a recognition of the severity and the nature of this crisis and, along with my request to temporarily remove restrictive absentee ballot language from the statute, will allow the maximum number of Connecticut voters to participate in the electoral process, even if they wish to avoid gathering in a polling place."" Maryland was also scheduled for April 28 and moved its primary to June 2. Puerto Rico Though it is not a state, Puerto Rico holds primaries for both parties. The Puerto Rico Republican primary already took place on March 8, but the Puerto Rico Democratic Party requested that the government delay its Democratic primary, which was scheduled for March 29. ""This is an unpredictable day-by-day situation that requires constant monitoring of the progress of the disease. Our intention is to keep all options open to ensure the citizen's right to vote,"" party Chairman Charles Rodriguez said in a statement. The Spanish-language news site El Nuevo Dia reported that on March 16 the Puerto Rico Senate approved a resolution that postpones the territory's Democratic primary to April 26 and gives the president of its elections commission the power to move the primary even further if he decides it is still not safe to hold an election. Alabama CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Alabama held its presidential primary elections on Super Tuesday, so it was able to have its say on the presidential nominees before the coronavirus became a full-blown crisis. But Gov. Kay Ivey was forced to delay the state's March 31 primary runoff elections to July 14. That runoff includes the battle for the Republican U.S. Senate nomination between former Trump Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Trump-endorsed former Auburn University head football coach Tommy Tuberville.

President Trump is expected to announce Friday that he is restricting travel between U.S. and Mexico, and implementing additional restrictions with Canada, in the latest move by the administration to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, Fox News has learned. It is unclear, at this point, what the new restrictions will be, but Fox News has learned it involves the U.S.-Mexico border, and additional travel restrictions between the U.S. and Canada. Trump announced earlier this week that he and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had agreed to temporarily close their shared border to non-essential traffic. STATE DEPARTMENT ADVISES AMERICANS TO AVOID ALL INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL AMID CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK “We will be, by mutual consent, temporarily closing our Northern Border with Canada to non-essential traffic,” Trump tweeted Wednesday. “Trade will not be affected. Details to follow!” It is unclear what additional restrictions the president could announce regarding Canada, and to what extent travel to and from Mexico could be affected. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said Friday from the White House that the administration is ""taking a look at all angles"" and ""not just foreign travel restrictions, but what we can do here at home."" Wolf told reporters that the administration is hoping to keep the border open so that economic activity continues, but that the administration is ""talking to Mexican colleagues"" and could temporarily suspend ""non-essential travel going across land ports of entry."" The expected announcement comes after the World Health Organization designated COVID-19 a pandemic last week. Following that designation, Trump announced a temporary halt on air travel to the United States from Europe, initially excluding flights from the United Kingdom and those carrying cargo, in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. Trump then declared a national emergency over the outbreak and moved to ban travel from the U.K. as well. Meanwhile, on Thursday, the State Department advised U.S. citizens to avoid all international travel due to the outbreak of COVID-19, urging Americans abroad to arrange for “an immediate return” to the U.S. unless they plan to stay out of the country for “an indefinite period.” The State Department also warned that U.S. citizens living abroad “should avoid all international travel.” “Many countries are experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks and implementing travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines, closing borders, and prohibiting non-citizens from entry with little advance notice,” the State Department said. “Airlines have cancelled many international flights and several cruise operators have suspended operations or cancelled trips.” The department added: “If you choose to travel internationally, your travel plans may be severely disrupted, and you may be forced to remain outside of the United States for an indefinite timeframe.” TRUMP ANNOUNCES US, CANADA CLOSING BORDER TO 'NON-ESSENTIAL TRAFFIC' AMID CORONAVIRUS FEARS Last week, the State Department authorized the departure of U.S. personnel and family members from any diplomatic or consular post in the world who ""have determined they are at higher risk of a poor outcome if exposed to COVID-19 or who have requested departure based on a commensurate justification.” The department said Thursday that ""these departures may limit the ability of U.S. Embassies and consulates to provide services to U.S. citizens.” As of Friday morning, the U.S. had 14,250 confirmed cases of coronavirus in all 50 states, including Washington, D.C. The U.S., so far, has seen 205 COVID-19-related deaths. The Trump administration’s task force predicted Tuesday that the number of cases in the U.S. could peak in about 45 days.

Former 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Andrew Yang announced Friday that his new nonprofit will distribute at least $1 million in $1,000 cash payments to 1,000 working households in New York amid the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak. Yang, a CNN contributor, on Friday said his nonprofit, Humanity Forward, would give the funds to 1,000 low-income households in the Bronx. YANG RESPONDS TO WHITE HOUSE GOAL OF SENDING CASH TO AMERICANS AMID CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK “Given the nature of this crisis, we thought it was imperative to act now and get money into people’s hands, and also demonstrate that this is exactly what our government should be doing,” Yang told NBC News. Yang, since suspending his 2020 presidential campaign, has been rumored to be considering a run for New York City mayor. Yang said the funds would be distributed as a one-time payment and would be released within the next two weeks. According to NBC News, the funds will go to clients of Neighborhood Trust Financial Partners, another financial empowerment nonprofit organization. Yang reportedly said his coronavirus relief efforts will also include $100,000 in smaller grants of $250 and $500 to individuals who ask for emergency funds on social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. During his presidential campaign, Yang was best known for promoting a Universal Basic Income (UBI), which would guarantee $1,000 per month for every American adult from the federal government. Yang’s latest move is in line with the proposal rolled out by Senate Republicans on Thursday, which would provide as much as $1,200 per person and $2,400 per couple in response to the crisis.

Reports of multiple senators selling stocks before the coronavirus pandemic rocked the markets have renewed attention on something called the STOCK Act. The STOCK Act is a law that was passed in 2012 that says members of Congress and other government employees, including congressional staffers and members of the executive branch and judiciary, are not allowed to engage in insider trading based off information they learn through their jobs. If there are any legal consequences for the current controversy, this law would be at the center of it.

"                           GOP Rep. Doug Collins slammed primary rival Sen. Kelly Loeffler on Friday, saying he is “sickened” over new allegations that she sold off millions of dollars of stocks in the days before the coronavirus outbreak crashed the market. “People are losing their jobs, their businesses, their retirements, and even their lives and Kelly Loeffler is profiting off their pain? I’m sickened just thinking about it,” Collins, R-Ga., tweeted Friday. FEINSTEIN, 3 GOP SENATE COLLEAGUES SOLD OFF STOCKS BEFORE CORONAVIRUS CRASH: REPORT Collins' comments come as Loeffler, R-Ga., along with Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., James Inhofe, R-Okla., and Richard Burr, R-N.C., were hit with allegations of selling large amounts of stocks before the crisis rocked Wall Street. Loeffler, whose husband, Jeffrey Sprecher, sits as the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, sold stock Jan. 24—the same day she sat in on a briefing from two members of Trump’s Coronavirus Task Force, according to a Daily Beast report. Between that day and Feb. 14, the couple sold stock worth a total between $1.2 million and $3.1 million, the report said. In addition to the sales, they also purchased stock in a maker of software that helps people work at home – just before millions of Americans were forced to leave their offices because of the outbreak, the report said. If allegations that she used inside congressional information to benefit her stock portfolio are true, Loeffler could have violated the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, also known as the STOCK Act, passed in 2012, which makes it illegal for members of Congress to engage in insider trading. Loeffler, though, fired back Friday, denying the allegations and saying they are ""absolutely false."" ""If you actually look at the personal transaction reports that were filed, it notices at the bottom that I'm only informed of my transactions after they occur -- several weeks,"" Loeffler explained on Fox News' ""America's Newsroom."" ""So, certainly, those transactions -- at least on my behalf -- were a mix of buys and sells. Very routine for my portfolio,"" she continued. Loeffler told Fox News on Friday that she was not involved in decisions around buying and selling, which are outsourced to third-party advisers. ""There is a range of different decisions made every day with regard to my savings and 401(k) portfolios that I am not involved in. And, certainly, like any other trade: you can't see into the future,"" Loeffler said. ""I understand these rules and I have adhered to the letter and the spirit of these ethics rules,""  she added, noting that she welcomes an ethics investigation into the matter and will answer any questions. Loeffler was appointed to the Senate in December by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp after incumbent Sen. Johnny Isakson resigned over health issues, despite allies of President Trump having urged Kemp to select Collins instead. Collins, who recently self-quarantined after contact with a coronavirus patient, had announced his Senate bid for Loeffler’s seat in January and faced a stunning rebuke from the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which slammed him for what they called an ill-advised and self-centered bid for higher office. “The shortsightedness in this decision is stunning,"" NRSC Executive Director Kevin McLaughlin said in a statement in January, ""Doug Collins’ selfishness will hurt David Perdue, Kelly Loeffler, and President Trump. Not to mention the people of Georgia who stand to bear the burden of it for years to come. All he has done is put two senate seats, multiple house seats, and Georgia’s 16 electoral votes in play. The NRSC stands firmly behind Sen. Kelly Loeffler and urges anyone who wants to re-elect President Trump, hold the GOP senate majority, and stop socialism to do the same.” The party infrastructure has largely rallied to Loeffler's side, concerned that Collins' bid could complicate Republicans' chances given the state's unique ""jungle primary"" system where candidates from all parties compete on the same ballot. The NRSC did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment on the allegations against Loeffler Friday, referring to her comments on ""America's Newsroom.""

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced Friday that the deadline for filing federal taxes will move from April 15 to July 15 -- a move to ease the burden the coronavirus outbreak has put on individuals and the economy. ""At @realDonaldTrump’s direction, we are moving Tax Day from April 15 to July 15. All taxpayers and businesses will have this additional time to file and make payments without interest or penalties,"" he tweeted. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW RISK OF 'DEADLY' CYBERATTACK LOOMS AMID CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK He clarified that taxpayers could still file for refunds now, tweeting: ""I encourage all taxpayers who may have tax refunds to file now to get your money."" The move had been expected in some form since earlier this month. President Trump addressed the change in his daily coronavirus task force briefing. ""Hopefully by that time we'll have people getting back to their lives,"" Trump said. ""Families and businesses will have this extra time to file with no interest or penalties."" He continued: ""However if you have refunds or credits you would like to claim, you may still file. In other words you can file early if you are owed money by the IRS."" The administration had announced earlier in the week that it would delay the payments, a move that Mnuchin said would leave $300 billion in the economy at a critical time. By extending the filing deadline, the government is essentially allowing individuals and businesses to hold on to their money as they deal with lost revenue or paychecks resulting from the economic slowdown as federal and state governments try to keep people home so they don't spread the coronavirus. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  The move comes as Congress and the administration hash out details for a massive stimulus package that, among other things, could send checks worth as much as $1,200 to qualifying individuals amid the crisis, as layoffs mount and more economic uncertainty awaits. The draft legislation, obtained by Fox News, would provide minimum payments of $600, and aid would be phased down at adjusted gross income thresholds of $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 per couple. Additionally, there would be $500 payments for each child. The rebate amount is slated to then be reduced by $5 for each $100 a taxpayer’s income exceeds the legislation's threshold. The amount is therefore reduced to zero for single taxpayers with incomes exceeding $99,000 and $198,000 for joint filers. The IRS would determine income based on taxpayers' 2018 tax returns, or 2019 tax returns in cases where there is no 2018 return.

"                          A look at what's in&nbsp;Bernie Sanders' coronavirus plan Sen. Bernie Sanders is urging that Medicare cover all health care expenses tied to the coronavirus pandemic that’s sweeping the nation. The progressive senator from Vermont and Democratic presidential candidate tweeted Friday: “Right now, 87 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured. Our profit-driven health care system is a danger to our people. During this crisis, Medicare should cover all health care treatment for free, including coronavirus testing, treatment, and the eventual vaccine.” Sanders was responding to a story from Time that said: “An uninsured COVID-19 patient just got her medical bill: $34,927.43.” THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK Under a bipartisan bill passed by Congress and signed into law by President Trump this week, testing for the virus that causes the disease known as COVID-19 is free, but patients are still on the hook for a substantial portion of their treatments. Sanders has repeatedly argued the past couple of weeks – as the pandemic has spread across the country, forcing many Americans to huddle in their homes – that the outbreak illustrates the urgent need for a government-run single-payer ""Medicare-for-all"" health care system that he’s long championed. Sanders' presidential campaign announced that the senator would hold a virtual roundtable discussion on “the economic and health crises created by the coronavirus outbreak” at 7 p.m. ET. Last week, both Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden gave addresses outlining their plans to combat the pandemic and help the millions of Americans and small and large businesses crippled by the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus. On Tuesday, Sanders also released a set of principles for responding to the crisis. The senator’s calling for doubling a $1 trillion economic stimulus plan being discussed on Friday by the Senate. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW Sanders is also mulling his next political move – after a string of devastating losses on Tuesday at the hands of the former vice president. Sanders’ campaign on Wednesday emphasized that “the next primary contest is at least three weeks away. Sen. Sanders is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign.” Biden’s landslide victory in Florida, his crushing defeat of Sanders in Illinois, and his win in Arizona cemented his status as the presumptive Democratic nominee and all but closed the senator’s extremely narrow path to win the nomination. The Sanders campaign quickly stopped putting up Facebook ads and also stopped asking for contributions from supporters.

Dianne Feinstein of California and three of her Senate colleagues reported selling off stocks worth millions of dollars in the days before the coronavirus outbreak crashed the market, according to reports. The data is listed on a U.S. Senate website containing financial disclosures from Senate members. Feinstein, who serves as ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and her husband sold between $1.5 million and $6 million in stock in California biotech company Allogene Therapeutics, between Jan. 31 and Feb. 18, The New York Times reported. SENS. RICHARD BURR, KELLY LOEFFLER SOLD MILLIONS IN STOCK BEFORE CORONAVIRUS CRIPPLED MARKETS, REPORTS FIND Feinstein defended herself in a series of tweets on Friday, saying she has ""no control"" over her assets and the stocks in question were her husband's transactions. ""During my Senate career I’ve held all assets in a blind trust of which I have no control. Reports that I sold any assets are incorrect, as are reports that I was at a January 24 briefing on coronavirus, which I was unable to attend,"" she tweeted. ""Under Senate rules I report my husband's financial transactions. I have no input into his decisions. My husband in January and February sold shares of a cancer therapy company. This company is unrelated to any work on the coronavirus and the sale was unrelated to the situation."" When questioned by the newspaper, a spokesman for the Democrat from San Francisco also said Feinstein wasn’t directly involved in the sale. “All of Senator Feinstein’s assets are in a blind trust,” the spokesman, Tom Mentzer, told the Times. “She has no involvement in her husband’s financial decisions.” “All of Senator Feinstein’s assets are in a blind trust.

(Associated Press)       Reports identified the three other senators as Richard Burr of North Carolina, Kelly Loeffler of Georgia and James Inhofe of Oklahoma, all Republicans. Burr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, used more than 30 transactions to dump between $628,000 and $1.72 million on Feb. 13, according to ProPublica. The report said the transactions involved a significant percentage of the senator’s holdings and took place about a week before the impact of the virus outbreak sent stock prices plunging to the point where gains made during President Trump’s term in office were largely erased. “Senator Burr filed a financial disclosure form for personal transactions made several weeks before the U.S. and financial markets showed signs of volatility due to the growing coronavirus outbreak,” a Burr spokesperson said. “As the situation continues to evolve daily, he has been deeply concerned by the steep and sudden toll this pandemic is taking on our economy.” On Friday, the senator tweeted an updated statement saying he relied only on ""public news reports"" to guide his decision on the sale. Still, he said he's asked for a Senate Ethics Committee review of his actions. Burr was an author of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, a law that helps determine the federal response to situations such as the coronavirus outbreak, ProPublica reported. Burr’s office would not comment on what kind of information Burr might have received about coronavirus prior to his stock sales, the outlet reported. NPR reported that Burr made ominous comments about coronavirus behind closed doors last month. “There’s one thing that I can tell you about this: It is much more aggressive in its transmission than anything that we have seen in recent history,” Burr said at a Feb. 27 meeting of business leaders in Washington. “It is probably more akin to the 1918 pandemic.” Loeffler was appointed to the Senate in December by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp after incumbent Sen. Johnny Isakson resigned because of health issues – despite allies of President Trump having urged Kemp to select Rep. Doug Collins instead. Loeffler and her husband, Jeffrey Sprecher, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, sold stock Jan. 24, the same day she sat in on a briefing from two members of Trump’s Coronavirus Task Force, The Daily Beast reported. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Between that day and Feb. 14, the couple sold stock worth a total between $1.2 million and $3.1 million, the report said. In addition to the sales, they also purchased stock in a maker of software that helps people work at home – just before millions of Americans were forced to leave their offices because of the outbreak, the report said. Loeffler slammed the Daily Beast report as a ""ridiculous and baseless attack"" in a pair of late-night tweets. ""This is a ridiculous and baseless attack. I do not make investment decisions for my portfolio. Investment decisions are made by multiple third-party advisors without my or my husband's knowledge or involvement,"" Loeffler wrote. ""As confirmed in the periodic transaction report to Senate Ethics, I was informed of these purchases and sales on February 16, 2020 — three weeks after they were made."" In an interview Friday with Fox News’ Ed Henry, Loeffler again said any claim of insider trading is “absolutely false.” She added, “I’m not involved in the decisions” of buying and selling, while saying she’d cooperate if any investigation is launched. Inhofe sold as much as $400,000 in stock all on Jan. 27, in companies such as PayPal, Apple and real estate company Brookfield Asset Management, The New York Times reported. But in a written statement, Inhofe pushed back by saying he was not at a late January briefing and, further, does not have involvement in investment choices. The statement said: “The New York Times allegations are completely baseless and 100 percent false. I was not at the briefing on January 24. I was meeting with pro-life kids from Oklahoma here for the March for Life and the new nominee to be U.S. Ambassador to Tanzania. I do not have any involvement in my investment decisions. In December 2018, shortly after becoming chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I instructed my financial advisor to move me out of all stocks and into mutual funds to avoid any appearance of controversy.

"                          Mike Tobin reports from Chicago on why the state decided not to postpone voting. With the coronavirus outbreak forcing states with upcoming presidential primaries to postpone their elections, there’s growing concern that the pandemic that’s sweeping the nation and forcing many Americans to hunker down in their homes could severely impact November’s general election. A new study from the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice spotlights sweeping changes to current voting practices across the country – such as universal mail-in voting, ballot drive-by drop off boxes from coast to coast, and easier online voter registration – to make voting in November safe. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW But the authors of the study urge that “implementing that plan must begin now” in order “to ensure that the pandemic does not prevent a free and fair election.” And the plan isn’t cheap – with a price tag at roughly $2 billion. One of the biggest costs would be sending and receiving ballots by mail – which should be covered by the U.S. Postal Service. The study estimates a price tag between $413 million and $593 million. And printing all those extra ballots would add another $54 billion to $89 billion to the bill. Another big-ticket item would be the construction and maintenance of ballot boxes – where voters could drop off their mail-in ballots and avoid person-to-person contact. The study estimates a price tag of up to $167 million. Four states — California, Colorado, Oregon and Washington — already have drop-off ballot boxes.       Chicago residents line up for early voting at the Roden Library Monday, March 16, 2020, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast)       Improvements in ballot processing would also increase the cost. The survey spells out that “some jurisdictions will need to purchase resources that include signature verification technology, high-volume mail processing and sorting equipment, and high-speed ballot scanners.” The cost is estimated from a low of $120 million to a high of $240 million. And they point to another $92 million for more space for ballot processing and storage. The study also suggests an additional $240 million to make in-person polling stations safer for voters and election officials and volunteers. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK  The authors of the Brennan Center study urged that “state officials, advocates, and citizens should take steps to reassure citizens that voting will be safe and to guard against the use of Covid-19 to suppress voters or otherwise manipulate the election.” Americans will vote for president, control of the Senate and House of Representatives, governorships, state legislative and executive offices and more in November’s general election.

"                          Doctors and nurses are increasingly working without proper masks, gowns and eye gear in the face of a supply shortage; Mike Tobin reports. The left is never apt to let a serious crisis go to waste, as we see with its daily use of the coronavirus pandemic to bash the Republican administration. The bigger danger is the efforts it is already making to exploit the panic for its longer-term goal of destroying U.S. capitalism. Socialist Bernie Sanders led the charge last Sunday in his Democratic primary debate with Joe Biden. Bernie rolled out his usual themes, this time through the virus lens. The pandemic “exposes the incredible weakness and dysfunctionality” of the U.S. health system, he said; the cure is centralized, socialized care. Americans can’t get the drugs they need because “a bunch of crooks” run drug companies, “ripping us off every single day.” The virus exposes the “cruelty and unjustness” of an economy that allows “big-money interests” and “multimillionaires” to profiteer off “working families.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER He’s hardly alone. The coronavirus has “laid this bare: America was less prepared for a pandemic than countries with a universal health system,” declared Vox. The pandemic has “inflicted new stress on a system already too unequal to function,” wrote Sarah Jones in New York magazine, lecturing on the need to “devolve power from wealthy interests.” “The coronavirus crisis exposes the stupidity of Trump’s healthcare policies,” railed Los Angeles Times columnist Michael Hiltzik. A Morning Consult poll suggests this opportunistic sloganeering is resonating, with 41% of the public more likely to support universal health-care proposals amid this pandemic.

"                          President Trump announces he has suspended student loan payments without penalty for at least 60 days, and he's moving tax day to July 15, 2020 The Trump administration on Friday announced sweeping new travel restrictions between U.S. and Mexico in the latest step by the administration to curb the spread of the coronavirus -- halting non-essential travel and moving to turn back any illegal immigrants trying to enter the country. ""The United States and Mexico have agreed to restrict non-essential travel across our shared border,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at a White House press briefing. Officials emphasized that the restrictions would not affect lawful trade and commerce, as the administration seeks to keep the economic supply chain going amid the ongoing crisis. Moments later, Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf announced that the Center for Disease Control has directed DHS to ""suspend the introduction of all individuals without proper documentation"" into the U.S. from both the north and southern borders. Those entering the country illegally between the ports of entry are frequently detained for a period of time, particularly if they claim asylum. But under this policy, they will be sent back immediately and not detained in a center where they could possibly spread or catch the highly contagious virus. TRUMP ANNOUNCES SUSPENSION OF FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS, STANDARDIZED TESTING REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE OF CORONAVIRUS Wolf said the restrictions will go into place at midnight tonight, and that anyone caught entering the country illegally would immediately be returned to Mexico, Canada or a number of other countries from where they have originated. The restrictions come amid fears that a wave of migration could bring disease and overwhelm the American healthcare system. “These measures will protect the health of all three nations and reduce the incentive for mass global migration that would badly deplete the healthcare resources needed for our people,” President Trump said at the beginning of the briefing. Trump has slapped travel bans on China, Iran and the European Union. This week, Trump announced that the U.S. and Canada had agreed to stop all non-essential travel across the border -- that also goes into effect at midnight. Trump said Friday the crisis threatens to “create a perfect storm that would spread infections to our border agents, migrants, and to the public at large. Left unchecked this would cripple our system, overwhelm the health care system and threaten national security -- we’re not going to let that happen.” It's one of a host of measures by the administration to combat the spread of the virus. A number of states have imposed significant restrictions on daily life. California and New York have issued orders for residents to stay at home, and businesses and schools have closed across the country. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The administration is also seeking to provide economic relief to Americans affected by the crisis. The Senate appears to be nearing agreement on a $1 trillion stimulus package that includes sending checks to Americans. Trump on Friday confirmed that Tax Day is being shifted to July 15.

"                          President Trump announces he has suspended student loan payments without penalty for at least 60 days, and he's moving tax day to July 15, 2020 President Trump on Friday announced that the administration would allow federal student loan borrowers to suspend their payments without penalty for at least 60 days, and that standardized test requirements would not be enforced for elementary and high school students amid the coronavirus pandemic. The president announced earlier this week that he had waived interest on federal student loans “until further notice,” but took that measure to the next level Friday by suspending payments. SENATE DEMS PROPOSE SUSPENDING STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS AMID CORONAVIRUS “We’ve temporarily waived all interest on federally held student loans,” Trump said during a Coronavirus Task Force press conference Friday at the White House. “They’ll be very happy to hear that and I’ve instructed them to take that action immediately.” “Today, Betsy Devos directed federal lenders to allow borrowers to suspend their student loans and loan payments without penalty for at least the next 60 days, and if we need more we’ll extend that period of time,” Trump said. “Borrowers should contact their lenders, but we’ve given them very strong instructions,” Trump added. “That’s a big thing, that’s going to make a lot of students very happy.” Trump also announced Friday that there will be no enforcement of scheduled standardized testing for high school and elementary school-aged students. “There will be no standardized testing,” Trump said. “A lot of students will be happy. Some, probably not.” The president’s announcement on student loans comes after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and other top Senate Democrats rolled out legislation that would cancel student loan payments for the duration of the coronavirus national emergency. That plan would provide relief to federal student loan borrowers through an “immediate cancellation” of monthly student loan payments during the national emergency, and would “pay down a minimum of $10K for all federal student loan borrowers.” The plan would also require Congress to authorize the Department of Education to make monthly student loan payments on behalf of borrowers, and would “guarantee” the minimum of $10,000 payoff for all borrowers. TRUMP ADMIN, LAWMAKERS HUDDLE TO NEGOTIATE MASSIVE $1T STIMULUS, AMID CORONAVIRUS CRISIS The suspension of payments would be considered a new policy, separate from the deferment and forbearance options that currently exist for borrowers. The plan would also make all payments made by the Department of Education “tax-free” for borrowers. It is unclear, at this point, if Schumer’s legislation will be folded into the massive stimulus plan currently under negotiation on Capitol Hill. Meanwhile, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the president also announced Friday that he had postponed the tax filing day from April 15 to July 15. As of Friday morning, the U.S. had more than 14,250 confirmed cases of coronavirus in all 50 states, including Washington, D.C. The U.S., so far, has seen 205 COVID-19-related deaths.

"                          At least nine Democrat senators have to get on board to push the $1 trillion package across the finish line; Griff Jenkins reports from Washington. As federal, state and local governments scramble to help hospitals and doctors' offices deal with a looming shortage of supplies -- including personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care providers treating patients infected with the coronavirus -- Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, is introducing a bill that would redirect hundreds of millions of dollars ""just sitting around"" to help buy up equipment. Ernst is proposing that the federal government raid the ""outdated"" Presidential Election Campaign Fund, which currently holds over $350 million, to finance its efforts to prepare the U.S. health care system for a jump in demand linked to the coronavirus pandemic. ""As I’ve said, it’s going to take an all hands on deck approach to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. I’ve heard directly from Iowa state officials and our health care providers about the need for additional masks and personal protective equipment,"" Ernst said in a statement. ""Right now, there’s more than $350 million in unused cash sitting around in the obsolete and outdated presidential election campaign fund. This is simple. We should immediately move that money to where it’s critically needed: let’s put it toward more masks and personal protective equipment for the health care workers who are on the front lines of this pandemic."" CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW TRUMP EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE NEW TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS BETWEEN US AND MEXICO, CANADA The fund was set up by a law that allows presidential candidates to accept a set amount of federal money to run their campaigns, a move that was meant to reduce the effect of special interests in presidential elections. Candidates running in a primary can receive matching funds for their campaign donations as long as they agree to comply with spending limits and a general election candidate can get a grant of about $100 million from the fund as long as he or she agrees to take no private funding for the general election. The fund is financed by taxpayers who have the option on their tax form each year to contribute $3 to it. The law has fallen out of use due to how expensive presidential elections have become, with candidates preferring to solicit private donations as they build war chests that far exceed the spending limits for Presidential Election Campaign Fund money. The only candidates to use public funds in 2016 were Democrat Martin O'Malley and Green Party candidate Jill Stein. O'Malley took just over $1 million for his primary campaign and Stein received just over $450,000 for hers. Stein did not use public funds for her general election campaign. Former President Barack Obama was the first candidate since 1976 to forego the public financing -- and spending limits -- for his 2008 general election campaign, and his opponent John McCain was the last candidate to use the financing.       Then-U.S. Senator Barack Obama, D-Ill., (L) with wife Michelle (R), waves after formally announcing his campaign for U.S. President in the 2008 election during a campaign rally in front of the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois, February 10, 2007. REUTERS/Frank Polich        CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP That's why Ernst sees an opportunity to inject hundreds of millions of dollars into the federal government's coronavirus response without increasing the federal deficit or charging taxpayers. She proposes that the money go to the Department of Health and Human Services' Strategic National Stockpile, which is working on obtaining PPE and providing it to health care workers. Ernst's $350 million will just be a drop in the bucket of overall federal spending on the coronavirus threat, however. Congress has already passed and President Trump has already signed two laws totaling upwards of $108 billion for preventing the spread of the coronavirus and stimulating the economy. Now, Congress is working on a bill that could spend more than $1 trillion on the coronavirus response. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he hopes to have an agreement with Democratic leaders on the bill by Friday night and hopes to pass it by Monday.    ",         Sen.

"                          Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell introduces latest package addressing coronavirus economic relief. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and members of President Trump’s economic team are huddling with lawmakers on Capitol Hill Friday as he continues negotiations with Senate Republicans and Democrats over the massive, $1 trillion-plus stimulus package amid the coronavirus outbreak. Mnuchin and Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow were meeting with Senate leaders behind closed doors to discuss the latest GOP draft legislation rolled out Thursday by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who hopes to work through the weekend to solidify a plan. MCCONNELL'S CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS PLAN WOULD PROVIDE PAYMENTS OF $1200 PER PERSON McConnell explained Friday that the Senate has broken up into four bipartisan groups to work on different aspects of the bill. “I’ve tasked these bipartisan teams to reach an agreement by the end of the day today, midnight,” McConnell said Friday. “We’ll need Saturday to be drafting what we can agree to. And because of the procedural hurdles you have to jump through in the Senate.” McConnell said that he has received direction from Mnuchin and the administration that the measure should be passed by Monday. “That gives you a timeline of what we’re working on through the weekend,” McConnell said. The draft legislation, obtained by Fox News, would provide payments up to $1,200 per person. They would be phased down at adjusted gross income thresholds of $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 per couple. Additionally, there would be $500 payments for each child. The amount, though, is slated to then be reduced by $5 for each $100 a taxpayer’s income exceeds the legislation’s threshold. The amount is reduced to zero for single taxpayers with incomes exceeding $99,000 and $198,000 for joint filers. The legislation also outlined $300 billion for small businesses to keep furloughed and laid-off workers on the payroll and $208 billion in loans to airlines and other industries. READ REPUBLICANS SECTION-BY-SECTION SUMMARY OF THE BILL But McConnell currently may not have enough support to push the legislation through at this point. Some Republicans have objected to certain measures outlined in the bill, and most Democrats say the measure does not go far enough. ""We are beginning to review Senator McConnell's proposal and on first reading, it is not at all pro-worker and instead puts corporations way ahead of workers,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a joint statement. The Democratic leaders said, however, their priority is to ""make sure all workers are protected from the loss of a paycheck or that no family falls into financial ruin because of this pandemic.” Trump, on Wednesday, signed the second coronavirus relief bill into law that provides paid sick leave, unemployment help and free testing to Americans. The legislation provides 14 days of paid sick days to workers affected by the coronavirus, ensures free testing to everyone, including the uninsured, and expands food aid and boosts unemployment dollars to states. The House and Senate already passed a bipartisan $8.3 billion package to prop up the health care system to prepare for the influx of sick Americans. The second response bill that was signed into law Wednesday aims to bring relief to workers who lost their jobs and families at home for illnesses, quarantines or caring for kids whose schools have shuttered. Meanwhile, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Mnuchin announced Friday that, at the direction of the president, he had postponed the tax filing day from April 15 to July 15. As of Friday morning, the U.S. had more than 14,250 confirmed cases of coronavirus in all 50 states, including Washington, D.C. The U.S., so far, has seen 205 COVID-19-related deaths.

"                          Senators selling stocks before the coronavirus pandemic rocked the markets have renewed attention on something called the STOCK Act. Here's what you need to know. Reports of multiple senators selling stocks before the coronavirus pandemic rocked the markets have renewed attention on something called the STOCK Act. The STOCK Act is a law that was passed in 2012 that says members of Congress and other government employees, including congressional staffers and members of the executive branch and judiciary, are not allowed to engage in insider trading based off information they learn through their jobs. If there are any legal consequences for the current controversy, this law would be at the center of it. Here's what to know: Votes in Congress The STOCK Act passed the House 417-2 and the Senate 96-3. It was signed by former President Barack Obama on April 4, 2012. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW FOUR SENATORS SOLD OFF STOCKS BEFORE CORONAVIRUS CRASH: REPORTS Sponsor Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., who retired just months after the passage of the STOCK Act, was the bill's chief sponsor.       Sen. Joseph Lieberman, I-Conn., speaks on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, May 5, 2010. (AP)       MINNESOTA MAN RECOVERING FROM CORONAVIRUS: 'I DIDN'T EVEN THINK IT WAS ANYTHING' What does it do?  The STOCK Act explicitly states that ""members of Congress and congressional employees"" are forbidden from using the nonpublic information they learn through their jobs ""as a means for making a private profit,"" according to a Congressional Research Service summary of the bill. It specifically changes two insider trading laws that were previously on the books but exempted congressional members and employees. Additionally, the law requires certain financial disclosures not only from those working in the legislative branch, but also from the president, the vice president, executive branch employees, judges and more. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Full name The longer name for the STOCK Act is the ""Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012."" Has it been changed?  In 2013, about one year after the STOCK Act's passage, Obama signed a change to the law that had been quietly ushered through Congress. It got rid of a provision that the financial disclosures required by the law be posted online on official websites.

"                          President Trump announces he has suspended student loan payments without penalty for at least 60 days, and he's moving tax day to July 15, 2020 The Trump administration on Friday announced sweeping new travel restrictions between U.S. and Mexico in the latest step to curb the spread of the coronavirus — it halted non-essential travel and moved to turn back any illegal immigrants trying to enter the country. ""The United States and Mexico have agreed to restrict non-essential travel across our shared border,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said during a White House press briefing with other top officials. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, LAWMAKERS HUDDLE TO NEGOTIATE MASSIVE $1T STIMULUS, AMID CORONAVIRUS CRISIS Officials emphasized that the restrictions would not affect lawful trade and commerce, as the administration seeks to keep the economic supply chain going amid the ongoing crisis. Moments later, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf announced that the Centers for Disease Control has directed the Department of Homeland Security to ""suspend the introduction of all individuals without proper documentation"" into the U.S. from both the northern and southern borders. Those entering the country illegally between the ports of entry are frequently detained for a period of time, particularly if they claim asylum. But under this policy, they will be sent back immediately and not detained in a center where they could possibly spread or catch the highly contagious virus. TRUMP ANNOUNCES SUSPENSION OF FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS, STANDARDIZED TESTING REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE OF CORONAVIRUS Wolf said the restrictions will go into place at midnight tonight, and that anyone caught entering the country illegally would immediately be returned to Mexico, Canada or a number of other countries from where they have originated. The restrictions come amid fears that a wave of migration could bring disease and overwhelm the American health care system. “These measures will protect the health of all three nations and reduce the incentive for mass global migration that would badly deplete the health care resources needed for our people,” President Trump said. Also during Friday's press conference, Trump announced that the administration would allow federal student loan borrowers to suspend their payments without penalty for at least 60 days, and that standardized test requirements would not be enforced for elementary and high school students amid the coronavirus pandemic. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The press conference threatened to get derailed on a number of occasions. The president objected to one question by NBC News reporter Peter Alexander that he deemed ""nasty"" and called him a ""terrible reporter."" That led to a number of other reporters choosing instead to use their questions to ask both Trump and Pompeo about that remark. Trump refused to back off. In another unusual moment, former press secretary Sean Spicer was called on to ask Trump a question. Trump has slapped travel bans on China, Iran and the European Union. This week, Trump announced that the U.S. and Canada had agreed to stop all non-essential travel across the border -- that also goes into effect at midnight. Trump said Friday the crisis threatens to “create a perfect storm that would spread infections to our border agents, migrants, and to the public at large. Left unchecked this would cripple our system, overwhelm the health care system and threaten national security."" A number of states have imposed significant restrictions on daily life. California and New York have issued orders for residents to stay at home, and businesses and schools have closed across the country. The administration is also seeking to provide economic relief to Americans affected by the crisis. The Senate appears to be nearing agreement on a $1 trillion stimulus package that includes sending checks to Americans. Trump on Friday confirmed that Tax Day is being shifted to July 15. As of Friday morning, the U.S. had 14,250 confirmed cases of coronavirus in all 50 states, including Washington, D.C. The U.S., so far, has seen 205 COVID-19-related deaths.

"                          The deadline for filing federal taxes will move from April 15 to July 15. The announcement was made to ease the burden the coronavirus outbreak has put on individuals and the economy. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced Friday that the deadline for filing federal taxes will move from April 15 to July 15 -- a move to ease the burden the coronavirus outbreak has put on individuals and the economy. ""At @realDonaldTrump’s direction, we are moving Tax Day from April 15 to July 15. All taxpayers and businesses will have this additional time to file and make payments without interest or penalties,"" he tweeted. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW RISK OF 'DEADLY' CYBERATTACK LOOMS AMID CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK He clarified that taxpayers could still file for refunds now, tweeting: ""I encourage all taxpayers who may have tax refunds to file now to get your money."" The move had been expected in some form since earlier this month. President Trump addressed the change in his daily coronavirus task force briefing. ""Hopefully by that time we'll have people getting back to their lives,"" Trump said. ""Families and businesses will have this extra time to file with no interest or penalties."" He continued: ""However if you have refunds or credits you would like to claim, you may still file. In other words you can file early if you are owed money by the IRS."" The administration had announced earlier in the week that it would delay the payments, a move that Mnuchin said would leave $300 billion in the economy at a critical time. By extending the filing deadline, the government is essentially allowing individuals and businesses to hold on to their money as they deal with lost revenue or paychecks resulting from the economic slowdown as federal and state governments try to keep people home so they don't spread the coronavirus. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  The move comes as Congress and the administration hash out details for a massive stimulus package that, among other things, could send checks worth as much as $1,200 to qualifying individuals amid the crisis, as layoffs mount and more economic uncertainty awaits. The draft legislation, obtained by Fox News, would provide minimum payments of $600, and aid would be phased down at adjusted gross income thresholds of $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 per couple.

The amount is therefore reduced to zero for single taxpayers with incomes exceeding $99,000 and $198,000 for joint filers.

The Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, who had expressed confidence in the country’s preparedness for the pandemic, sold a significant share of his stocks last month, according to public disclosures. Burr said he relied solely on public news reports for the sales but asked Senate Ethics Chairman James Lankford (R-Okla.) for a review. ‘Understanding the assumption many could make in hindsight however, I spoke this morning with the Chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee and asked him to open a complete review of the matter with full transparency,’ Burr said in a statement. The sales included stocks in hotels and restaurants, shipping, drug manufacturing and health care, records show. In his statement, Burr said he had relied specifically on ‘CNBC’s daily health and science reporting out of its Asia bureaus.’”Senate newbie Kelly Loeffler also sold off stocks - Daily Beast: “The Senate’s newest member sold off seven figures’ worth of stock holdings in the days and weeks after a private, all-senators meeting on the novel coronavirus that subsequently hammered U.S. equities. Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) reported the first sale of stock jointly owned by her and her husband on Jan. 24, the very day that her committee, the Senate Health Committee, hosted a private, all-senators briefing from administration officials, including the CDC director and Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on the coronavirus. … That first transaction was a sale of stock in the company Resideo Technologies valued at between $50,001 and $100,000. The company’s stock price has fallen by more than half since then… It was the first of 29 stock transactions that Loeffler and her husband made through mid-February, all but two of which were sales.”Inhofe and Feinstein, too - NY Post: “Two more senators made hefty stock sales before the coronavirus pandemic tanked global markets, records revealed as two other lawmakers who dumped millions in shares faced mounting calls to resign. Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Jim Inhofe sold as much as $6.4 million worth of stock in the weeks before panic about the coronavirus sparked a worldwide selloff, according to disclosure filings… Feinstein, a California Democrat, sold $500,001 to $1 million worth of stock in a company called Allogene Therapeutics on Jan. 31, less than a month before panic about the virus caused markets to plunge, Senate records show. Her husband sold $1,000,001 to $5 million worth of Allogene shares on Feb. 18, according to financial disclosures. And Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican, dumped as much as $400,000 worth of stock on Jan. 27, records show. He sold shares in five different companies including Apple, PayPal and Brookfield Asset Management, according to a disclosure report.”Administration seeks to keep economic bad news under wraps - WSJ: “The Trump administration asked states to abstain from releasing unemployment claims fig­ures prior to the publication of a national compilation of weekly U.S. jobless claims, according to a state labor department official. The official cited an email sent on Wednesday from Gay Gilbert, an administrator at the U.S. Labor Department. ... The emailed message asked states to keep the numbers embargoed until the national claims figures are released each Thursday, the state official said. The number of Americans applying for first time unemployment benefits jumped last week in a spike tied to the coronavirus pandemic, increasing by 70,000 to 281,000, the fourth biggest weekly increase on record go­ing back to 1967. State level anecdotes suggest jobless claims could hit more than 2 million in next Thursday’s report, an unprecedented level, according to a note from Goldman Sachs.”THE RULEBOOK: ROCK SOLID“A FIRM Union will be of the utmost moment to the peace and liberty of the States, as a barrier against domestic faction and insurrection.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 9TIME OUT: BEST POLITICAL BOOKS LISTSo it’s been a week, and you’re starting to get a little bit of ranch fever. Okay, maybe a lot. You’re following the good advice to keep some structure in your day, especially if there are younger ones around. You’re attending to your intellectual, physical and spiritual needs, getting plenty of fresh air and going to bed before 11 o’clock. But you still feel the strains of isolation and loss of routine. So read a book! Not just any book, but a world-class book that will hold your attention, expand your mind and transport you to someplace else entirely. There are lots of lists of great books out there for generalists. But what about political books? Glad you asked... Here is the Halftime Report’s latest and greatest list of the best political books to read:“Shelley’s Heart” by Charles McCarry (1995) - This remains, by our lights, the best novel about Washington and American politics ever written. When you realize how much of what McCarry wrote about politics was prophetic, it gets even better. It would be an engrossing thriller even without its political insights, but with them it’s just… *Italian chef kissing fingers emoji*“All the King’s Men” by Robert Penn Warren (1946) - You know the “king” in this novel, Willie Stark, better as his real-world inspiration, Louisiana’s dictatorial governor of the 1930s, Huey Long. Warren’s writing is so good and his characters so real that you will practically smell the acrid cigar smoke and whiskey in the back room of Slade’s Pool Hall. If you never read it -- or never gave it a chance as required reading in school -- you owe it to yourself. “Brave New World” by Aldus Huxley (1931) - Huxley’s vision of a 26th century world free from want and dedicated to the pursuit of personal happiness fueled by prescription drugs must have seemed utterly bizarre to his contemporaries. But with each passing decade, his vision of a rigidly enforced social code and the dangers of a mob mentality have come to seem more and more prescient. “The Gay Place” by Billy Lee Brammer (1962) - Brammer was a Texas newspaperman who joined the staff of then-Sen. Lyndon Johnson as he was reaching the pinnacle of his power in the Senate. The book is a collection of three novellas that beautifully, achingly capture the world of hacks and flacks in post-WWII Texas with all their human frailty. It was the only work Brammer, a tragic figure himself, ever completed.“Bonfire of the Vanities” by Tom Wolfe (1987) - We know this isn’t a political book, per se. But boy is it a great insight on the way the world of politics functions. Wolfe’s masterwork, set in the heady days of mid-1980s Manhattan, provides amazing insight on the way racial politics, media muckraking, politicians' opportunism and cultural trends shape the way we are governed.   Flag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARDESTIMATED DELEGATES FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATIONBiden: 1,184Sanders: 885[Ed. note: 1,991 delegates needed to win]TRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE Average approval: 43.8 percentAverage disapproval: 51.8 percentNet Score: -8 percentChange from one week ago: ↑ 0.4 points[Average includes: NPR/PBS News/Marist: 43% approve - 50% disapprove; NBC News/WSJ: 46% approve - 51% disapprove; Gallup: 44% approve - 52% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 41% approve - 54% disapprove; CNN: 45% approve - 52% disapprove.]WANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT? You can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

Cuomo told New York’s 19 million residents to stay indoors as much as possible and ordered nonessential businesses to keep all of their workers home. The measures, the state’s most drastic yet, come as confirmed coronavirus cases in New York topped 7,000, by far the most in the nation. ‘These provisions will be enforced,’ the governor said at a briefing in Albany. ‘These are not helpful hints.’ They will take effect Sunday night. Even as he told New Yorkers to stay indoors, Mr. Cuomo added that if they did go out — whether to do essential shopping or to exercise — they must stay six feet away from each other.”Newsom orders California’s nearly 40 millions residents to stay home -  Sacramento Bee: “All Californians need to stay at home and avoid nonessential social contact to slow the spread of the deadly coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered Thursday. ‘It’s time for all of us to recognize as individuals and as a community we need to do more to meet this moment,’ he said at an evening press conference. Newsom said he hopes not to have to enforce the order, instead encouraging Californians to influence one another to do the right thing. ‘I don’t believe the people of California need to be told through law enforcement to home isolate, protect themselves,’ he said. More than a quarter of the state’s residents were already under some type of shelter in place or stay at home orders, including in Sacramento County.”Federal travel ban expands - USA Today: “The U.S.-Mexico border will be closed to nonessential travel to further help stem the spread of the novel coronavirus, President Donald Trump announced Friday. ‘As we did with Canada, we're also working with Mexico to implement new rules at our ports of entry to suspend non-essential travel,’ Trump said. ‘These new rules and procedures will not impede lawful trade and commerce.’ Trump said that Mexico is also suspending air travel from Europe. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the U.S. has taken ‘two important steps’ this week to curb the spread of the virus. He noted the border closure with Canada, announced Wednesday, would go into effect at midnight. He said the closure would last 30 days and reiterated the news Trump shared that the border with Mexico would also close.”Governors clamor for more federal controls - Fox News: “Despite pleas from governors, members of Congress and presidential candidates, President Trump so far has resisted using his powers under the Defense Production Act as officials look to ramp up the American medical system's capacity in anticipation of a spike in demand due to the coronavirus pandemic. On Wednesday, Trump invoked the Defense Production Act… But as of Friday morning, he has not actually taken action under the law, tweeting Wednesday that he only signed the act ‘should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future. Hopefully there will be no need....’ That has concerned officials across the political spectrum who see an immediate need for things like personal protective equipment (PPE) for medical professionals who will be treating patients sick with the novel coronavirus. A potential shortage has concerned medical professionals and even led multiple TV medical dramas to donate the masks they use in their wardrobe to hospitals.”McConnell sets Monday deadline on stimulus deal - Bloomberg: “Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he wants the chamber to finish and pass a massive stimulus bill to bolster the economy by Monday -- lightning speed for legislation expected to top $1 trillion. McConnell, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin arrived at the Capitol Friday morning for a blitz of bipartisan negotiations, with all sides stressing the need to act fast. ‘I’ve tasked the bipartisan team to reach an agreement by the end of the day today,’ McConnell said at the Capitol. Getting a deal done Friday would give bill drafters Saturday to write up the text, with McConnell planning to start the process for teeing up votes on Monday. Eric Ueland, the White House legislative liaison, also stressed the need for speed. … He noted that Mnuchin said he wants Congress to complete action on the bill by Monday ‘to ensure that aid swiftly gets to the American people as well as to provide confidence with the American economy, and American markets.’”Plan has payments of $1,200 per person for middle class and poor - Fox News: “Saying lawmakers ‘need to take bold and swift action as soon as possible,’ Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday introduced legislation to provide as much as $1,200 per person and $2,400 per couple in the U.S. amid the coronavirus outbreak and skyrocketing jobless claims. The draft legislation, obtained by Fox News, would provide minimum payments of $600, and aid would be phased down at adjusted gross income thresholds of $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 per couple. Additionally, there would be $500 payments for each child. The rebate amount is slated to then be reduced by $5 for each $100 a taxpayer’s income exceeds the legislation's threshold. The amount is therefore reduced to zero for single taxpayers with incomes exceeding $99,000 and $198,000 for joint filers. The IRS would determine income based on taxpayers' 2018 tax returns, or 2019 tax returns in cases where there is no 2018 return...”Continetti: Coronavirus Tests America’s Social Capacity - Free Beacon: “A few months after September 11, 2001, David Brooks went back and looked at coverage of Pearl Harbor for an article in the Weekly Standard (‘After Pearl Harbor,’ December 10, 2001). … I revisited Brooks's article this week while thinking about the differences between America during the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-1919 and America during the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic today. … What changed is the American ethos. Expressive individualism replaced self-restraint. Narcissism and the therapeutic sensibility triumphed over the reticence and sense of tragedy that comes from living in places and times where there is no safety net and death is a constant presence. The culture of debunking, revisionism, and repudiation informs education, entertainment, art, and occasionally sport.”DEM WOMEN UNDER MICROSCOPE AS RUNNING MATES NYT: “[Former Vice President Joe Biden] has shown his hand in a big and unusual way for a front-runner, saying he would pick a woman as a running mate. That has opened the path for Democratic officials to start picking favorites — from a socially safe distance. In discussions with The Times since Mr. Biden’s big primary victories on Tuesday, 60 Democratic National Committee members and congressional and party leaders most frequently proposed three former rivals of Mr. Biden as his running mate — Senator Kamala Harris of California, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. Next up was Stacey Abrams, a former state House leader whose defeat in 2018 Georgia governor’s race remains disputed by many in the party. Other popular suggestions included Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Representative Val Demings of Florida. The Democrats interviewed also proposed seven other women, including Govs. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico.”Bloomy transfers $18 million from campaign to DNC - Politico: “Mike Bloomberg is sending $18 million from his defunct presidential campaign to the Democratic National Committee, a dramatic investment in the national party that appears to push the boundaries of campaign finance law. The money will support the DNC’s ‘Battleground Build-Up 2020’ program, the DNC’s initiative in 12 swing states across the country. The money could fund potentially hundreds of organizers in those swing states. ‘This will help us invest in more organizers across the country to elect the next president and help Democrats win up and down the ballot,’ DNC chairman Tom Perez said in a statement. ‘The DNC has made early, historic investments in our battleground and general election programs, and the additional organizers we're putting on the ground will significantly bolster those efforts and help make sure Donald Trump is a one-term president.’ The massive transfer signals a change of plans for Bloomberg, who is nixing an earlier idea to form his own super PAC to take on President Donald Trump in 2020.”Really going out on a limb… Gillibrand backs Biden - WaPo: “Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) threw her support behind former vice president Joe Biden on Thursday, joining a dozen other former competitors to back his bid to become the Democratic nominee for president. ‘He’s the absolute best candidate to defeat President Trump, and I think he is the person who has gained the trust and the respect of the American people in a way that no one else has,’ Gillibrand said in an interview with The Washington Post. ‘The truth is he’s run the strongest campaign.’”PLAY-BY-PLAYTrump’s temporary spy chief making big changes - WaPoA decade later, ObamaCare opposition falls to lowest level in poll - NBC NewsWSJ Editorial Board: Rethinking the Coronavirus Shutdown - WSJWashington Lt.

Would it imperil our democracy if we just said, ‘Never mind, don't bother,’ and directed our resources toward getting MLB back in business?” – Mary Carol Miller, Greenwood, Miss.[Ed. note: If I had my way, Dr. Miller, conventions would increase rather than decrease in importance. I’d do away with primaries and caucuses and have delegates chosen in conventions on the county, district and state level who would then be free to choose a nominee. But I also recognize that this year of pandemic presents some special challenges. Republicans don’t need a convention, having opted to rig the process to protect President Trump. But Democrats aren’t yet finished with their work and may need a convention to fill in gaps left by what has become a very uncertain primary process.

One Walmart customer didn't have a chance to get any of those groceries she came for, but she left with something much more special. ‘We were like oh my gosh, is this actually going to happen,’ said store manager Jessica Hinkle. Hinkle said the woman warned store associates that her last child came in just 30 minutes. When the woman's water broke in the toilet paper aisle, she was prepared to go into labor right then and there. ‘We were like what do we do now?’ she said. ‘Another lady comes around the corner and she says 'I'm a labor nurse, can I help?' and we said yes, yes please. She had gloves in her pocket [and] she was ready.’ Hinkle said she grabbed a sheet and blocked the aisle to give the woman as much privacy as possible. … Springfield firefighters rushed into the store and helped deliver the baby girl. ‘They're the typical fire department that shops in our store, so they were pretty proud of themselves,’ Hinkle said.

"                          President Trump announced he will invoke the Defense Production Act, which aims to better prepare the U.S. for the manufacturing and distribution of medical supplies amid coronavirus. Despite pleas from governors, members of Congress and presidential candidates, President Trump initially had resisted using his powers under the Defense Production Act as officials look to ramp up the American medical system's capacity in anticipation of a spike in demand due to the coronavirus pandemic. But the president then said Friday that he would in fact use the act to mobilize the private sector to provide medical equipment -- largely masks -- that health care professionals need to treat patients infected with the coronavirus. The Associated Press reported that Trump made the order to begin using the act after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer pleaded for him to do so on Friday. On Wednesday, Trump first invoked the Defense Production Act, the Korean War-era statute that allows the president to direct manufacturers to make certain equipment that is necessary for the United States to deal with a crisis, whether that be a war or a pandemic, in order ""to promote the national defense."" But as of Friday morning, he had not actually taken action under the law, tweeting Wednesday that he only signed the act ""should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future. Hopefully there will be no need...."" That concerned officials across the political spectrum who see an immediate need for things like personal protective equipment (PPE) for medical professionals who will be treating patients sick with the novel coronavirus. A potential shortage has concerned medical professionals and even led multiple TV medical dramas to donate the masks they use in their wardrobe to hospitals. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW TRUMP INVOKES DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT: WHAT IS IT? Trump was asked about what he might do under the Defense Production Act Thursday by Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican. ""I just have two things on the PPE issue which obviously is a huge issue for all of us,"" Baker said on a teleconference the Trump administration held with governors. ""The first is, it's just a little bit about the guidance you're going to offer ... some guidance on how the implementation of the Defense Production Act is going to work with respect to trying to man up and generate initial capacity around this PPE stuff."" Trump turned to Vice President Pence, who is heading up the White House Coronavirus Task Force, to answer Baker's question. He pointed to a desire to let U.S. firms cooperate voluntarily as long as that is possible. MARSHA BLACKBURN: CHINA'S THREAT TO PLUNGE US INTO 'MIGHTY SEA OF CORONAVIRUS' MEANS AMERICA MUST ACT ""I think, Mr. President, you put it well when you talk about the spirit in American business about wanting to ramp up voluntarily to meet the needs that our health care providers have in this country is truly inspiring,"" Pence said. ""And so the president has not yet exercised his authority under the Defense Production Act. He said he will if he needs to. But I think ... the president's perception, the team's perception is now as American industry is stepping forward very aggressively."" Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, the chairman of the National Governors Association and also a Republican, seconds later continued to prod Trump on the production of medical equipment, specifically protective equipment for those treating coronavirus patients. He asked Trump for ""some guidance on implementation of the Defense Production Act so we can kind of help work with [Health and Human Services] Secretary [Alex] Azar and give some thoughts about how the states could be more involved in helping that with some industries in our state."" Democrats, meanwhile, have taken direct swipes at the president for not immediately exercising his powers under the act -- a point of continuing partisan strain even as both parties are working together on legislation to aid Americans affected by the crisis. ""What is going on here, President Trump?"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., tweeted late Thursday night. ""We called on you to invoke the Defense Production Act. But in addition, we expect you to use it immediately. Why aren’t you using this authority now to make testing kits, masks, beds, ventilators?"" MCCONNELL'S CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS PLAN WOULD PROVIDE PAYMENTS OF $1,200 PER PERSON, $2,400 FOR COUPLES Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden also publicly implored Trump to ramp up supply under the Defense Production Act. In a statement Wednesday, Biden said Trump should ""[p]rioritize and immediately increase domestic production of any critical medical equipment required to respond to this crisis"" under the Defense Production Act. The former vice president followed that statement with a tweet Thursday urging Trump to use his Defense Production Act powers. ""Yesterday, President Trump said he was invoking the Defense Production Act, then turned around and said he wasn't planning to use it,"" Biden said. ""The President should exercise these powers now. We need more ventilators, protective equipment, and critical supplies. We need action, not words."" DIANNE FEINSTEIN. 3 SENATE COLLEAGUES SOLD OFF STOCKS BEFORE CORONAVIRUS CRASH: REPORTS ""Lives are at stake. Trump must start taking this national emergency seriously,"" Sanders tweeted Thursday. ""Without delay, we need to use the Defense Production Act to mass produce and distribute urgently needed medical equipment to every state and territory in America."" Others including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., also urged the president to use the Defense Production Act Thursday as medical leaders were sounding the alarm over anticipated shortages caused by the coronavirus pandemic. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""There are dwindling supplies of N95 respirators, isolation gowns, isolation masks, surgical masks, eye protection equipment, intensive care unit (ICU) equipment and diagnostic testing supplies in areas that had the first community outbreaks,"" a Thursday letter from the American Hospital Association, American Medical Association and American Nurses Association to congressional leaders said. The letter, first reported by NBC News, asks for $100 billion in direct funding to hospitals, doctors, nurses and others on the frontline of the coronavirus pandemic. ""It is clear that COVID-19 will test the capacity of America's health care system,"" the letter said.

"                          Mexican president downplaying pandemic concerns; reaction from John Daniel Davidson of The Federalist. As the coronavirus outbreak shutters much of daily life across America, President Trump’s aggressive policies on immigration and border security are not slowing down -- to the contrary, his administration has significantly strengthened restrictions as part of a global effort to stop the spread. Some of the administration’s most significant moves in response to the virus -- which has since escalated into a full-blown pandemic -- were the travel bans on foreign nationals from China, Iran and eventually Europe. Trump initially exempted the U.K. and Ireland when he announced the latter ban last week, but last Saturday added them to that list. CUCCINELLI CLARIFIES ICE NOT SHUTTING DOWN DEPORTATIONS DURING CORONAVIRUS CRISIS Trump caught criticism for the moves, with E.U. leaders expressing their anger in a statement on their ban, claiming the move was “taken unilaterally and without consultation.” But this week, the E.U. itself banned non-essential travel from outside its borders, as have a host of individual countries. It’s something Trump has cited to claim that he was ahead of the curve in combating the crisis. “I was the first one to do the ban,” he told reporters on Thursday. “Now other countries are following what I did.  But the media doesn’t acknowledge that.” Meanwhile, on the southern border, where Trump has spent a significant part of his presidency trying to control illegal immigration, he confirmed Friday that the administration will turn back all asylum seekers and illegal immigrants -- citing the coronavirus outbreak. In a statement, Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf praised the president’s “early, frequent and decisive action” to protect Americans from the coronavirus. He went on to indicate that the administration sees an open border as a risk, and tough restrictions at the border essential to stopping the spread of the virus. “The introduction and spread of coronavirus in our border patrol and detention facilities presents a serious danger to aliens, our frontline agents and officers, and the American people,” he said. “The Department currently apprehends foreign nationals from over 120 different countries, many of whom fail to carry with them any identity, travel or medical documentation.” TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO EXTEND EUROPEAN TRAVEL BAN TO INCLUDE UK AND IRELAND  “DHS will aggressively implement new measures to protect the American people and its workforce as needed,” he said. On Friday, the Trump administration also announced restrictions on non-essential travel between the U.S. and Mexico, following a similar agreement with Canada. Meanwhile, construction of the border wall is going on unabated. A spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) told Fox News on Thursday that the spread of the coronavirus has not affected construction schedules. Workers have built 139 miles of new border wall since Trump took office, with a target of 450 miles by the end of the year. There has been some impact on the legal immigration system, with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announcing this week that it is closing all its offices across the country until at least April in an effort to help stop the spread of the virus. The coronavirus outbreak also has raised the question of whether interior enforcement of immigration laws would be curbed, both to protect illegal immigrants and the officers making the arrests. Immigration activists and civil rights groups urged ICE to suspend deportations so as not to scare illegal immigrants away from receiving health care. “ICE should immediately suspend any enforcement activities that could deter individuals from accessing care,” Andrea Flores, deputy director of policy for American Civil Liberties Union’s Equality Division, said in a statement this week. “People and their families must feel safe to leave their homes and seek medical help or gather the necessary supplies to keep their families safe, regardless of immigration status.” Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) released a statement Wednesday that indicated it was halting most deportations. The agency said that its enforcement and removal operations (ERO) would focus on “public safety risks and individuals subject to mandatory detention based on criminal grounds.” “For those individuals who do not fall into those categories, ERO will exercise discretion to delay enforcement actions until after the crisis or utilize alternatives to detention, as appropriate,” the statement said. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE But that statement from ICE was later clarified by Acting Deputy Homeland Security Secretary Ken Cuccinelli, who promised that ICE will “conduct enforcement operations that protect our communities and uphold our laws.” “This means that ICE will continue to prioritize arresting and removing criminal aliens and other aliens who pose a threat to public safety, just as it always has during President Trump’s administration,” he said. He went on to say that, while those conditions hold, some other removal operations will continue with increased precautions to protect both agents and those being apprehended. “That does not mean that no other removable aliens will in fact be removed, but during the current public health situation, removals will be done in such a way as to minimize the exposure of our agents and of the removable aliens we are encountering,” he clarified. The ACLU called Cuccinelli’s statement “foolish” and accused him of wanting “to sabotage our nation’s response to this pandemic.” But for the administration and its supporters, the border restrictions in the face of a foreign-born virus, as well as other travel bans, are seen as essential for health and national security. Since the U.S. imposed a travel ban for those entering from China, Border Patrol agents have detained hundreds of Chinese nationals attempting to enter the United States illegally, This month the Border Patrol asked the CDC to take over testing of those migrants who show symptoms consistent with COVID-19.

""And if it shifts and we're asked to do more at the SW border, we're ready to operationalize that.” As of Friday afternoon, the U.S. had over 16,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in all 50 states, including Washington, D.C. The U.S., so far, has seen 210 COVID-19-related deaths. Fox News' William La Jeunesse contributed to this report.

"                          Supreme Court postpones March oral arguments over coronavirus concerns. This is the first health crisis-related delay for such proceedings since the Spanish flu a century ago. The Supreme Court reported Friday morning that all nine justices are healthy and participated in their latest regular conference -- though some did so by phone as a precaution against the spread of the novel coronavirus. The coronavirus has been shown to be significantly more dangerous to older people, and six of the nine justices on the court are technically senior citizens. Only Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Elena Kagan are under 65 years old. Even President Obama appointee Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who was born in 1954, is 65 years old. Chief Justice John Roberts is also 65, whereas the oldest justice on the court, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, turned 87 this week. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW The court said the justices are following public health guidelines, including avoiding shaking hands. This is a departure from the justices' longtime tradition of shaking hands with every other justice before beginning a conference in an effort to maintain camaraderie. WHO ARE THE 9 JUSTICES OF THE SUPREME COURT Despite a postponement for oral arguments that were scheduled for late March and early April, the court will continue to release opinions on cases that it has already heard, including on Monday. It will not, however, release hard copies of its opinions at the actual courthouse. The opinions will be released digitally beginning at 10 a.m. The cases affected by the postponement of oral arguments will include three cases involving access to President Trump's financial documents for the House Ways and Means Committee and the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, which were scheduled for argument on March 31. Also on hold are a case regarding military prosecution of rape, a trademark case, a high-profile copyright case between tech giants Google and Oracle, a lawsuit by three Muslims who were put on the ""No Fly List"" after refusing to inform to the FBI, a case on the composition of Delaware's state courts, a case on international funding to fight HIV, a Fourth Amendment case, a deportation case and a case on religiously-based discrimination. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It is unclear whether the Supreme Court will postpone further oral arguments as the coronavirus pandemic continues and also unclear what it will do about the cases it has already postponed. The court is not constitutionally required to hear in-person arguments on its cases, and theoretically could issue decisions based exclusively on written submissions.

"                          Mike Pompeo speaks about the fight against disinformation coming out of places like China, Russia and Iran to disparage American activity Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed China, Russia and Iran for spreading disinformation about the coronavirus in a White House coronavirus task force briefing Friday as he asked Americans to make sure they are getting their information from reputable sources. The comments from Pompeo are a continuation of what has been a tough stance from the secretary of state as the Trump administration has gone back-and-forth with China on who is to blame for the virus' spread. Trump has called the coronavirus the ""Chinese virus"" repeatedly, including Friday, referencing the disease's origins in Wuhan, China. That has drawn objections from both China itself and some left-leaning Americans who claim the terminology is racist. ""It's pretty diffused, unfortunately,"" Pompeo said of where the false information is coming from. ""But we've certainly seen it come from places like China and Russia and Iran, where there are coordinated efforts to disparage what America is doing and our activity to do all the things President Trump has set in motion here."" CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW GOP LAWMAKERS UNVEIL BILL TO CUT AMERICA DEPENDENCE ON CHINESE DRUGS Earlier in the press conference, Pompeo implored Americans to seek information from dependable outlets, citing a falsehood peddled by China that the coronavirus originated with the U.S. military. ""Finally, I want to talk about the disinformation that people are seeing on Twitter, around the world,"" Pompeo said. ""Some of it coming from governments, some of it coming from other individuals. I just urge everyone as they are seeing the information -- information that at one time suggested somehow this virus emanated from the United States Army -- this information about lockdowns that are taking place. Every American, indeed people all around the world, should ensure that where they turn to for information is a reliable source and not a bad actor trying to create a flow of information that they know is wrong."" Later in the briefing, Pompeo continued: ""We've made clear we've spoken to these countries directly that they need to knock it off, that we don't approve of it."" TRUMP UNAPOLOGETICALLY USES PHRASE 'CHINESE VIRUS' A CLASH ESCALATES WITH CHINA OVER ITS ORIGINS President Trump also addressed China's role in the outbreak during the task force briefing: As a reporter began asking Trump about what he has been calling the coronavirus -- the ""Chinese virus"" -- Trump interrupted her and went out of his way to praise Chinese President Xi Jinping. ""It's unfortunate that this got out of control,"" Trump said of the virus. ""It came from China, it got out of control. Some people are upset. I know President Xi. He loves China. He respects the United States and I have to say I respect China greatly and I respect President XI."" Trump has largely refrained from criticizing Xi directly both during the coronavirus pandemic and throughout his presidency, but Trump has gone out of his way to refer to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese Virus"" in recent days as American officials, including members of his administration, have taken a tough stance against China on its apparent propaganda campaign to distract from the fact that its lack of transparency in the early stages of the outbreak significantly contributed to the virus' worldwide spread. China also moved to expel a subset of American journalists from the Washington Post, New York Times and Wall Street Journal earlier this week. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP On Monday, Pompeo called on People’s Republic of China Politburo member Yang Jiechi to push back on a tweet from the deputy director-general for the Chinese Foreign Ministry's Information Department. The deputy director-general, Lijian Zhao, tweeted that the United States military might be responsible for the coronavirus. He provided no evidence to that effect. Additionally, several GOP lawmakers and officials, including Pompeo, have referred to the coronavirus as the ""Wuhan virus"" or the ""Chinese coronavirus."" Meanwhile, multiple members of Congress -- from both parties -- have introduced bills seeking to reduce Ameican dependence on Chinese medical supplies. ""The Chinese Communist Party threatened to cut off America’s access to vital drugs in the midst of a pandemic caused by its own failures,"" Sen.

"                          Will this give Biden the momentum he needs? Fox News contributor Liz Peek weighs in. Mike Bloomberg is transferring an eye-popping $18 million from his now-suspended presidential campaign to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) “to help Democrats win up and down the ballot in November.” Bloomberg officials said on Friday that the transfer by the former New York City mayor to the national party’s coordinated campaign was the largest in recent history.  BLOOMBERG PLEDGES $40 MILLION TO FIGHT CORONAVIRUS AROUND THE WORLD “While our campaign has ended, Mike’s number one objective this year remains defeating Trump and helping Democrats win in November,” Bloomberg advisers said in a letter to DNC Chairman Tom Perez. Bloomberg suspended his campaign on March 4, the day after very disappointing finishes in the 14 states that voted on Super Tuesday. He quickly endorsed front-runner former Vice President Joe Biden – who’s now the party’s likely nominee. Friday’s move by Bloomberg follows through on the pledge he made -- even before he launched his short-lived presidential campaign in late November -- to spend millions of his own money to defeat President Trump and help elect Democratic candidates up and down the ticket regardless of who's the presidential nominee. “The campaign believes this investment will dramatically expand the DNC’s Battleground Build-Up 2020 efforts across battleground states, drawing in part from our own incredibly experienced and talented organizing staff,” the Bloomberg campaign said. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN Perez said in a statement that Bloomberg’s giant contribution “will help us invest in more organizers across the country to elect the next president and help Democrats win up and down the ballot.” Bloomberg's also transferring several of his former campaign field offices to state Democratic parties and helping to speed up the hiring for key organizing and operations positions in key battleground states. These moves should help the Democratic Party and Biden’s campaign as they face off against the massive resources already amassed by the Trump re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee. Biden’s campaign praised Bloomberg’s contribution to the party and called it an “extraordinary investment.” The move also puts to rest a plan by Bloomberg immediately after he ended his White House bid to launch an independent group to assist Democrats. “While we considered creating our own independent entity to support the nominee and hold the President accountable, this race is too important to have many competing groups with good intentions but that are not coordinated and united in strategy and execution,” Bloomberg’s letter to the DNC explained.

"                          President Trump announces he has suspended student loan payments without penalty for at least 60 days, and he's moving tax day to July 15, 2020 President Trump on Friday announced that the administration would allow federal student loan borrowers to suspend their payments without penalty for at least 60 days, and that standardized test requirements would not be enforced for elementary and high school students amid the coronavirus pandemic. The president announced earlier this week that he had waived interest on federal student loans “until further notice,” but took that measure to the next level Friday by suspending payments. SENATE DEMS PROPOSE SUSPENDING STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS AMID CORONAVIRUS “We’ve temporarily waived all interest on federally held student loans,” Trump said during a Coronavirus Task Force press conference Friday at the White House. “They’ll be very happy to hear that and I’ve instructed them to take that action immediately.” “Today, Betsy Devos directed federal lenders to allow borrowers to suspend their student loans and loan payments without penalty for at least the next 60 days, and if we need more we’ll extend that period of time,” Trump said. “Borrowers should contact their lenders, but we’ve given them very strong instructions,” Trump added. “That’s a big thing, that’s going to make a lot of students very happy.” Trump also announced Friday that there will be no enforcement of scheduled standardized testing for high school and elementary school-aged students. “There will be no standardized testing,” Trump said. “A lot of students will be happy. Some, probably not.” The president’s announcement on student loans comes after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and other top Senate Democrats rolled out legislation that would cancel student loan payments for the duration of the coronavirus national emergency. That plan would provide relief to federal student loan borrowers through an “immediate cancellation” of monthly student loan payments during the national emergency, and would “pay down a minimum of $10K for all federal student loan borrowers.” The plan would also require Congress to authorize the Department of Education to make monthly student loan payments on behalf of borrowers, and would “guarantee” the minimum of $10,000 payoff for all borrowers. TRUMP ADMIN, LAWMAKERS HUDDLE TO NEGOTIATE MASSIVE $1T STIMULUS, AMID CORONAVIRUS CRISIS The suspension of payments would be considered a new policy, separate from the deferment and forbearance options that currently exist for borrowers. The plan would also make all payments made by the Department of Education “tax-free” for borrowers. It is unclear, at this point, if Schumer’s legislation will be folded into the massive stimulus plan currently under negotiation on Capitol Hill. Meanwhile, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the president also announced Friday that he had postponed the tax filing day from April 15 to July 15. As of Friday morning, the U.S. had more than 14,250 confirmed cases of coronavirus in all 50 states, including Washington, D.C. The U.S., so far, has seen 205 COVID-19-related deaths.

"                          The Trump Administration's response to coronavirus has been criticized by both Democratic Presidential candidates. Here is how former VP Joe Biden would fight the disease officially known as COVID-19. Former Vice President Joe Biden on Friday slammed President Trump’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak, urging the Republican incumbent to “stop swerving between overpromising, buck-passing, and start delivering protection to our people.” The all-but-certain Democratic presidential nominee – in a conference call with political reporters – also said that as early as Monday he hopes to be holding near-daily briefings regarding the pandemic that’s swept across the nation, which could serve as a political counterbalance to the daily briefings the president and government officials have been giving the past week from the White House. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC “I want to be in daily or least in significant contact with the American people and communicate what I would be doing, what I think we should be doing, and how we should be doing it,” Biden emphasized. “Hopefully by Monday we’re going to be in a very different place in terms of the ability to be in communications with all of you,” Biden explained. The president’s reelection team – responding to Biden – defended the president's actions, with campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh saying that Trump “is leading an unprecedented mobilization of America against the coronavirus and all Joe Biden can offer is ineffective partisan sniping from the sidelines.” The former vice president told reporters that he and his team have “been coordinating with House and Senate leadership in the Democratic Party. We’ve been in contact with the governors.” And he praised New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo -- whose state has been hit hard by the pandemic – for “doing one hell of a job.” Biden spotlighted that he’s been on the phone with officials and aides “probably an average of seven hours a day” and highlighted that “my whole focus is basically been how we deal with this crisis and quite frankly thus far it’s been less about how we campaign or make stark differences between the president and I.” CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW While he didn’t directly contrast himself with the president, Biden did repeatedly blast Trump for what many Democrats have charged was a slow federal response to the crisis and for publicly underplaying the severity of the global outbreak for weeks. Biden stressed, “In times of crisis, the American people deserve a president who tells them the truth and takes responsibility. Unfortunately, President Trump has not been that president.” And he charged that “for the first two months of this crisis, President Trump used his public statements to falsely tell us we had nothing to worry about while praising China’s response for managing the virus at the same time I was urging strongly that he insist that we get more information from the Chinese and we have our experts go to China and see firsthand. To the best of my knowledge, none of that was attempted by the president.” Biden then argued that the president “switched to falsely telling us that he’s taking action he has not taken, promising results he’s not delivered and announcing actions that he not even ordered. And people are scared. They’re worried. They don’t know quite what to do. The president has been behind the curves throughout this whole response.” Speaking directly to Trump, Biden said: “President Trump, stop saying false things, will you? People are worried. They are really frightened. And when these things don’t come true, you just exacerbate their concern. Stop saying false things [you] think make you sound like a hero.” BIDEN AND SANDERS CAMPAIGNS IN REGULAR CONTACT REGARDING CORONAVIRUS Biden specifically criticized the president on numerous fronts including not immediately implementing and using the Defense Production Act – which mobilizes private industry to produce and distribute the necessary medical supplies to fight the crisis – including ventilator and personal protective equipment for medical personnel. The president signed the act on Wednesday but said a day later he hadn’t invoked it yet. On Friday Trump said the act had kicked into “high gear.” Biden charged that Trump “was all over the map.” And the former vice president stressed that “perhaps nothing is more outrageous than the Trump administration’s abject failure on testing -- its refusal to accept responsibility.” “President Trump just claimed this month anybody who wants a test can get it. Let me repeat that. On March 6 he said that anybody who wants a test can get it. I’m sorry to say that was simply a lie and it’s still not true today. The United States has been far behind the rest of the advanced world when it comes to testing,” he added. The Trump reelection campaign fired back – once again criticizing the then vice president’s handling of the swine flu outbreak. “The only thing Joe Biden knows about handling a public health crisis is that the Obama White House had to apologize for his remarks that set off a panic during the swine flu outbreak in 2009,” Murtaugh said in a statement. “When President Trump took the critical step of restricting travel from China in response to the coronavirus, Biden called it ‘xenophobic.’ Most of what Biden says the government should do are things President Trump is already doing,” Murtaugh added. Making elections coronavirus safe  With the coronavirus outbreak forcing states with upcoming presidential primaries to postpone their elections, there’s growing concern that the pandemic that is sweeping the nation and forcing many Americans to hunker down in their homes could severely impact November’s general election. A new study from the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice spotlights sweeping changes to current voting practices across the country – such as universal mail-in voting, ballot drive-by drop off boxes from coast to coast, and easier online voter registration – to make voting in November safe. The authors of the study urge that “implementing that plan must begin now” in order “to ensure that the pandemic does not prevent a free and fair election.” But the plan isn’t cheap – with a price tag at roughly $2 billion.

Bloomberg's massive investment for 2020 Democrats Mike Bloomberg is transferring an eye-popping $18 million from his now-suspended presidential campaign to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) “to help Democrats win up and down the ballot in November.” Bloomberg officials said on Friday that the transfer by the former New York City mayor to the national party’s coordinated campaign was the largest in recent history.

"                          Billionaire candidate ends campaign; reaction from former California Republican Party chairman Tom Del Beccaro. Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg spent nearly $1 billion of his personal fortune on his 2020 presidential campaign, which lasted less than five months and ended without him winning any major primary contests in the Democratic primary season. A Federal Election Commission (FEC) filing revealed on Friday that the billionaire contributed $935,360,675.56 to his campaign during the 2020 election cycle. Before ending his campaign in March, Bloomberg faced a wave of accusations that he was trying to ""buy"" his way to the Democratic nomination. He announced in November 2019, months after the majority of candidates had already started participating in official debates. The former mayor, whose net worth is estimated to exceed $60 billion, flooded the airwaves with $550 million in advertisements. That included $224 million for Super Tuesday states. He first appeared on the ballot then after missing the first four contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. BLOOMBERG GIVING DEMOCRATIC PARTY MASSIVE INVESTMENT FOR 2020 ELECTION Out of the 1,000 delegates up for grabs, Bloomberg only took dozens and failed to pick up wins in any major states. Instead, he only won the American Samoa caucuses. Bloomberg has pledged to donate to assist whoever the Democratic nominee is and recently announced plans to transfer $18 million from his presidential campaign to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in the largest single such transfer ever. Bloomberg’s contribution amounts to more than the national party’s typical cash balance. The transfer will help the DNC make up for some of the steep fundraising disadvantages when compared with its Republican counterpart, which routinely has raised tens of millions more than the Democratic organization throughout election cycles. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Bloomberg campaign, which hired a staff of 2,400 people across 43 states, will also transfer its offices in six pivotal states to the Democratic parties in those states, to help accelerate their hiring and organizing. Those states are Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Former Bloomberg campaign staffers in those offices will continue to be paid by his campaign through the first week in April and have full benefits through the end of April.

"                          Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell introduces latest package addressing coronavirus economic relief. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and members of President Trump’s economic team are huddling with lawmakers on Capitol Hill Friday as he continues negotiations with Senate Republicans and Democrats over the massive, $1 trillion-plus stimulus package amid the coronavirus outbreak. Mnuchin and Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow were meeting with Senate leaders behind closed doors to discuss the latest GOP draft legislation rolled out Thursday by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who hopes to work through the weekend to solidify a plan. MCCONNELL'S CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS PLAN WOULD PROVIDE PAYMENTS OF $1200 PER PERSON McConnell on Friday afternoon put in motion a likely Sunday procedural vote on the bill. Earlier in the day, he explained that the Senate has broken up into four bipartisan groups to work on different aspects of the bill. “I’ve tasked these bipartisan teams to reach an agreement by the end of the day today, midnight,” McConnell said Friday. “We’ll need Saturday to be drafting what we can agree to. And because of the procedural hurdles you have to jump through in the Senate.” McConnell said that he has received direction from Mnuchin and the administration that the measure should be passed by Monday. “That gives you a timeline of what we’re working on through the weekend,” McConnell said. The draft legislation, obtained by Fox News, would provide payments up to $1,200 per person. They would be phased down at adjusted gross income thresholds of $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 per couple. Additionally, there would be $500 payments for each child. The amount, though, is slated to then be reduced by $5 for each $100 a taxpayer’s income exceeds the legislation’s threshold. The amount is reduced to zero for single taxpayers with incomes exceeding $99,000 and $198,000 for joint filers. The legislation also outlined $300 billion for small businesses to keep furloughed and laid-off workers on the payroll and $208 billion in loans to airlines and other industries. READ REPUBLICANS SECTION-BY-SECTION SUMMARY OF THE BILL But McConnell currently may not have enough support to push the legislation through at this point. Some Republicans have objected to certain measures outlined in the bill, and most Democrats say the measure does not go far enough. ""We are beginning to review Senator McConnell's proposal and on first reading, it is not at all pro-worker and instead puts corporations way ahead of workers,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a joint statement. The Democratic leaders said, however, their priority is to ""make sure all workers are protected from the loss of a paycheck or that no family falls into financial ruin because of this pandemic.” Trump, on Wednesday, signed the second coronavirus relief bill into law that provides paid sick leave, unemployment help and free testing to Americans. The legislation provides 14 days of paid sick days to workers affected by the coronavirus, ensures free testing to everyone, including the uninsured, and expands food aid and boosts unemployment dollars to states. The House and Senate already passed a bipartisan $8.3 billion package to prop up the health care system to prepare for the influx of sick Americans. The second response bill that was signed into law Wednesday aims to bring relief to workers who lost their jobs and families at home for illnesses, quarantines or caring for kids whose schools have shuttered. Meanwhile, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Mnuchin announced Friday that, at the direction of the president, he had postponed the tax filing day from April 15 to July 15. As of Friday morning, the U.S. had more than 14,250 confirmed cases of coronavirus in all 50 states, including Washington, D.C. The U.S., so far, has seen 205 COVID-19-related deaths.

"                          Senators selling stocks before the coronavirus pandemic rocked the markets have renewed attention on something called the STOCK Act. Here's what you need to know. The watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) filed a complaint with the Senate Ethics Committee Friday against Sens. Richard Burr, R-N.C., and Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., suggesting they may have engaged in insider trading based on their knowledge about the coronavirus pandemic. News reports surfaced Thursday and Friday about how Burr and Loeffler, along with Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., sold large amounts of stock before the market crashed due to concerns about the coronavirus, igniting accusations from critics of possible insider trading. The complaint says Burr and Loeffler may have violated the 2012 STOCK Act, a law that bans insider trading by members of Congress. The senators have denied wrongdoing, but the watchdog group is calling for a probe. ""If Senator Burr had inside information about how bad the coronavirus outbreak could be and used it to protect his personal fortune, while reassuring the public that the government was prepared for the disease, that would be a shocking violation of the public trust and may have been a violation of the law,” CREW Executive Director Noah Bookbinder said in a statement Friday. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW DIANNE FEINSTEIN, 3 SENATE COLLEAGUES SOLD OFF STOCKS BEFORE CORONAVIRUS CRASH: REPORTS On Loeffler, a release from CREW says that Loeffler ""attended a briefing on the situation as a member of the Senate HELP Committee. That same day, she and her husband made the first of dozens of stock sales executed between then and February 14, worth up to $3.1 million. She also purchased several stocks during this period, including Citrix, which produces teleworking software and could have been impacted by the coronavirus outbreak."" All four senators have defended their actions, with Burr -- who says that he based his decisions on news reports and not information he learned through his job -- taking the most drastic step of calling for a Senate ethics investigation into himself in order to clear the air. He sold between $628,000 and $1.72 million in stocks on Feb. 13, according to ProPublica. According to Roll Call, Burr's net worth was approximately $1.7 million in 2018. WHAT IS THE STOCK ACT? SEN BURR SEEKS ETHICS REVIEW OF HIS STOCK SALES IN RUN-UP TO CORONAVIRUS CRISIS, AFTER SCATHING REPORT ""I relied solely on public news reports to guide my decision regarding the sale of stocks on February 13,” Burr said in a Friday statement defending himself. “Specifically, I closely followed CNBC’s daily health and science reporting out of its Asia bureaus at the time."" A Feinstein spokesman said all of her assets are in a blind trust so she doesn't make those financial decisions. Inhofe also said he does not have anything to do with his financial decisions. Loeffler, who sold millions of dollars worth of stock -- but is so rich that the investment moves add up to a very small percentage of her net worth -- also said that she has no involvement with investment decisions that are made by her financial advisors. ""This is a ridiculous and baseless attack. I do not make investment decisions for my portfolio. Investment decisions are made by multiple third-party advisors without my or my husband's knowledge or involvement,"" she said in a tweet early Friday morning. ""As confirmed in the periodic transaction report to Senate Ethics, I was informed of these purchases and sales on February 16, 2020 — three weeks after they were made."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP While CREW refrains from making outright accusations that the senators made their trades with corrupt intention, it does say the developments are concerning and urgently calls for investigations. ""The job of a U.S. senator is to serve the American people,” Bookbinder said. “It appears that in a time of crisis, these senators chose instead to serve themselves, violating the public trust and abdicating their duty. They must be immediately investigated."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell below 20,000 for the first time since 2017 this week after expectations earlier this year were that it could hit 30,000 any day. Additionally, the New York Stock Exchange has seen four stoppages of trading due to sharp sell-offs in the last two weeks.

Trump said at a White House press briefing Thursday that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will be made available to test whether it helps patients recover from coronavirus. He said it was one of a number of antiviral therapies to limit the symptoms of the virus that the administration is trying to get to Americans as quickly as possible. “I have directed the FDA to eliminate rules and bureaucracy so work can proceed rapidly, quickly and fast,” Trump said.

In order to qualify, under his amendment, an individual must be a U.S. citizen with a Social Security number. Under McConnell's plan, an individual must file taxes and have an income greater than $0 in order to qualify, which Hawley says leaves behind Americans who are disabled, or living in public housing that don't file taxes due to not having any true income of their own. “During this emergency our focus should be on helping every American who needs it, including especially our most vulnerable citizens,"" Hawley said in a statement to Fox News.

And we are all eager to come to a bipartisan agreement as soon as humanly possible."" Schumer said Saturday there are still a number of priorities Democrats have that they are continuing to fight for, including providing ""a massive infusion of resources to our hospitals, our medical facilities, and our other public health infrastructure."" Schumer also said that the package needs to ""put workers first."" ""That means a dramatic expansion and reform of unemployment insurance; we need unemployment insurance on steroids,"" he said. ""Some are calling it 'employment insurance.' It must be easier to access. It must cover many more Americans during this crisis, including Americans who have non-traditional employment. And it must provide more generous benefits. Workers who are laid off should receive a paycheck equal to what they were receiving while employed. Workers must be protected whether they work for businesses small, medium or large."" Trump, on Wednesday, signed the second coronavirus relief bill into law that provides paid sick leave, unemployment help and free testing to Americans. The legislation provides 14 days of paid sick days to workers affected by the coronavirus, ensures free testing to everyone, including the uninsured, and expands food aid and boosts unemployment dollars to states. The House and Senate already passed a bipartisan $8.3 billion package to prop up the health care system to prepare for the influx of sick Americans. The second response bill that was signed into law Wednesday aims to bring relief to workers who lost their jobs and families at home for illnesses, quarantines or caring for kids whose schools have shuttered.

The coronavirus poses an “existential threat” to President Trump’s 2020 reelection, campaign insiders and GOP operatives say. “He’s not running against Joe Biden, he’s running against a virus and the collateral damage from that,” former White House strategist Steve Bannon told The Post, saying the outbreak and its ripple effects were potentially the most complex threat ever faced by the United States. “You could have a financial crash, economic great depression and a war against a bug all simultaneously … Today is November. [Trump] is going to be weighed and measured by the American people by how [he handles] the crisis.” CLICK FOR MORE FROM THE NEW YORK POST One Trump campaign operative was more blunt, saying, “If he f--ks up the economic stimulus around the coronavirus, he loses.” TRUMP SPARS WITH REPORTERS DURING FIERY CORONAVIRUS BRIEFING He continued: “Donald Trump’s biggest hurdle to winning reelection has always been the economy. If the economy is going well and cruising along, he could have sailed to a reelection. If we hit that 20 percent unemployment mark as the Treasury is projecting, it’s going to be hard to say that the economy is doing well.” Polls so far offer a mixed bag.  An ABC/Ipsos survey released Friday found 55 percent of Americans approved of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus, while just 43 percent disapproved — a near-total reversal from what the same poll reported a week earlier. However, the president’s overall approval ratings have slumped from post-impeachment highs of 49 percent to the more typical 44 percent he had before the outbreak, according to Gallup.

"                          Fox News' Chad Pergram says some senators worry about the financial cost of the third phase of the coronavirus relief bill. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, along with several other top Democratic senators, rolled out a plan that would increase Social Security benefits for Americans amid the coronavirus outbreak rocking the nation. Schumer, D-N.Y., Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Ron Wyden, D-Ore., unveiled the plan Saturday, which would increase the monthly amount for those receiving Social Security, Veterans, and Supplemental Security Income benefits by $200 through 2021. The senators said the measure would help to stabilize the economy, and give seniors, veterans and people with disabilities an additional $4,000 over the next two years. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE “Immediately increasing Social Security benefits would put money in the pockets of seniors, veterans, and people with disabilities during these uncertain times,” Schumer said in a statement Saturday. “Senate Democrats are committed to quickly delivering relief to the millions of Americans bearing the weight of this public health crisis.” The measure would also protect Social Security recipients from losing access to other assistance programs, and would be covered by “wealthier Americans” who would “pay back some of the added benefit with their taxes.” “Increasing Social Security benefits would get money directly to millions of people quickly, delivering immediate relief to Americans at heightened risk during this pandemic and boosting our economy,” Warren said. “Social Security was created to respond to the Great Depression, and expanding it now will ensure this critical program helps us meet the challenge of the current crisis.” The plan is included as part of Senate Democrats’ proposal for the third stimulus amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which would be at least $750 billion. WH, LAWMAKERS CONTINUE NEGOTIATIONS ON $1T STIMULUS AMID COVID-19 Schumer, Warren and other Senate Democrats also hoped to include a plan that would cancel student loan payments for the duration fo the coronavirus national emergency, with no penalty and no interest. President Trump, on Friday, said he had directed Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to do just that, and contact federal lenders to give them the OK to allow student borrowers to suspend their payments with no penalty for at least 60 days. The president announced earlier this week that he had waived interest on federal student loans “until further notice,” but took that measure to the next level Friday by suspending payments. Meanwhile, Senate Republicans and Democrats are huddling with members of the White House economic team and the Trump administration Saturday to resume negotiations on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s proposed stimulus package. The draft legislation, obtained by Fox News, would provide payments of up to $1,200 per person. They would be phased down at adjusted gross income thresholds of $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 per couple. Additionally, there would be $500 payments for each child. TRUMP SUSPENDS FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS AMID COVID-19 OUTBREAK The amount, though, is slated to then be reduced by $5 for each $100 a taxpayer’s income exceeds the legislation’s threshold. The amount is reduced to zero for single taxpayers with incomes exceeding $99,000 and $198,000 for joint filers. The legislation also outlined $300 billion for small businesses to keep furloughed and laid-off workers on the payroll and $208 billion in loans to airlines and other industries. Some Republicans have objected to certain measures outlined in the bill, and most Democrats, including Schumer, have sounded the alarm saying the measure does not go far enough in protecting American families, and is too focused on corporations. The Senate is slated to hold a vote on draft legislation on Sunday, after receiving direction from the White House that some sort of measure should be passed early next week.

"                          Vice President Mike Pence provides updates on COVID-19 at the White House coronavirus task force briefing. Vice President Mike Pence on Saturday said he will be tested for the coronavirus, after one of his staffers tested positive for the virus earlier this week. “While the White House doctor has indicated that he has no reason to believe I was exposed and no need to be tested, given the unique position i have as vice president and as leader of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, both I and my wife will be tested for the coronavirus later this afternoon,” he said at a White House press briefing. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Pence’s office said Friday that the unidentified staffer tested positive. Pence said that the staffer is doing well, and had cold-like symptoms for a day and a half and has not been to the White House since Monday. He said that neither he nor President Trump had any contact with the staffer, and that they had worked with the CDC and the White House. Contact tracing had also been done, he said. Pence was appointed by Trump to lead the White House’s coronavirus task force, which has been holding daily press briefings on the virus. PENCE STAFFER TESTS POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS, BECOMING FIRST-KNOWN CASE OF A WHITE HOUSE EMPLOYEE A number of politicians have tested positive for the virus. Rep.

"                          Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell introduces latest package addressing coronavirus economic relief. WASHINGTON — Top-level negotiations between Congress and the White House are pushing toward resolution on a ballooning $1 trillion-plus economic rescue package, as President Donald Trump urged a deal to steady a nation shuttered by the coronavirus pandemic. With a population on edge and financial markets teetering, all sides indicated late Saturday that a deal is within reach. At issue is how best to keep paychecks flowing for millions of workers abruptly sidelined by the crisis. Talks also narrowed on a so-called Marshall Plan for hospitals as well as industry loans to airlines and others all but grounded by the virus outbreak and national shutdown. The post-World War II Marshall Plan helped to rebuild Western Europe. SENATE DEMS PROPOSE ADDITONAL $200 IN MONTHLY SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS, AMID CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced late Saturday all sides were “very close” to a bipartisan resolution. McConnell instructed committee chairmen to assemble draft legislation. Officials put the price tag at nearly $1.4 trillion and said that with other measures from the Federal Reserve it could pump $2 trillion into the U.S. economy. “We are poised to deliver the significant relief that Americans need with the speed that this crisis demands,” McConnell said. “We are poised to deliver the significant relief that Americans need with the speed that this crisis demands.” Talks will resume Sunday morning when the top four congressional leaders of both parties are set to confer privately at the Capitol with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in hopes of striking a final accord. A spokesman for Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said there is “not yet an agreement.” Spokesman Justin Goodman said Democrats look forward to reading the draft and further negotiations. “Everybody's working hard and they want to get to a solution that's the right solution, I think we're very close,"" Trump said at Saturday's briefing, striking a confident tone about the nation's ability to defeat the pandemic soon. “Everybody's working hard and they want to get to a solution that's the right solution, I think we're very close."" On Capitol Hill, the Senate convened the rare weekend session as negotiators raced to complete the package. The Senate's goal is to hold an initial vote Sunday and win Senate passage on Monday. The urgency to act is mounting, as jobless claims skyrocket, businesses shutter and the financial markets are set to re-open Monday eager for signs that Washington can soften the blow of the healthcare crisis and what experts say is a looming recession. Trump has largely stayed out of the details, but said Saturday that he would be lobbying the lead negotiators. On one topic, Trump appears to be agreeing with Democrats as Washington tries to steer clear of the politically toxic bailouts from the last economic crises. Trump expressed a clear distaste for any industry, including the airlines, that would use federal assistance to buy back its own stock in an effort to increase profits. Banning stock buy-backs is one of Democrats’ top business priorities in the emerging package. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and other top White House officials were on Capitol Hill for a second day of nonstop negotiations. But no announcement was expected. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has been in talks with Mnuchin, returned to Washington on Saturday and was scheduled to join Sunday's meeting. Negotiations are focused on providing direct relief to Americans, with one-time checks of $1,200, as well as ongoing payroll support and enhanced unemployment benefits for the newly out of work. Talks are also focused on loans to airlines and other industries blindsided by the crisis, as well as possible aid to the states and billions for hospitals and healthcare providers on the front lines of the outbreak. The emerging package builds on a GOP proposal but Democrats push for add-ons, including food security aid, small business loans and other measures for workers. “We're making very good progress,” Schumer said late Saturday. “We're going to continue working though the night.” On Saturday, Trump opened the daily virus briefing with a roll call of his administration's accomplishments, a week-in-review meant to rebut criticism that the White House was moving too slowly to combat the crisis. The president pushed back against accusations that he was sluggish to act for fear of upsetting China, though he told aides last month that he had not wanted to alienate Beijing by criticizing its secretive handling of the initial outbreak. Trump did not lose his temper, as he did the day before. But mixed, vague messaging still ruled the briefing. For example, as hospitals across the nation report a dire shortage of supplies to care for an expected surge of patients, Vice President Mike Pence said the government was completing a half-billion-dollar order for masks. But none of the government officials at the briefing could suggest when the masks would reach medical facilities, a moment of confusion that caused Trump to grow visibly frustrated. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, tried not to over-promise the effectiveness or speed of medication that could possibly be used to treat the virus. After Trump had exited the briefing room, Fauci answered a question about a Trump tweet about the drugs by saying, “I'm not totally sure what the president was referring to."" Trump also sowed confusion about his use of the Defense Production Act to force American businesses to manufacture needed medical supplies, saying that while he invoked the act this week, he has not yet needed to utilize it to compel businesses to mobilize, despite the pronounced supply shortage. Pence announced that, out of an abundance of caution, he and his wife, Karen, would be tested for the virus after a member of the vice president's staff had tested positive. The result for both was negative, Pence press secretary Katie Miller tweeted Saturday night. Pence had said the staffer, who did not have close contact with either the president or vice president, was doing well. The emerging rescue plan from Congress would be a striking intervention at enormous cost being crafted with a speed unseen since the 2008-09 financial crisis and recession. It builds on Trump's request for Congress to “go big.” A central element is now $350 billion for small businesses to keep making payroll. Companies with 500 or fewer employees could tap up to $10 million in forgivable small business loans to keep paychecks flowing. That's on top of a proposal for one-time checks to all Americans, $1,200 per individual, $2,400 for couples, cut off at higher incomes. Democrats are pushing for increased eligibility for unemployment insurance for those who jobs are simply disappearing. For industry, the initial GOP plan called for $208 billion in loans to airlines and other industries, which would have to be repaid. Negotiators are still hammering out whether there will be money to the states, whose governors have requested billions, as well as how much will be going to hospitals and healthcare providers. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Trump acknowledged the outbreak was hurting his family's business of hotels and country clubs but said he did not know whether his business would be one of the many to seek government assistance. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus.

"                          Governor Andrew Cuomo provides coronavirus projections and how the virus is impacting our health care system Have Democrats found an alternative to Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders for the party’s 2020 presidential nomination? Some seem to think so: The hashtag #PresidentCuomo -- referring to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo -- was trending on social media Saturday as the party’s voters continued to mull who should take on President Trump in November. Just a day earlier, the hashtag #WhereIsJoe was trending as some wondered why Biden's national profile seemed to shrink amid the crisis -- a situation Biden said he planned to address next week. Cuomo has been appearing on television daily since the coronavirus crisis began – largely because his state leads the nation, with more than 12,000 confirmed cases of the virus, also known as COVID-19. GOV. CUOMO WARNS NEW YORK CORONAVIRUS CRISIS COULD LAST MONTHS Many viewers have been responding to Cuomo’s comments about teens and young adults, many of whom Cuomo says have been “unintelligent and reckless” in refusing to heed authorities’ advice about “social distancing” to avoid spreading the virus. ""These pictures of people on beaches, these videos of young people saying, 'This is my spring break, I'm out to party,'"" Cuomo told reporters Thursday at a news briefing in Albany, the state’s capital city. ""This is so unintelligent and reckless. I can't even begin to express it.""       Presidential candidates Joe Biden, left, and Bernie Sanders, right, seemed to be facing new competition for the public's attention in New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo amid the coronavirus outbreak.       Cuomo was back at it Saturday. “There’s a significant amount of non-compliance, especially in New York City, especially in parks,” the governor said, again referring to congregating young people, according to the New York Post. “I’m gonna go down there today, I want to see what the situation is myself.” “President Cuomo is really raising the bar for leadership [right now], and I’m here for it. #PresidentCuomo#CoronavirusPandemic,” one Twitter user wrote. “Proud to have Gov Cuomo not only leading NY but also the country. #PresidentCuomo.” another wrote. “We’re already tested more people than any city . . .” The governor’s frequent appearances on television – national as well as local -- seemed to be overshadowing Biden and Sanders, the two Democrats whose presidential campaigns have largely stalled since the coronavirus crisis began. Cuomo’s sudden emergence in the spotlight may have the two White House hopefuls worried. On Friday, Biden – who had all but clinched the party’s nomination before the crisis began, with an impressive string of primary victories over Sanders -- announced plans to launch daily coronavirus news briefings of his own. The announcement came as the hashtag #WhereIsJoe was trending, Mediaite.com reported. “I want to be in daily or least in significant contact with the American people and communicate what I would be doing, what I think we should be doing, and how we should be doing it,” Biden told reporters. “Hopefully by Monday we’re going to be in a very different place in terms of the ability to be in communications with all of you.” In the same conference call, Biden admitted that Cuomo has been “doing one hell of a job.” Sanders on Saturday suggested sending $2,000 to every American for pandemic relief – a figure that topped the $1,200 that the Senate was debating as it worked on a coronavirus relief bill.  On Friday, Sanders hosted an online roundtable from his home state of Vermont, urging Americans to work together to combat the outbreak, WCAX-TV of Burlington, Vt., reported. The Biden and Sanders camps have also reportedly been in regular contact regarding coronavirus, filling the void as numerous states have postponed presidential primaries. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE But for Sanders, the efforts may already be too little, too late, given the delegate gap between him and Biden following the most recent primaries.

"                          White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow joins Sean Hannity on 'Hannity.' The Senate is expected to vote on the massive, more than $1 trillion coronavirus stimulus package by Monday, but lawmakers on Capitol Hill and Trump administration officials are still negotiating provisions. Fox News has learned that some of the text from phase three of the coronavirus economic relief package could emerge late Saturday, but not the legislation in its entirety. Sources told Fox News that text of the legislation could continue to drift out on Sunday, even beyond the slated afternoon vote. WHITE HOUSE SAYS STIMULUS PACKAGE WILL BE $1.4T  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., adjourned the Senate Saturday afternoon until Sunday, when he plans to hold a cloture vote. McConnell hoped that vote would take place Sunday afternoon around 3:00 p.m. ET. The vote is procedural and would advance the “shell” of the legislation, giving McConnell time to update the bill text until the final vote on the stimulus package, which could take place as early as Monday. White House Economic Adviser Larry Kudlow said that the stimulus package would total between $1.3 and $1.4 trillion before leverage from the Federal Reserve for loan guarantees. “We’re about $1.3 to $1.4 trillion programmatically, not including the leverage from the Fed,” Kudlow said Saturday. “We will generate some loan guarantee facilities from the Fed.” Kudlow explained that those loan guarantees are capitalized in the Exchange Stabilization Fund which is owned and run by the Treasury Department. “We’ll probably seek additional authorization for that,” Kudlow said, without providing a concrete figure. “It’s not a controversial point, but it’s something that both sides agree on because it’s going to help out some distressed areas…airplanes are one of them.” Negotiations between Senate Republicans and Democrats and members of the White House economic team continued through the day Saturday. Senators met in breakout groups in the morning, and held policy lunches throughout the afternoon to meet the new McConnell-imposed 5:00 p.m. ET deadline. Fox News has learned that senators have had trouble reaching a deal--largely due to back-and-forth between Republican and Democrat-proposed provisions. ""Democrats generally have been pushing things,"" Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. ""We've had several sorts of interim recesses here, where they throw something out and we talk about it, or they have to go back and talk to their people."" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Saturday that he had a “very good, very detailed” call with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Saturday morning. “We are making very good progress,” Schumer said Saturday. Schumer said Saturday there are still a number of priorities they have that they are continuing to fight for, including providing ""a massive infusion of resources to our hospitals, our medical facilities, and our other public health infrastructure.” Schumer also said that the package needs to ""put workers first.” ""That means a dramatic expansion and reform of unemployment insurance; we need unemployment insurance on steroids,"" he said. ""Some are calling it 'employment insurance.' It must be easier to access. It must cover many more Americans during this crisis, including Americans who have non-traditional employment. And it must provide more generous benefits. Workers who are laid off should receive a paycheck equal to what they were receiving while employed. Workers must be protected whether they work for businesses small, medium or large.” Schumer and some top Senate Democrats have also proposed including additional $200 per month of Social Security benefits for recipients, as well as to suspend all student loan payments throughout the entirety of the national emergency. President Trump, on Friday, announced that he would suspend all federal student loan payments, penalty and interest free, for “at least the next 60 days.” Despite the disagreements from GOP senators, Schumer said Senate Democrats are ""eager"" to work on a bipartisan basis to pass the stimulus. ""We are all eager to come to a bipartisan agreement as soon as humanly possible,"" Schumer said Saturday. The current draft legislation, rolled out by the Senate GOP and obtained by Fox News on Thursday,  would provide payments of up to $1,200 per person. They would be phased down at adjusted gross income thresholds of $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 per couple. Additionally, there would be $500 payments for each child. The amount, though, is slated to then be reduced by $5 for each $100 a taxpayer’s income exceeds the legislation’s threshold. The amount is reduced to zero for single taxpayers with incomes exceeding $99,000 and $198,000 for joint filers. The legislation also outlined $300 billion for small businesses to keep furloughed and laid-off workers on the payroll and $208 billion in loans to airlines and other industries. Some Republicans have objected to certain measures outlined in the bill, and most Democrats, including Schumer, have sounded the alarm saying the measure does not go far enough in protecting American families, and is too focused on corporations. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., introduced an amendment to McConnell's plan on Saturday, which aimed to expand relief for low-income and middle-income Americans. Hawley's plan lowers the threshold for Americans to qualify for the $1,200 relief. In order to qualify, under his amendment, an individual must be a U.S. citizen with a Social Security number. Under McConnell's plan, an individual must file taxes and have an income greater than $0 in order to qualify, which Hawley says leaves behind Americans who are disabled, or living in public housing that don't file taxes due to not having any true income of their own. “During this emergency our focus should be on helping every American who needs it, including especially our most vulnerable citizens,"" Hawley said in a statement to Fox News. ""Excluding or penalizing families with lower incomes doesn’t make sense. Congress should prioritize lower-income and middle-class families through this crisis.” Meanwhile, White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland declined to share specific details Saturday on whether all GOP senators were on board with the ongoing discussions over the stimulus package. ""I think given the magnitude of the crisis that we face, and the significant need for action, it's pretty obvious to any senator that stepping forward and getting in the way carries with it a significant risk of affecting the market and threatening the ability of the American people to receive the relief that we need,"" Ueland told reporters on Capitol Hill Saturday. Trump, on Wednesday, signed the second coronavirus relief bill into law that provides paid sick leave, unemployment help and free testing to Americans. The legislation provides 14 days of paid sick days to workers affected by the coronavirus, ensures free testing to everyone, including the uninsured, and expands food aid and boosts unemployment dollars to states. The House and Senate already passed a bipartisan $8.3 billion package to prop up the health care system to prepare for the influx of sick Americans. The second response bill that was signed into law Wednesday aims to bring relief to workers who lost their jobs and families at home for illnesses, quarantines or caring for kids whose schools have shuttered. Meanwhile, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Mnuchin announced Friday that, at the direction of the president, he had postponed the tax filing day from April 15 to July 15.

"                          'Fox News @ Night' anchor Shannon Bream delivers a 2020 update in 60 seconds on the biggest political stories. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' plan to help Americans through the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic could cost more than $10 trillion depending on how long the crisis lasts. ""We need to send emergency cash payments of $2,000 to every person in America each month for the duration of this pandemic,"" he tweeted Saturday. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK This is a sizeable outbid of what is currently being considered in the Senate, which is understood to be $1,200 per adult and $500 per child. The money would not be given to those earning more than $100,000 and phased out for incomes below that. Sanders’ plan, however, gives no indication of being any less for children, or any other excluding factor. He has previously tagged the price of his plan overall -- which includes other benefits such as expanded health care access and unemployment assistance -- at being approximately $2 trillion. But, with more than 300 million Americans, that would in theory mean an outlay of $600 billion every month the crisis goes on. While some politicians have said the crisis might last just a few months, others predictions have been more dire. A federal government plan to combat the coronavirus, obtained by The New York Times, warned that a pandemic “will last 18 months or longer.” If that were the case, the costs on just part of the plan would cost more than $10 trillion. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And that is only one aspect of what Sanders wants to do to restart the economy after the crisis. On Friday, he said that Medicare should cover all health care expenses tied to the pandemic. “Right now, 87 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured. Our profit-driven health care system is a danger to our people. During this crisis, Medicare should cover all health care treatment for free, including coronavirus testing, treatment, and the eventual vaccine,” he tweeted.

"                          President Donald Trump provides updates on COVID-19 at the White House coronavirus task force briefing. President Trump on Saturday defended his administration’s actions in the early days of the coronavirus crisis, saying he was ahead of the curve in calling for a travel ban from China -- whom he attacked for their “secretive” approach when the virus emerged. “I get a lot of credit for having closed our country very early to a very heavily infected country, China,” Trump said at a White House press briefing. “Unfortunately, China, I wish China would have told us more about what was going on in China long prior to us reading about it.” CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Trump was asked about a Washington Post report published late Friday which said that Trump downplayed and failed to act on early warnings in classified briefings in January and February about the virus. “Donald Trump may not have been expecting this, but a lot of other people in the government were -- they just couldn’t get him to do anything about it,” one official told The Post. “The system was blinking red.” On Saturday, Trump called the story a “disgrace” and “very inaccurate.” ""It's so insulting when they write phony stories that they know are fake news because they're not insulting me. They're insulting everybody, these incredible people that have worked so hard, so long that are thinking about nothing other than this invisible enemy,” he said. As he has done before, Trump pointed to action he took in the early days of the crisis, namely his decision in early February to slap a travel ban on foreign nationals from China. He later imposed travel restrictions on Iran and Europe. This week, the U.S. agreed with Mexico and Canada to restrict non-essential travel at their borders, too. TRUMP RENEWS CALLS FOR AGENCIES TO 'MOVE FAST' ON POTENTIAL CORONAVIRUS TREATMENTS “And I was pretty much in a very small group of people, I will tell you, it was a tiny little group. Most people even that worked in the White House disagreed with me very strongly,” Trump said. “Saving of those many weeks was a tremendous, tremendous thing. And when they keep talking about acting early, that was the ultimate act.” “And then I also closed Europe early, very early,” he went on to say. “And I took a lot of heat for that, too. But that was a good thing. Now they're doing similar things that way. So I didn't act late. I acted early. I acted far before anybody thought I should be."" The president later focused his attention on China’s secretive approach to the beginnings of the virus after it emerged in Wuhan. Trump has repeatedly referred to the virus as the “Chinese virus” and this week said that “the world is paying a big price for what they [China] did."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP On Saturday he was slightly more conciliatory, emphasizing his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping -- but he still placed the blame on Beijing for their lack of transparency. ""China was very secretive. OK, very, very secretive. And that's unfortunate with that. I have great respect for that country. I have great respect for the leader of that country,"" he said. ""He's a friend of mine. But I wish they were able to.

"                          A new report claims that the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee sold more a million dollars in stocks in mid-February after learning how devastating the coronavirus could be. 'Tucker Carlson Tonight' will have more on the story on Friday. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Saturday that there should be ethics probes into the pre-coronavirus stock sales by Sens. Richard Burr, Dianne Feinstein and others, warning of an “appearance” of a conflict of interest. Schumer, D-N.Y., called for the investigations on MSNBC Saturday after Burr, R-N.C., Feinstein, D-Calif., as well as Sens. James Inhofe, R-Okla., and Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., were hit with allegations of selling large amounts of stocks before the coronavirus crisis rocked Wall Street. BURR SEEKS ETHICS REVIEW OF HIS STOCK SALES IN RUN-UP TO CORONAVIRUS CRISIS “The answer, in one word, is yes. There should be and there will be,” Schumer said on MSNBC. “I don’t own any stocks. I think it’s a very bad idea for senators to own stocks.” He added: “There is either a conflict or an appearance of conflict, and one of the things we need with the public is some degree of trust. It’s pretty low right now.” Schumer said lawmakers who own stocks and “benefit from something that no one else can” diminish public trust in government. “It’s just, the American people have even less faith in government, and, at a time like this, the American people need to have faith,” Schumer said. Schumer’s calls for an ethics probe come after Burr himself requested an ethics review into his own conduct after it emerged that he dumped hundreds of thousands of dollars in stocks in the run-up to the COVID-19 crisis. “I relied solely on public news reports to guide my decision regarding the sale of stocks on February 13,” Burr said in a statement Friday. “Specifically, I closely followed CNBC’s daily health and science reporting out of its Asia bureaus at the time.” He added: “Understanding the assumption many could make in hindsight, however, I spoke this morning with the chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee and asked him to open a complete review of the matter with full transparency.” Burr, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, used more than 30 transactions to dump between $628,000 and $1.72 million on Feb. 13, according to ProPublica. Meanwhile, Feinstein, who is the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and her husband reportedly sold between $1.5 million and $6 million in stock in California biotech company Allogene Therapeutics, between Jan. 31 and Feb. 18, The New York Times reported. A spokesman for Feinstein, Tom Mentzer, denied any wrongdoing, saying that “all of Senator Feinstein’s assets are in a blind trust,” and that “she has no involvement in her husband’s financial decisions.” DOUG COLLINS 'SICKENED' BY LOEFFLER STOCK ALLEGATIONS But Sen. Kelly Loefller, and her husband, Jeffrey Sprecher, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, sold stock on Jan. 24—the same day she sat in on a briefing from two members of President Trump’s Coronavirus Task Force, according to a Daily Beast report. Between that day and Feb. 14, the couple sold stock worth a total between $1.2 million and $3.1 million, the report said. In addition to the sales, they also purchased stock in a maker of software that helps people work at home – just before millions of Americans were forced to leave their offices because of the outbreak, the report said. Loeffler, though, fired back Friday, denying the allegations and saying they are ""absolutely false.” ""If you actually look at the personal transaction reports that were filed, it notices at the bottom that I'm only informed of my transactions after they occur -- several weeks,"" Loeffler explained on Fox News' ""America's Newsroom.” ""So, certainly, those transactions -- at least on my behalf -- were a mix of buys and sells. Very routine for my portfolio,"" she continued. Meanwhile, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., sold as much as $400,000 in stock all on Jan. 27, in companies such as PayPal, Apple and real estate company Brookfield Asset Management, The New York Times reported. But Inhofe pushed back in a statement by saying he was not at a late January briefing and, further, does not have involvement in investment choices. “The New York Times allegations are completely baseless and 100 percent false. I was not at the briefing on January 24. I was meeting with pro-life kids from Oklahoma here for the March for Life and the new nominee to be U.S. Ambassador to Tanzania,” Inhofe said in a statement. “I do not have any involvement in my investment decisions. In December 2018, shortly after becoming chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I instructed my financial advisor to move me out of all stocks and into mutual funds to avoid any appearance of controversy. My advisor has been doing so faithfully since that time and I am not aware of or consulted about any transactions.” If allegations against the senators are true, that they used inside congressional information to benefit their stock portfolios, they could have violated the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, also known as the STOCK Act, passed in 2012, which makes it illegal for members of Congress to engage in insider trading. When asked whether an ethics investigation would take place, a source close to Senate Republican Leadership referred Fox News to the Ethics Committee. The Senate Ethics Committee did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment on whether the panel would initiate an investigation into the senators’ alleged conduct. The Dow Industrial Average plummeted this week amid the COVID-19 pandemic, dropping at one point below 20,000 wiping out all Trump-era gains. By Friday morning, the Dow had reclaimed the 20,000 mark. But by the end of the day Friday, the Dow was back in the 19,000 range.

"                          Governor Andrew Cuomo addresses rumors of quarantining New York City New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced four sites that will serve as temporary hospitals in the state Saturday, amid the coronavirus outbreak rocking the state and the nation. The four initial sites, recommended by the Army Corps of Engineers, are the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City, locations at SUNY Stony Brook in Long Island, SUNY Old Westbury and the Westchester Convention Center. NJ, CT, NY, CA, ILL. ISSUE STAY AT HOME ORDERS AMID CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK New York State, as of Saturday morning, accounts for more than one-third of all confirmed cases in the United States, with more than 8,000 confirmed cases. Fifty-six people in New York have died due to coronavirus. ""Every day we see the number of cases of novel coronavirus continue to rise, and we know that by all projections we're going to have more hospitalizations than we can deal with in our healthcare system,"" Cuomo said in a statement Saturday. ""We have a plan of action to help stop the spread of this virus, including expanding hospital capacity and identifying new hospital beds, and after meeting with the Army Corps of Engineers and hearing their recommendations, we stand ready for the building of temporary hospitals at four facilities in New York State.” He added: “This is a public health crisis, but worse than the virus is the fear, but we have a plan and we are doing everything we can to keep the people informed and save lives."" The sites were identified by an inspection team led by the Army Corps of Engineers and included state officials from New York’s Office of General Services, the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York, the New York Department of Health and the New York State Division of Military and Naval Affairs. The team visited more than a dozen sites to review their capability to serve as temporary hospitals, Cuomo’s office said. “Upon the Governor’s determination, the Army Corps is expected to immediately begin work to construct the temporary hospitals,” Cuomo’s office said in a statement. “The Governor is also requesting FEMA designate four field hospitals with 250 for each state, intended for use in the Javits Center in addition to the temporary hospital to be constructed by the Army Corps.” Cuomo has warned that the virus puts stress on New York state hospitals, and that the state’s hospital system only has 53,000 beds. For days, he has weighed how to create additional space for the expected influx of patients in the coming days and weeks due to the virus.  CUOMO WANRS NEW YORK CORONAVIRUS CRISIS COULD LAST MONTHS Earlier this week, Cuomo and President Trump came to an agreement to ""immediately"" dispatch U.S. Navy hospital, USNS Comfort, to New York City Harbor, which the Pentagon offered as part of the domestic response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The USNS Comfort has 1,000 beds and is run by military personnel, according to the U.S. Naval Institute. The USNS Comfort was in port in Norfolk, Va. undergoing repairs after a six-month tour in South America and would not be ready to arrive in New York until ""mid April"" at the earliest.  At this point, efforts are being made to expedite the timeline. The Pentagon, though, said that the ship's capabilities ""are focused on trauma,"" rather than infectious disease. Meanwhile, on Saturday, Cuomo also announced that the state has identified two million additional N95 masks for purchase, and plans to send one million to New York City and 500,000 to hospitals in Long Island. The governor’s office also said that apparel manufacturers in the state are going to begin to manufacture masks and other medical equipment. New York, according to the governor’s office, is also gathering ventilators form different health facilities across the state to be used in “the most critical areas.” The state has already purchased 6,000 additional ventilators. Additionally, Cuomo announced that State Department of Health Commissioner has recommended trials for new drug therapy to help combat COVID-19. “The FDA is acquiring 10,000 doses of Hydroxychloroquine and Zithromax for New York State to use on a trial basis,” Cuomo’s office said Saturday. Cuomo also warned that the coronavirus outbreak was something the state is likely to grapple with for months. “I don’t believe it’s going to be a matter of weeks, it's going to be a matter of months,” Cuomo said at his daily briefing in Albany, a day after issuing a stay at home order for most New Yorkers. The U.S. has more than 23,400 confirmed cases. 285 people in the U.S. have died.

"                          With growing fears of the coronavirus pandemic, states have begun to respond by postponing their primary elections. Here are the states that have begun to take these initial steps. ATLANTA  — U.S. elections have been upended by the coronavirus pandemic. At least 13 states have postponed voting and more delays are possible as health officials warn that social distancing and other measures to contain the virus might be in place for weeks, if not months. The states that have yet to hold their primaries find themselves in a seemingly impossible situation as they look to balance public health concerns with the need to hold elections. While election officials routinely prepare for natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires, the virus outbreak poses a unique challenge. “Usually when we are dealing with a crisis in elections, it’s something that happens and then it’s done,” said Chris Harvey, Georgia's director of elections. “The difference now is that it’s a spreading threat, a fast-growing threat. We don’t know where, when or how it is going to end.” ""It’s a spreading threat, a fast-growing threat. We don’t know where, when or how it is going to end."" Primaries scheduled for Georgia, Ohio, Maryland, Indiana, Louisiana, Connecticut and Kentucky have all been postponed to May or June. The Rhode Island Board of Elections has recommended the primary be delayed to June, while officials in Wisconsin are debating what to do. $2B PRICE TAG TO MAKE ELECTIONS NATIONWIDE SAFE FROM CORONAVIRUS: STUDY Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers has insisted the April 7 primary be held as scheduled, but a state elections commissioner said this past week that doing so would put people at risk. The state's chief elections official cited a host of problems Wisconsin could face if it moved forward with the election: a poll worker shortage, lack of polling places and potential disruption of absentee voting if mail service in the U.S. were to shut down. All this comes at the worst possible time for election officials, in the middle of a major election year. The virus outbreak erupted halfway through the presidential primary season. Voters in 23 states have yet to cast their ballots. While Arizona, Florida and Illinois held their elections as scheduled last Tuesday, Ohio halted voting over public health concerns after federal officials encouraged people over age 65 to stay home. “We cannot tell people to stay inside, but also tell them to go out and vote,” Gov. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, said on Twitter, in announcing plans to delay. The states that have opted to press ahead have found themselves dealing with what one Chicago elections official called a “tsunami” of cancellations by poll workers, who tend to be older, and a last-minute scramble to relocate polling places away from nursing homes and senior living communities. Severe illness and death associated with coronavirus has been most common in people 65 and older, especially those who have heart disease or other chronic conditions. In addition to the presidential race, dozens of congressional and local primaries are in limbo. Primaries play an important role in deciding which party candidates will appear on the ballot for the November general election. Runoff elections in Alabama, Texas and Mississippi were also delayed, as were local elections in Oklahoma, Missouri and New Jersey. There's no indication May or June will be any better to hold elections, but officials say postponing voting even for a few weeks gives them an opportunity to put in place plans to keep the public safe while voting. This includes moving polling places, recruiting backup poll workers and acquiring enough cleaning supplies for voting sites. “At some point, we have to execute an election,” Harvey said, adding Georgia planned a major push to expand absentee voting for the May primary. There have been calls, including from Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez, for elections to be held mostly by mail. But making this switch will be difficult for some and impossible for others. In several states, it would take legislation or even a constitutional amendment to allow. Even then, election experts say there would be costs and logistical hurdles. For instance, states would have to decide whether taxpayers or individual voters would be responsible for return postage. It would require new machines and software in many places to track ballots in the mail and process and count them when they’re returned. All of that could cost billions of dollars, at a time when state revenues are likely to drop amid increased unemployment and decreased tax collections.       Voters arrive with masks in light of the coronavirus COVID-19 health concern at Warren E. Bow Elementary School in Detroit, Tuesday, March 10, 2020. (Associated Press)       Further, advocates say not all voters can fill out ballots by hand and that sending ballots could miss some voters, such as Native Americans who live on reservations where mail isn’t delivered to every home. Meanwhile, steps taken — or not taken — to change aspects of the voting process are being met with lawsuits from political parties and voting rights advocates. In Ohio, voting rights groups are suing the state for refusing to reopen the voter registration window for the state primary, now scheduled for June 2. Under Ohio law, voters can register up to 30 days before an election. Advocates say the other states with postponed primaries are allowing voter registration ahead of rescheduled elections. In Wisconsin, the Democratic Party has sued to force the state to make it easier to register to vote and request an absentee ballot. They also have asked for mailed ballots to count if they are postmarked by Election Day and received within 10 days after voting. Any increase in absentee voting will surely add to the workload for election offices already stretched thin and navigating recommendations that people work from home. The elections office in Cobb County, Georgia, has sent home most of its temporary and seasonal employees brought on to help prep for elections. That means more work for the full-time employees who remain, as they are already seeing an increase in applications for absentee ballots. “As we prepare for May, there is still so much to do,” said Janine Eveler, elections director for the metro Atlanta county. “Many of us are here when we would like to be home with our families because it’s scary right now.” Looming over the scramble over the primaries are worries about the general election in November, a date that is set by federal law. Federal legislation has been proposed that would have all voters receive a mail-in ballot for the November election and provide federal funds to help states cover the costs. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE The Brennan Center for Justice at NYU's School of Law is calling for task forces in every state to implement plans for executing an election amid a pandemic and urging Congress to provide money to help states. They estimate their proposals, including universal mail-in voting, could cost up to $2 billion. “Things will need to change,” said Wendy Weiser, head of the center's democracy program. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three weeks to six weeks to recover.

"                          Tens of millions of Americans directed to stay home as coronavirus crisis escalates; Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin joins John Roberts on 'Fox News Sunday.' Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin expressed confidence in the future of the U.S. economy Sunday, and was optimistic about lawmakers’ ability to move forward with a stimulus plan to help Americans deal with the coronavirus outbreak. Mnuchin is set to meet Sunday with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy, D-Calif., Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to discuss a relief package expected to top $1 trillion. CORONAVIRUS RESCUE DEAL TOPPING $1T ‘VERY CLOSE,’ MCCONNELL SAYS “I think we have a fundamental understanding and we look forward to wrapping it up today,” Mnuchin told “Fox News Sunday.” Mnuchin explained various aspects of the legislation that lawmakers are currently working on. The first is what he called “small business retention loans,” which he said would give small businesses two weeks of cash flow to pay employees. “You need to retain them. You’ll also get some overhead. And if you do that, those loans will be forgiven,” Mnuchin said. “That will allow small businesses to keep people, and make sure when we open up the economy, they’re up and running.” He also said that the government will provide direct deposits, with an average family of four receiving approximately $3,000, as well as “enhanced unemployment insurance” for those laid off due to the outbreak. The fourth part, Mnuchin said, is “a significant package working with the federal reserve, which will provide “up to $4 trillion of liquidity that we can use to support the economy.” RECOVERED FLORIDA CORONAVIRUS PATIENT URGES YOUNG PEOPLE TO FOLLOW ‘ISOLATION PROTOCOLS’ Mnuchin said the plan is meant to deal with “a 10-to-12-week scenario,” but that they are prepared to do more if it lasts longer. For the long term, Mnuchin maintained confidence, saying he expects a full economic recovery from the outbreak once it has passed. “The U.S. economy is strong. We’ve stopped major parts of it, but when we get through this virus, as I’ve said, I think you’re gonna see the U.S. economy come back to the strength, we have great companies, we have great workers,"" he said. ""What we need to do is have a bridge to get through this. And this isn’t the financial crisis that’s gonna go on for years.” McConnell announced late Saturday all sides were “very close” to a bipartisan resolution, and the Senate is expected to hold a procedural vote on a bill Sunday afternoon.

"                          Coronavirus task force member Dr. Anthony Fauci joins Laura Ingraham to update the Trump administration's efforts to disrupt the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Sunday that while the U.S. will definitely “get hit” by coronavirus, he has reasons to believe that the country may fare better than other parts of the world, at least in part due to early action by the Trump administration. When asked on CBS’ “Face the Nation” if the situation in the U.S. will eventually decline to the extent it has in Italy, Fauci said “not necessarily at all,” noting that while it is unclear exactly why the situation in Italy has remained so dire, it is possible that by blocking travel from China earlier this year, President Trump may have prevented a larger spread of the virus. CORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN “Early on they did not shut out as well the input of infections that originated in China and came to different parts of the world. One of the things that we did very early and very aggressively, the president put the travel restriction coming from China to the United States and most recently from Europe to the United States because Europe is really the new China. Again I don’t know why this is happening there to such an extent, but it is conceivable that once you get so many of these spreads out they spread exponentially and you can never keep up with the tsunami.” Fauci also pointed to Americans’ social distancing efforts as key to preventing the U.S. from suffering as much as Italy has been. ITALY CORONAVIRUS DEATH TOLL SPIKES YET AGAIN, UP 793 IN 24 HOURS “The kinds of mitigation issues that are going on right now, the things that we’re seeing in this country, this physical separation at the same time as we’re preventing an influx of cases coming in, I think that’s going to go a long way to preventing us from becoming another Italy.” CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP On Saturday, Italy saw its number of cases and deaths due to coronavirus astronomically leap once again, up 793 deaths with 6,557 newly confirmed cases recorded in just 24 hours. Saturday's jump marks the worst day for fatalities since the crisis began just four months ago. The country now counts 53,578 diagnosed infections, up 13.9 percent, with 4,825 deaths -- the highest in the world. Fox News' Julia Musto and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Peter Gaynor promised on Sunday that more masks and health care supplies were being shipped out to combat the coronavirus pandemic, but would not go into details about when the masks would arrive or provide any specific numbers.  Speaking during an interview on ABC’s “This Week,” Gaynor attempted to assuage the growing concerns across the country that health care workers – especially in virus hotspots like New York and California – could soon run out of supplies as the crisis worsens. “They have been distributed. They've been distributed over the past couple of weeks. They're shipping today. They'll ship tomorrow,” Gaynor said.  HOW TO PREVENT THE SPREAD When pressed by ABC’s Martha Raddatz about whether the masks would arrive at facilities before the health systems in hard-hit areas run out, Gaynor deferred the question. ""I mean, it is hundreds of thousands of millions of things that we're shipping from the stockpile. I can't give you the details about what every single state or what every single city is doing,"" he responded. “But I'm telling you that we are shipping from our national stockpile, we're shipping from vendors, we're shipping from donations. It is happening. The demand is great."" The White House coronavirus task force announced on Saturday that 600 million N95 respirator masks had been ordered, but could not give an exact date of when they will reach health care workers. Gaynor called the shortage of medical supplies “a global problem” and said that every country around the world is trying to deal with the pandemic.  “We’re going to try to meet every need in the nation,” he said. “But a word of caution: the supplies that governors are looking for are the same supplies that every other country in the world is looking for, so this is a global problem,” he said.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., called on President Trump on Sunday to put the Defense Production Act into play and order the emergency production of medical supplies, arguing that the president’s reluctance to do so will “cost lives” as New York quickly becomes the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States.  “There are not enough face masks, gloves, ventilators, hospital beds to get us through this,” Ocasio-Cortez said during an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “Many hospitals are already at capacity or approaching capacity. And there is kind of no real stream in sight from the federal government on where these materials are coming from She added: “The fact that the president has not really invoked the Defense Production Act for the purpose of manufacture of emergency manufacture is going to cost lives.” TRUMP ANNOUNCES HE IS INVOKING DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT TO FIGHT CORONAVIRUS Trump announced last Wednesday that he would tap the Defense Production Act if needed in an effort to help the private sector ramp-up manufacturing and distribution of emergency medical supplies and equipment, and on Friday said that he has that “in gear.” So far, however, there has been no official announcement that the act has been invoked.  The act, which was first enacted in 1950 as a response to the Korean War and has since been re-invoked more than 50 times since, will streamline production of medical supplies to help the country battle the coronavirus pandemic and require businesses to sign contracts or fulfill orders deemed necessary for national defense. “It is absolutely needed,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “We are thankful to anyone who's pitching in on this effort, but we are nowhere near the beds, the capacity and the capacity that we need in this country.” CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said he implored Trump during a phone call Friday to invoke the act immediately to order the manufacture of ventilators and other critically needed medical gear.

"                          White House trade adviser Peter Navarro weighs in on the federal government’s response to COVID-19 on ‘Sunday Morning Futures.’ White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that President Trump is ""now a wartime president"" -- and that the country now has a ""clear battle plan"" reminiscent of its mobilization during World War II. Navarro made the remarks when asked by Maria Bartiromo about a Bank of America assessment that jobless claims could spike to 3 million next week. ""We've got planes in the air. We got FEMA planes, FedEx planes, we got Pentagon planes -- and that's what I'm focused on,"" Navarro said. ""The American people should be comforted because the full power of American production is coming to bear on this, just like in World War II."" Navarro emphasized that his primary role in White House operations now was ""tactical,"" including work on ""getting the supply chain to deliver what we need to the places where we need it,"" including gowns, face masks and ventilators. ""We're gonna suffer some economic impacts in the short run."" ILHAN OMAR PRAISES TRUMP CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE, USE OF DEFENSE MOBILIZATION ACT ""Let me give you some examples that may provide a little comfort to the American people on-air; literally across the street, in my office, every day, we're working to deliver products,"" Navarro said. ""Just in the space of a week, we've had close to a million swabs delivered with the help of the Pentagon and FedEx spread across the country. Pernod, which is a liquor company, has donated hand sanitizer with their production lines. We're gonna get a truck coming right into New York City on Tuesday with that."" He added: ""Honeywell -- we've got a factory springing sprouting up in Smithfield, Rhode Island, to give us millions of masks. We have the National Council of Textile Organizations. It's the Fruit of the Loom, Hanes, Parkdale Mills. They're gonna give us millions of masks. They're very immediately hitting the ground running on that, and our job here is to not only get the production done, but to get it to the people in need."" Some of the production began after Trump tapped his authority under the 70-year-old Defense Production Act to give the government more power to steer production by private companies and try to overcome shortages in masks, ventilators and other supplies. Even Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., unexpectedly praised Trump's invocation of the law and other measures, saying it was ""incredible and the right response in this critical time."" Relief assistance, fiscal stimulus, affected industries and liquidity needs comprised the four points of the ""compass"" that Republicans wanted to hit with upcoming legislation, Navarro said. He added that those goals will be achieved, respectively, with paid family and sick leave, a cash cushion to workers with payroll tax holiday deferrals for small businesses, a $200 billion collateralized loan program with about 25 percent to airlines and the Federal Reserve using the exchange stabilization fund. TWO CONGRESSMEN TEST POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS ""That's a sound strategy,"" Navarro told Bartiromo. ""We're gonna hit all four points of that compass. We're gonna see that bill soon, and hopefully the Democrats and Republicans all join hands on that.""

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin indicated a deal was within reach, but top congressional Democrats raised concerns ahead of a meeting at the Capitol. In the hours before the closed-door talks were to convene in an otherwise empty Capitol, Trump's lead negotiator said the plan was meant to prop up the nation's weakened economy for the next 10 to 12 weeks. “I think we have a fundamental understanding and we look forward to wrapping it up today. It will get done,"" Mnuchin said on “Fox News Sunday."" Meanwhile, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Sunday the stringent measures being put in place in the U.S. including travel restrictions, the closing of schools and many businesses and other social distancing will go “a long way” to prevent the U.S. from becoming like Italy. Italy has seen over 50,000 coronavirus cases and nearly 5,000 deaths.

"                          The National Rifle Association cancelled its annual meeting amid fears of the coronavirus. The National Rifle Association (NRA) published a video this weekend showing Carletta Whiting, a breast-cancer survivor said to have a fibromyalgia-related disability, outlining her reasons for possessing firearms during the coronavirus pandemic -- and it didn't take long for a top Senate Democrat to call the message ""sickening."" The flare-up highlighted the ongoing disputes between some municipalities seeking to restrict Second Amendment rights, and others arguing that times of crisis were precisely the moments when gun rights needed to be protected. Police departments in major cities, including Philadelphia, already have abandoned making arrests for various offenses. New Orleans and other jurisdictions have assumed the power to ban gun transfers. ""What's in my control is how I defend myself if things go from bad to worse,"" Whiting said, before firing a 9MM round from her AR-9 rifle. ""I know from history how quickly society breaks down during a crisis, and we've never faced anything like this before, and never is the Second Amendment more important than during public unrest."" Whiting noted that ""even liberals in California"" were ""lining up because they know the government will not be able to protect them."" In mid-March, the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check (NICS) experienced a threefold jump in background-application processing compared to the same time period last year. MASSIVE SPIKE IN FIREARMS SALES AMID CORNAVIRUS PANDEMIC Several states, meanwhile, also have reported dramatic upticks in gun purchases. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation announced last week it had received over 14,000 background checks for firearm purchases in the preceding week, and only 7,000 in the same period in 2019. And, Virginia State Police saw 64,000 background check requests in February, compared to 39,300 last February. Nevertheless, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., slammed the video, and suggested that the NRA was urging gun-owners to avoid stockpiling food and other resources. In the video, Whiting argued that stockpiling only food alone was not sufficient. ""Mainstream gun owners have left the NRA, so now they’re reduced to telling people to stockpile assault weapons, instead of food, to get ready for the coming Coronavirus civil war,"" Murphy tweeted. ""So sickening."" In response, the NRA called Murphy's attack disingenuous, and part of a larger effort by Democrats to undermine gun rights. ""Sen. Murphy is either being intentionally disingenuous or is obtuse,"" the NRA's director of media relations, Amy Hunter, told Fox News. ""Carletta Whiting is one of millions of Americans who feel vulnerable and who know that when crime happens, the police are minutes away — despite their best intentions. ""Right now, anti-gun politicians are using the pandemic to try and strip Americans of their Second Amendment rights,"" Hunter continued. ""Meanwhile, gun sales are increasing because good people are worried their government won't be able to protect them. This is when Americans rely on their Second Amendment rights the most."" Meanwhile, there has been some concern that the national supply may not be able to meet the growing appeal. ""That percentage is expected to increase before the end of March dramatically.

"                          The ‘Fox News Sunday’ panel weighs in. Former Vice President Joe Biden issued on Sunday a harsh criticism of the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic – saying Trump “neglected, minimized and lied about this virus” while ignoring warnings from the country’s top public health and intelligence officials on the threat it posed to the United States.  Biden – the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination – also hit Trump for claiming that he had set in motion the Defense Production Act to quickly ramp up the fabrication of medical masks and other supplies that are in short supply to battle the contagion’s outbreak, despite the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency Sunday saying otherwise. “[D]espite telling the American people that he was using the Defense Production Act to bring the full force of our government to protect our doctors, nurses and other medical professionals and get them the devices that they need to save Americans in hospitals who are literally struggling to breathe, his lead emergency management official says it is not true,” Biden said in a statement. He added: “Mr. President, stop lying and start acting. Use the full extent of your authorities, now, to ensure that we are producing all essential goods and delivering them where they need to go.” HOW TO PREVENT THE SPREAD The Defense Production Act, which was first enacted in 1950 as a response to the Korean War and has since been re-invoked more than 50 times, is meant streamline production of medical supplies to help the country battle the coronavirus pandemic and require businesses to sign contracts or fulfill orders deemed necessary for national defense. Under the act, companies are required to accept and prioritize contracts from the government and to prioritize “materials, services and facilities to promote the national defense or to maximize domestic energy supplies.” While this provision has historically been used to ramp up military production, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic the act will be used for medical supplies. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he implored Trump during a phone call Friday to invoke the Korean War-era act immediately to order the manufacture of ventilators and other critically needed medical gear. The president told Schumer he would, then could be heard on the telephone making the order. He yelled to someone in his office to do it now, said Schumer’s spokesman, Justin Goodman. FEMA Administrator Peter Gaynor, however, said during an appearance Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” that the administration had not yet ordered any companies to ramp up production of any critical supplies. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE “We haven't yet,” Gaynor said. “It really is leverage, I think that to demonstrate that we can use it, the president can use it any time.” Gaynor added: “If it comes to a point we have to pull the level, we will. But, right now, it is really – it's really a great sign about the greatness of this country.” Gaynor attempts to assuage the growing concerns across the country that healthcare workers – especially in virus hotspots like New York and California – could soon run out of supplies as the crisis worsens appeared to do little to help as Biden’s criticism was echoed by a number of governors across the country. Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York – the hardest hit so far by the coronavirus with more than 15,000 reported cases – urged the federal government to take over the distribution of medical supplies for the crisis as state’s are currently competing with one another to obtain masks and other materials. “Sometimes the federal government is better equipped when it comes to buying the supplies and the volume,” Cuomo said on CNN. “Let the federal government take the responsibility. And number two, let them use the federal Defense Production Act, where the president can say to the manufacturers, ‘I want you to make these products, stop making what you're making, make these because it's a matter of public health.’” The Associated Press contributed to this report.

"                          Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blasts Democrats over failing to move forward with coronavirus relief package. President Trump tweeted Sunday that his administration will reassess its response to the coronavirus outbreak at the end of the 15-day period that calls on Americans to limit their normal behaviors in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. Businesses across the U.S. have been turned on their heads as federal, state and local governments called for drastic measures to block more infections. Stocks on Wall Street plunged to their worst losses in more than three decades. ""We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself,"" the president tweeted in caps lock, before announcing the reassessment. Trump last week moved to blunt the impact of the pandemic on a U.S. economy fundamentally altered by a push for the nation to stay home. Hotels, restaurants, airlines, and retailers have suffered major losses. The emergency stimulus bill also hit a snag in the Senate hours before Trump's tweet. The GOP-controlled Senate failed to move forward with the $1.4 trillion ""Phase Three"" stimulus package intended to help businesses and families devastated by the downturn over the coronavirus outbreak. Many Democrats had complained that the draft aid package did not go far enough to provide health care and unemployment aid for Americans, and failed to put restraints on a proposed $500 billion ""slush fund"" for corporations, saying the ban on corporate stock buy-backs are weak and the limits on executive pay would last only two years. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, exiting the Capitol just before midnight, struck an optimistic note: ""We're very close,"" he said, adding negotiators would work through the night. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., after meeting multiple times with Mnuchin, said progress was being made. ""There's a good chance we'll have an agreement,"" Schumer said as the Senate gaveled close, shortly before midnight. ""We are fighting for a better bill.""

"                          Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blasts Democrats over failing to move forward with coronavirus relief package. “We need Congressional action by Monday,” warned one Republican administration source late last week to Fox. “Monday” was supposed to be the deadline for the Senate to act on the third legislative phase of the coronavirus response. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) set up a process late last week where the Senate would take a procedural vote Sunday to begin debate on a “shell” of a bill. Once there was a deal, McConnell would insert the coronavirus package into the parliamentary empty box. The hope was that the Senate could get 60 yeas to open debate on the coronavirus measure Sunday – then speed up the process and pass the bill Monday. Then the House would have to move to align with the Senate sometime in the near future. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE That all melted down Sunday night.  Republicans were always going to need buy-in by Senate Democrats to start debate on the legislation. As we always say on Capitol Hill, it’s about the math, it’s about the math, it’s about the math.  The current Senate breakdown is 53 Republicans and 47 senators who caucus with the Democrats. The procedural vote required 60 yeas to overcome a filibuster.  But lacking sign-off by Senate Democrats - to say nothing of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) - the procedural vote garnered only 47 yeas. McConnell was for advancing the plan. But the Kentucky Republican changed his vote at the end. Senate rules allow a senator to call for a re-vote if they cast their ballot on the prevailing side of the issue – in this instance, the nays. So even though McConnell was for it, he strategically switched his vote so he could ask for another vote. Late Sunday night, there was no vote scheduled. It’s unclear how fast the sides can forge an agreement – if at all. But it didn’t take an exercise in Euclidian Geometry to see that the procedural vote was going to fail on Sunday afternoon. Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) announced he tested positive for coronavirus before the vote. Two other GOPers were already self-quarantining. Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Mitt Romney (R-UT) announced they would quarantine since they had exposure to Paul.  That means Senate Republicans barely have a majority right now: 48-47. McConnell excoriated Senate Democrats and Pelosi for blocking the shell bill Sunday. “We’re fiddling here. Fiddling with the emotions of the American people. Fiddling with the markets. Fiddling with our health care,” thundered a visibly angry McConnell. The Majority Leader then publicly lambasted Pelosi.  GET THE FOX NEWS APP “She’s the Speaker of the House. Not the Speaker of the Senate. We don’t have one. We were doing just fine until that intervention,” bellowed McConnell.  But Senate Democrats weren’t going to budge unless there was sign-off from Pelosi. After all, Pelosi must figure out a way to shepherd a Senate-GOP produced product through her body. And, if time is of the essence, there are questions as to why McConnell forged ahead without the votes lined up.  And so, we’ll see if things move on Monday.  As the Senate voted, the Dow futures plummeted five percent within minutes of opening Sunday night. That’s the maximum decline allowed before circuit breakers kick in, suspending trading. That’s an ominous warning, portending a rocky trading session on Monday. So what about all of that talk about Congress moving “by Monday?” Fox was told last week that “by Monday” was a dire warning to lawmakers to wrap this up. It was reminiscent of the nighttime meeting on September 18, 2008 in the Speaker’s Office amid the financial crisis. Pelosi phoned then Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson for a status report. Paulson told Pelosi that they urgently needed to talk in person at the Capitol that night as the country teetered on the edge of an economic collapse.  Pelosi later said that Paulson told her if they didn’t negotiate later that evening “we wouldn’t have an economy by Monday.” Now, back to 2020. “The markets are not going to tolerate inaction,” said one Republican source. “They need to move by Monday.” So, we’ll see what they can resolve to avoid a bloodbath on Wall Street Monday morning.  And then there is the war of attrition: actual concern about the health of senators.  As I reported on the air last Wednesday night, Fox was told then that finishing the coronavirus bill was a race against time. Lawmakers needed to wrap this up before everyone on Capitol Hill got sick. Now “coronavirus is in the Senate,” as McConnell declared Sunday night. Some senators from both parties are livid at Paul, an ophthalmologist by training, for showing up on Capitol Hill as he awaited results of a coronavirus test. Paul’s positive test sent shockwaves through the Senate. Some questioned the wisdom of why, day after day after day, GOP senators have repeatedly huddled for lunch meetings on Capitol Hill. At first, it was the standard location, the Mike Mansfield Room near the Senate chamber. Then, the Kennedy Caucus Room in the Russell Senate Office Building. There were also conclaves in the Central Hearing Facility in the Hart Senate Office Building. Notably, no Democratic senator has yet tested positive. Democrats have held all of their meetings via conference call.  “Personally, I would just stay a lot further away if I had a test pending,” said Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) of Paul. “Might not have gone to the gym. Might not have sat at a meal. Maybe I would make arrangements to vote all by myself without somebody else in the chamber. There’s lots of room here. He is a physician himself. So one would think his ability to assess the risk is pretty good. And maybe in that education and ability, he calculated wrong.” Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) scorched Paul on Twitter, though she didn’t mention her colleague by name. “I’ve never commented about a fellow Senator’s choices/actions. Never once,” tweeted Sinema. “This, America, is absolutely irresponsible. You cannot be near other people while waiting for coronavirus test results.” Most lawmakers think they are ten feet tall and bulletproof anyway. Lawmakers keep saying they are doing everything in compliance with CDC guidelines and in consultation with U.S. Capitol Attending Physician Dr. Brian Monahan.  But patience is running thin.  “We need to walk with the Attending Physician,” said one senior GOP source, referring to Monahan. “And Paul.” This is why no one is quite sure how they bring the House back to vote on the phase three coronavirus bill. They’ve floated everything from approving the package via unanimous consent – where no one in the chamber objects – to stretching out the vote over a day or two. To be frank, House members are completely flipped out about having to come back to align with the Senate. But that presumes the Senate can get an agreement and send it to the House. Let alone, “by Monday.”    ",         ‘By Monday’ never seemed so far away after Senate fails to advance coronavirus stimulus package,         2020-03-22T230029-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/by-monday-never-seemed-so-far-away-after-senate-fails-to-advance-coronavirus-stimulus-package,Fox

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. The Senate vote was to consider a $1.4 trillion “Phase Three” stimulus package meant to help businesses devastated by the downturn over the coronavirus outbreak. During his livestream, Sanders blasted the package proposed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE “It is hard for me to believe that in the midst of this terrible crisis that we have a Senate Republican bill that would give the Trump administration a blank check to hand out corporate welfare to virtually any corporation in America, without conditions as to how they can protect workers in this country,” Sanders said. The Senate failed to move forward with the package amid strong opposition from Democrats. Meanwhile, many Democrats complained the draft aid package did not go far enough to provide health care and unemployment aid for Americans, and failed to put a restraint on a proposed $500 billion “slush fund” for corporations. The Democrats said the ban on corporate buybacks was weak and limits on executive pay would last only two years. “What we’re seeing today with the Senate GOP bill is just a complete mockery of public service,” Ocasio-Cortez said in the livestream. “We’re supposed to be here to help people. What Mitch McConnell and the Republicans in the Senate just presented was just a package of corporate sweeteners to hand a blank check to Trump and [Treasury Secretary Steven] Mnuchin.” For his part, McConnell said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., “poured cold water on the whole process” by leading the House Democrats’ opposition to the bill. Sanders decried bailouts for the airline industry, the hotel industry and even the candy industry, saying those industries “are not talking about how they’re going to protect the workers.” BERNIE SANDERS' CORONAVIRUS AID PLAN COULD COST OVER $10 TRILLION Sanders again reiterated that the federal government must act “no matter what the cost” to stem the economic damage from the pandemic. “I know some of my Republican colleagues are talking about, gee, a one time, $1,000 payment, really, really gonna last for two or three weeks, and what happens after that?” Sanders said. “We must act in an unprecedented way, don't matter what it costs,” the senator added. “That means the guarantee [to] every man, woman and child in this country that we will make them hope and we're not going to leave them out.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sanders repeatedly has called for “emergency cash payments” to be sent to every American each month for the duration of the pandemic.

"                          Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blasts Democrats over failing to move forward with coronavirus relief package. The GOP-controlled Senate on Sunday failed to move forward with considering the $1.4 trillion ""Phase Three"" stimulus package intended to help businesses and families devastated by the downturn over the coronavirus outbreak, as Senate Majority Leader McConnell, R-Ky., blasted Democrats opposed to the plan.  The vote came while at least five GOP senators were in self-quarantine, including Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who became the first U.S. senator to announce he tested positive for the virus. Senators were asked to practice social distancing and were given a list of health guidelines to follow while entering the chamber.

Democrats also pushed for add-ons including food security aid, small business loans and other measures for workers — saying the three months of unemployment insurance offered under the draft plan was insufficient. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the draft package ""significantly cut back our hospitals, our cities, our states, our medical workers and so many others needed in this crisis."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., urged colleagues to ""take responsibility"" as Democrats prepared their own draft. The House had just returned from a weeklong recess. After the bill failed to move forward, McConnell tore into Democrats, accusing them of backing out of a bipartisan agreement once Pelosi and Schumer intervened. He claimed Pelosi took ""a week off"" and ""poured cold water on the whole process."" He also said the Senate would re-vote on the motion to proceed with consideration of the bill Monday morning, ""15 minutes after the markets open to see if there's a change of heart."" ""The build-up to this is that we had a high level of bipartisanship over the last 48 hours... And then, all of a sudden, the Democratic leader and the speaker of the House shows up...and we're back to square one,"" he said, referring to Schumer and Pelosi. ""I want everybody to understand that if we aren't able to act tomorrow, it's because of our colleagues on the other side, continue to dicker."" He then accused Pelosi of overstepping boundaries, saying: ""She's the speaker of the House, not the speaker of the Senate."" McConnell said the Senate will hold a cloture vote again at a time of his choosing, adding, ""hopefully some adults will show up on the other side of the room and understand the gravity of the situation before the markets go down further...we've never been confronted by anything like this before."" After Democrats blocked the vote, the National Republican Senatorial Committee [NRSC] released a statement accusing Pelosi, Schumer and Senate Democrats of ""partisan fervor to thwart a critical coronavirus relief package while our country faces a crippling pandemic."" ""DSCC-backed candidates last weekend had no problem throwing partisan barbs at the same Republican senators working day and night to find solutions to the complex problems facing their constituents at home,"" NRSC Communications Director Jesse Hunt said. ""Those same candidates should prove they aren’t beholden to their chief benefactor Schumer and disavow Senate Democrats’ unthinkable decision to filibuster."" Schumer later reiterated Democrats' initial concerns over not wanting to move the bill forward. ""We voted no on the McConnell-GOP bill because among other problems it includes huge bailouts without protections for people and workers and without accountability, and because it shortchanges our hospitals and healthcare workers who need our help,"" Schumer tweeted. ""These changes need to be made."" Schumer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were ""working late into the night, and they just had another productive meeting,"" a Schumer spokesman said late Sunday. Schumer and Mnuchin met at least four separate times during the day. ""We're not here to create a slush fund for Donald Trump and his family, or a slush fund for the Treasury Department to be able to hand out to their friends,"" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said earlier. ""We're here to help workers, we're here to help hospitals."" The urgency to act has been mounting, as jobless claims have risen, many businesses shuttered and the financial markets are set to re-open Monday eager for signs that Washington could soften the blow of the health-care crisis and what experts have warned could be a looming recession. At issue: how best to keep paychecks flowing for millions of workers abruptly sidelined by the crisis, shore up businesses and aid hospitals. While congressional leaders worked to send help, alarms were being sounded from coast to coast about the wave of coronavirus cases about to crash onto the nation's health system.

President Trump outlined on Sunday broad measures the federal government is taking to help combat the coronavirus pandemic in three states hardest by the contagion. Trump announced that he already had signed major disaster declarations for New York and Washington, and was planning on putting his signature on one he received earlier in the day from California Gov. Gavin Newsom. “I spoke with all three governors,” Trump said in the White House briefing room. “They’re very happy with what we’re doing.” CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE The president rattled off a list of supplies that crew already have sent to the states – including medical masks – and promised that more would be on the way soon. Trump also revealed for the first time the number of respirators and other personal protective equipment sent to the hard-hit states by the federal government.  He also said that the Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA] would be setting up medical stations in the three states to ease the burden caused by the coronavirus on local hospitals. In New York, FEMA will set up four large medical stations with 1,000 beds each, in California there will be eight large medical stations with 2,000 beds, and Washington state will receive three large stations with 750 beds and four small medical stations with 250 beds each, officials said. Trump also announced that the Navy’s medical ships – the USNS Mercy and Comfort – will be deployed to ports in states most affected by the pandemic. The Mercy will dock near Los Angeles, while Trump said the Comfort – once it’s finished with its maintenance – will most likely be sent to New York Harbor.  “The decision was made that USNS Mercy would have the greatest impact in California,” Trump said, adding that the ship should arrive in Southern California within a week. “The projected need for beds in California is five times that of Washington.” HOW TO PREVENT THE SPREAD As of Sunday evening, New York was the hardest-hit state in the nation by the coronavirus with more than 15,000 confirmed cases and 117 deaths. Washington state, the first to have to deal with the outbreak on a widespread basis, had over 1,700 confirmed cases, while Caifornia’s fast-growing outbreak saw more than 1,600, according to the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. Trump’s promise of help to the three states reeling most from the coronavirus came as critics said he initially responded too slowly to the outbreak and failed to use his power under the Defense Production Act to ramp up the output by companies producing medical equipment and supplies. Many states and municipalities have been pleading with the White House to invoke the act’s provisions before the virus spread more and overwhelmed some hospitals.  Officials in New York City, where the virus has spread rapidly in its tightly clustered neighborhoods, have warned that hospitals could run out of crucial supplies such as face masks by April. Trump, however, argued that he would use the act if needed, but so far has received an outpouring of support from private businesses looking to help. He added that invoking the act would amount to “nationalizing our businesses” and would “send tremors through our business community and our country.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “We are using it now, the fact that I signed it means it’s in effect,” Trump said. “We’re not big on nationalizing our businesses.” He added: “We have the threat of doing it if we need it…but it’s really working out very well.” Trump added that it’s up to states to try to get the materials first.  “We’re sort of a backup for states,” he said.

"                          Republican Kentucky senator Rand Paul tests positive for COVID-19 and will remain in quarantine, according to his official Twitter account. Calls to allow lawmakers to vote on legislation remotely grew significantly louder on Sunday, after Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., announced he had tested positive for coronavirus, and Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, revealed he and other senators recently ate lunch with Paul. Paul has been in quarantine in Kentucky and continuing to work, while staffers in his Washington, D.C., office have been working remotely for the past 10 days, Fox News has learned. Romney said later that his physician had instructed him to ""immediately self-quarantine and not to vote on the Senate floor."" Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, also revealed he would self-quarantine late Sunday, although he emphasized he would work as much as possible remotely. ""Coronavirus has now arrived here in the Senate,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on the Senate floor Sunday evening. ""There are at least five senators in self-quarantine."" McConnell said a planned 6 p.m. ET proceudral vote on a new coronavirus stimulus bill would go ahead. ""We need to signal to the public that we’re ready to get this job done,"" he said. ""And the way to do that is to vote aye in five minutes on cloture on the motion to proceed."" (Democrats ultimately shot down the bill by rejecting the procedural vote, angering Republicans who say they're playing politics to secure funding for unrelated measures during a national crisis.) Fox News is told both members and staff have been livid about why Senate Republicans continued to meet, en masse, and in-person for days as the coronavirus crisis worsened. In addition, some lawmakers from both parties were livid specifically with Paul.

Senate Democrats have conducted most of their meetings via conference call. While other Americans were practicing social distancing, Republicans kept pouring into the same rooms on a daily basis. ""We need to talk with the attending physician,"" said one senior GOP source, referring to Dr. Brian Monahan, the attending physician for the Capitol. ""And, Rand Paul."" Paul became the first member of the Senate known to have been infected with coronavirus, but Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., and Ben McAdams, D-Utah, also have tested positive, as have at least two congressional staffers. Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, tweeted after Paul's announcement a call for ""immediate"" procedural changes. ""The responsibility of the Senate is to remain operational,"" Schatz wrote. ""You are not protecting an institution by rendering it unable to function. Remote voting must be instituted immediately, so that the federal legislature can do its job, not just today, but for the duration of this crisis."" He continued: ""We may lack a quorum shortly if Leader [McConnell] doesn’t realize the urgency of remote voting. The Senate still has to do its job, but there’s simply no reason we have to do it in a bunch of gilded rooms and infect each other, endangering our ability to pass legislation."" Reps. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., and Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., echoed Schatz's message. ""I will keep @RandPaul in my thoughts & look forward to him getting well soon,"" Lieu wrote. ""Sen Paul says he was not aware of any direct contact with any infected person.

Added Dan Pfeiffer, a former top adviser in the Obama administration and podcast host: ""The House and Senate need a remote voting plan ASAP."" Pictures began circulating on social media Sunday of Paul eating lunch with other GOP senators on Friday, including Romney. A spokesman for Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., said Moran briefly saw Paul at the Senate gym Sunday morning and that he shared that information with GOP colleagues at a policy meeting. Moran ""followed CDC guidelines and kept a safe distance between him and Sen. Paul,'' spokesman Tom Brandt said. Moran has spoken with the attending physician at the Capitol and has been told he does not need to self-quarantine, Brandt said. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., was pictured eating with Paul last Friday, two days before Paul announced his diagnosis. Rubio ""shared the duration and nature of his interactions with Senator Paul with the Office of Attending Physician. It was determined they were low-risk interactions that do not require for self-quarantine,"" a Rubio spokesperson told Fox News. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the second-ranking Republican senator, said on the Senate floor that lawmakers will consult with the attending physician about all senators who have been in contact with Paul.       Sen.

Rob Portman, R-Ohio, last Thursday introduced a resolution to amend the chamber's rules to allow for remote voting in emergencies. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., also said in a letter to fellow Democrats that he expected the House to ""adjust our voting procedures"" in order to follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] recommendations limiting the number of people in any one gathering. The resolution introduced by Portman and Durbin would allow the Senate majority leader and the minority leader – currently Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. – to agree to allow ""secure remote voting"" in an emergency. The Senate then would be able to vote every 30 days to continue to allow remote voting. ""In times of a national emergency, the Senate must be able to convene and act expeditiously even if we can’t be together in person,"" Portman said in a statement. ""While I know there is resistance to changing a Senate tradition to allow for remote voting during national emergencies, I believe this is an important issue and worthy of robust discussion among our Senate colleagues.""

"                          The Senate is expected to vote on the massive, more than $1 trillion coronavirus stimulus package; Fox News correspondent Molly Henneberg reports. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi returned from the House's weeklong recess Sunday to announce that Democrats would be ""introducing our own bill"" to address the ongoing economic collapse amid the coronavirus -- frustrating Senate Republicans who have worked through their planned recess this week to craft emergency legislation. Pelosi reportedly was seeking a ""laundry list"" of items to be included in the emergency legislation, including wiping out up to $10,000 in student loan debt per person and securing election-security funding. ""It's on the Senate side now because that's their deadline for a vote, but we'll be introducing our own bill and hopefully it'll be compatible with what they discussed on the Senate,"" Pelosi told reporters early in the day. In a letter to fellow House Democrats issued Sunday afternoon, as Senate Republicans delayed a procedural vote on a stimulus bill, Pelosi remarked that Democrats had been making progress during their ""district work period,"" or time at home. Many Republicans have said Democrats wouldn't help them meet the 60-vote threshold needed for cloture. ""There is at this time a big difference between the Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act and what the Senate Republicans are proposing,"" Pelosi said. ""As the Senate continues to talk, we must continue to act For The People."" National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) senior adviser Matt Whitlock said he was outraged by Pelosi's handling of the situation. ""The Senate canceled recess to work at breakneck speed because people need help now. Pelosi waltzes in after the House has been on a week long vacation and says they’re going to do their own thing and the Senate’s Monday urgency is arbitrary. Just wild,"" he tweeted. Later, Whitlock took aim at Pelosi's letter, calling it disingenuous: ""Pelosi's mention of 'their work during the district work period' (AKA recess) is a pretty obvious attempt to draw attention away from the fact that the House was on vacation while the Senate hammered out a bipartisan Coronavirus response bill that she is now trying to tank."" RAND PAUL TESTS POSITIVE ""Can’t get over this,"" Whitlock wrote later. ""Members of the House and Senate have the virus. Numbers of cases are spiking around the country, and the economy is on the edge of ruin. And Pelosi comes back after a week long vacation saying the House is just doing their own thing. Outrageous."" ""Talking to some Senate GOP sources. They seem stunned and angry. I’m told there was lots of bipartisan input into the legislative outline & emerging specifics — including an agreement in principle on broad strokes. Then Pelosi showed up and threw a partisan grenade,"" TownHall.com political editor and Fox News contributor Guy Benson tweeted. Top-level negotiations between Congress and the White House teetered Sunday on a nearly $1.4 trillion economic rescue package, as the coronavirus crisis deepened and President Trump called for a deal to steady the hard-hit nation. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin indicated an agreement was within reach. But, faced with mounting opposition from Democrats who call the package insufficient, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell postponed a planned procedural vote Sunday, resetting it for 6 p.m. ET. ""Coronavirus has now arrived here in the Senate,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor Sunday evening. ""There are at least five senators in self-quarantine."" McConnell said the planned proceudral vote was an important step. ""We need to signal to the public that we’re ready to get this job done,"" he said. ""And the way to do that is to vote aye in five minutes on cloture on the motion to proceed."" But, Democrats have said the package did not go far enough to provide health care and unemployment aid for Americans, and catered too much to big business. Democrats ultimately shot down the bill by rejecting the procedural vote, angering Republicans who say they're playing politics to secure funding for unrelated measures during a national crisis. TOP DEM SLAMS DISABLED WOMAN BUYING, TOUTING GUNS: 'SICKENING' The urgency to act has been mounting, as jobless claims have risen, businesses have shuttered and the financial markets are set to re-open Monday eager for signs that Washington could soften the blow of the health-care crisis and what experts have warned could be a looming recession. At issue: how best to keep paychecks flowing for millions of workers abruptly sidelined by the crisis. Talks also narrowed on plans to aid hospitals and provide loans to airlines and other industries all but grounded by the national shutdown. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, a Democrat, said Sunday the auto industry also likely would need government assistance. Officials put the price tag at nearly $1.4 trillion and said that with other measures from the Federal Reserve, it could pump $2 trillion into the U.S. economy. Mnuchin said Sunday that workers and businesses will get assistance to help cover payrolls for the next 10 weeks; unemployment insurance; and a one-time “bridge payment” of about $3,000 for a family of four. The treasury secretary said a significant part of the package will involve working with the Federal Reserve for up to $4 trillion of liquidity to support the economy with “broad-based lending programs.” Hospitals, Mnuchin said, will get approximately $110 billion for the expected influx of sick patients. But, Democrats have pushed for add-ons including food security aid, small business loans and other measures for workers — including jobless aid for those in the so-called “gig” economy not traditionally eligible for unemployment checks. A senior aide for the Democrats, unauthorized to discuss the talks and speaking on condition of anonymity, said the package provided only three months of unemployment benefits, did not provide eviction protections and would a $500 billion ""corporate slush fund"" that did not institute enough restraints on how big business would spend the money. There also has been a $242 billion proposal for emergency supplemental food, hospital and public health needs, including for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Trump has said companies should not be able to use federal assistance to buy back stock in an effort to increase profits.

Rubio, one of the lead senators working on the relief package currently before the Senate, told Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that rather than taking appropriate steps to alert the world that there was a problem, they did the opposite.

The National Rifle Association (NRA) published a video this weekend showing Carletta Whiting, a breast-cancer survivor said to have a fibromyalgia-related disability, outlining her reasons for possessing firearms during the coronavirus pandemic -- and it didn't take long for a top Senate Democrat to call the message ""sickening."" The flare-up highlighted the ongoing disputes between some municipalities seeking to restrict Second Amendment rights, and others arguing that times of crisis were precisely the moments when gun rights needed to be protected. Police departments in major cities, including Philadelphia, already have abandoned making arrests for various offenses. New Orleans and other jurisdictions have assumed the power to ban gun transfers. ""What's in my control is how I defend myself if things go from bad to worse,"" Whiting said, before firing a 9MM round from her AR-9 rifle. ""I know from history how quickly society breaks down during a crisis, and we've never faced anything like this before, and never is the Second Amendment more important than during public unrest."" Whiting noted that ""even liberals in California"" were ""lining up because they know the government will not be able to protect them."" In mid-March, the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check (NICS) experienced a threefold jump in background-application processing compared to the same time period last year.

And, Virginia State Police saw 64,000 background check requests in February, compared to 39,300 last February. Nevertheless, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., slammed the video, and suggested that the NRA was urging gun-owners to avoid stockpiling food and other resources. In the video, Whiting argued that stockpiling only food alone was not sufficient. ""Mainstream gun owners have left the NRA, so now they’re reduced to telling people to stockpile assault weapons, instead of food, to get ready for the coming Coronavirus civil war,"" Murphy tweeted. ""So sickening."" In response, the NRA called Murphy's attack disingenuous, and part of a larger effort by Democrats to undermine gun rights. ""Sen. Murphy is either being intentionally disingenuous or is obtuse,"" the NRA's director of media relations, Amy Hunter, told Fox News. ""Carletta Whiting is one of millions of Americans who feel vulnerable and who know that when crime happens, the police are minutes away — despite their best intentions. ""Right now, anti-gun politicians are using the pandemic to try and strip Americans of their Second Amendment rights,"" Hunter continued. ""Meanwhile, gun sales are increasing because good people are worried their government won't be able to protect them. This is when Americans rely on their Second Amendment rights the most."" There has been some concern that the national supply of firearms and ammunition may not be able to meet the growing demand. ""Firearm retailers and manufacturers were not prepared to meet the surge or a sustained long-term demand, so firearms and ammunition will seem to be largely absent from dealer shelves for weeks to come,"" cautioned Eric Poole, the editor of Guns and Ammo magazine. ""If firearm and ammunition manufacturers throughout the U.S. are required to keep their workforce at home, this will have a more profound effect and drive up prices, to include private transfers of firearms and ammunition, which are not monitored or recorded by the NICS system.""

"                          Former Vice President Biden is confused yet again. As the country comes together to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, Biden seems to think that it was all President Trump’s fault. In a recent statement, he accuses the president of “dithering on preparing” for the pandemic, and “lying” about the federal government’s response. PETER NAVARRO: CORONAVIRUS – HOW BUSINESSES ARE STEPPING UP, COLLABORATING WITH TRUMP ADMINISTRATION Per usual, Biden is struggling with reality. So let’s take a walk down memory lane. On Jan. 21, the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in the United States. Just 10 days later, on Jan. 31, President Trump declared a public health emergency, implemented quarantines and announced a ban on travel to and from China. On the very same day, Biden called the president’s response “hysterical xenophobia”, and “fear-mongering”. To this day, Biden is STILL against travel bans of any kind — even though Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the bans saved us from untold amounts of suffering. In the days and weeks after Jan. 31, the Trump administration organized a massive public-private partnership, implemented brand new drive-up testing sites, engaged the U.S. military for support, cut red tape across the board to speed up research and development, and declared a national emergency. My message to Joe Biden is simple: If you refuse to be a part of the solution, you might consider heading to a church (reminder – it’s Sunday, not “Super Thursday”), and pray to… “you know the thing.”  The response is unprecedented, but pandemics are not. In April 2009, during the H1N1 outbreak (or N1H1, as Biden mistakenly called it), Obama’s Health and Human Services Department quickly declared a public health emergency. However, the Obama/Biden administration failed to declare a national emergency until October 2009. By that point, over 1,000 Americans had been killed by the disease and tens of thousands more were infected. In the first year of the H1N1 pandemic, nearly 13,000 Americans lost their lives. Ultimately, over 60 million Americans contracted the virus, and hundreds of thousands were hospitalized. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER The Obama/Biden administration NEVER implemented a mandatory quarantine. The Obama/Biden administration NEVER enacted a travel ban. The Obama/Biden administration NEVER created drive-up testing sites. Someone might want to remind Vice President Biden. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Clearly, he’s doesn’t remember his administration’s lackluster response in 2009, or perhaps, he still doesn’t understand the seriousness of a worldwide pandemic. Because now, instead of lending support, he’s using this crisis as a political weapon. In fact, his campaign is fundraising off of COVID-19. Yes, Biden is actually trying to raise money in the middle of a pandemic. My message to Joe Biden is simple: If you refuse to be a part of the solution, you might consider heading to a virtual church (reminder – it’s Sunday, not “Super Thursday”), and pray to… “you know the thing” (God the Creator of everything). Or, perhaps, you could just ask your son, Hunter “Zero experience” Biden, for some of his millions, so you can travel the world, and let the adults respond to this crisis in a serious manner. By the way, if you’re wondering who to blame for the outbreak, ask your son. I hear he knows a lot about the country of China. And while you’re at it, you can ask them how Hunter got that lucrative deal with the Bank of China.

"                          Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blasts Democrats over failing to move forward with coronavirus relief package. Senate Democrats late Sunday blocked the $1.3 trillion economic rescue package Republicans say would help businesses and families hurt financially by the coronavirus outbreak, prompting U.S. stock futures to fall 5 percent and sparking a new wave of uncertainty that the two sides can get together and forge an agreement. CHAD PERGRAM: WHAT HAPPENS NOW IN THE SENATE? Democrats insist that President Trump and Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., are using the funds to put corporations ahead of families. The attempt to advance the legislation stalled in a 47-47 vote. Sixty votes were needed to pass.  Many Americans are facing unforeseen hardships after the coronavirus outbreak hit the country and temporarily closed businesses. The stimulus was championed by Trump, who said Saturday that the package was very close to being a done deal. McConnell blasted his Democrat colleagues and accused them of being influenced by Sen. Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. ""I want everybody to fully understand if we aren't able to act tomorrow, it will be because of our colleagues on the other side continuing to dicker when the country expects us to come together and address the problem,"" McConnell said on the floor. Democrats risk being portrayed by Trump as politically bent on stopping him at any cost. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said the move by Democrats is ""irresponsible and unwise."" ""They are playing with fire,"" she said, according to the New York Times. McConnell’s office said early Monday that three votes are expected later Monday after his remarks at around noon.  The Sunday vote came while at least five GOP senators were in self-quarantine, including Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who became the first U.S. senator to announce he tested positive for the virus. Many Democrats complained that the draft aid package did not go far enough to provide health care and unemployment aid for Americans, and failed to put restraints on a proposed $500 billion ""slush fund"" for corporations. They said the ban on corporate stock buy-backs are weak and the limits on executive pay would last only two years. LATEST CORONAVIRUS NEWS ""They’re trying to advance a proposal that would be great for giant corporations and leave everyone else behind,"" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, according to the Wall Street Journal. Democrats also pushed for add-ons including food security aid, small business loans and other measures for workers — saying the three months of unemployment insurance offered under the draft plan was insufficient. Schumer, the Senate minority leader, said the draft package ""significantly cut back our hospitals, our cities, our states, our medical workers and so many others needed in this crisis."" MARK LEVIN: PEOPLE ARE SICK AND DYING AND PELOSI IS PLAYING GAMES Pelosi, D-Calif., urged colleagues to ""take responsibility"" as Democrats prepared their own draft. The House had just returned from a weeklong recess. After the bill failed to move forward, McConnell tore into Democrats, accusing them of backing out of a bipartisan agreement once Pelosi and Schumer intervened. He claimed Pelosi took ""a week off"" and ""poured cold water on the whole process."" ""She's the Speaker of the House, not the Speaker of the Senate,"" McConnell said, according to Politico. ""We were doing just fine until that intervention."" Schumer was in touch with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin late into the night Sunday to negotiate the plans. Their last meeting was at 11: 45 p.m. inside Schumer’s officer in the Capitol. We’re closer now than we were in the past 48 hours to an agreement, Schumer said. “Can we overcome the remaining disagreements in the next 24 hours? Yes. We can and should.”  Earlier, Mnuchin told “Fox News Sunday” that he was looking forward to wrapping up the package on Sunday.

"                          Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blasts Democrats over failing to move forward with coronavirus relief package. Senate Democrats late Sunday blocked a GOP-backed $1.3 trillion coronavirus rescue package as five Republicans watched helplessly from self-quarantine, prompting U.S. stock futures to dive and sowing fresh doubt the parties can forge an agreement as the nation descends into economic disaster. CHAD PERGRAM: WHAT HAPPENS NOW IN THE SENATE? Democrats insist that President Trump and Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., are using the funds to put corporations ahead of families. The attempt to advance the legislation stalled in a 47-47 vote. Sixty votes were needed to pass.  Many Americans are facing unforeseen hardships after the coronavirus outbreak hit the country and temporarily closed businesses. The stimulus was championed by Trump, who said Saturday that the package was very close to being a done deal. McConnell blasted his Democrat colleagues and accused them of being influenced by Sen. Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. ""I want everybody to fully understand if we aren't able to act tomorrow, it will be because of our colleagues on the other side continuing to dicker when the country expects us to come together and address the problem,"" McConnell said on the floor. Democrats risk being portrayed by Trump as politically bent on stopping him at any cost. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said the move by Democrats is ""irresponsible and unwise."" ""They are playing with fire,"" she said, according to the New York Times. McConnell’s office said early Monday that three votes are expected later Monday after his remarks at around noon.  The Sunday vote came while at least five GOP senators were in self-quarantine, including Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who became the first U.S. senator to announce he tested positive for the virus. Many Democrats complained that the draft aid package did not go far enough to provide health care and unemployment aid for Americans, and failed to put restraints on a proposed $500 billion ""slush fund"" for corporations. They said the ban on corporate stock buy-backs are weak and the limits on executive pay would last only two years. LATEST CORONAVIRUS NEWS ""They’re trying to advance a proposal that would be great for giant corporations and leave everyone else behind,"" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, according to the Wall Street Journal. Democrats also pushed for add-ons including food security aid, small business loans and other measures for workers — saying the three months of unemployment insurance offered under the draft plan was insufficient. Schumer, the Senate minority leader, said the draft package ""significantly cut back our hospitals, our cities, our states, our medical workers and so many others needed in this crisis."" MARK LEVIN: PEOPLE ARE SICK AND DYING AND PELOSI IS PLAYING GAMES Pelosi, D-Calif., urged colleagues to ""take responsibility"" as Democrats prepared their own draft. The House had just returned from a weeklong recess. After the bill failed to move forward, McConnell tore into Democrats, accusing them of backing out of a bipartisan agreement once Pelosi and Schumer intervened. He claimed Pelosi took ""a week off"" and ""poured cold water on the whole process."" ""She's the Speaker of the House, not the Speaker of the Senate,"" McConnell said, according to Politico. ""We were doing just fine until that intervention."" Schumer was in touch with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin late into the night Sunday to negotiate the plans. Their last meeting was at 11: 45 p.m. inside Schumer’s officer in the Capitol. We’re closer now than we were in the past 48 hours to an agreement, Schumer said. “Can we overcome the remaining disagreements in the next 24 hours? Yes. We can and should.”  Earlier, Mnuchin told “Fox News Sunday” that he was looking forward to wrapping up the package on Sunday. He said that the government will provide direct deposits, with an average family of four receiving approximately $3,000, as well as “enhanced unemployment insurance” for those laid off due to the outbreak.

"                          The ‘Fox News Sunday’ panel weighs in. As the coronavirus threat has grown more alarming in many parts of the U.S. and a third coronavirus response bill stalled in the Senate Sunday night, many Democratic politicians have ratcheted up their criticism of President Trump as he seeks to gain control of the crisis. The barbs have come from the campaign trail, from governors' mansions and mayors' offices — and few have teed up warnings as dire as New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who on Sunday said ""people will die"" if Trump doesn't give the city further help. ""The president of the United States is from New York City and he will not lift a finger to help his hometown,” de Blasio said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" Sunday. ""I don’t get it."" CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW       New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, with Dr. Oxiris Barbot, commissioner of the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, reports on the preparedness for the potential spread of the coronavirus on Feb. 26, 2020. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File)       DE BLASIO: IF TRUMP DOES NOT ACT ON CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK, 'PEOPLE WILL DIE' He continued: ""If the president doesn’t act, people will die who could have lived otherwise."" For their part, Democrats are facing heavy criticism from GOP colleagues after blocking the aid bill overnight. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said the move by Democrats is ""irresponsible and unwise."" ""They are playing with fire,"" she said, according to The New York Times. Mayor de Blasio asked Trump to bring in the military to fight the coronavirus in hotspots like New York City, which is where about one-third of the coronavirus cases in the U.S. currently are. ""I guarantee you they're ready to serve, but the president has to give the order,"" the mayor said, blaming Trump for keeping the military's ""logistical"" resource on the sidelines. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker also slammed Trump Sunday, saying Trump's apparent decision to call the coronavirus the ""Chinese virus"" is ""profoundly un-American."" ""People from every demographic, every race, ethnicity, gender or background have been infected. Suggesting otherwise or engaging in racist speech or acts is one of the most profoundly un-American things that I can think of,"" Pritzker said of Trump. ""The current crisis should drive home to all of us just how connected we all are. We can choose how we want to come out on the other side of this — let's choose to be one Illinois."" Trump has repeatedly stood by his ""Chinese virus"" terminology and others in his administration have also called the coronavirus variations of the ""Wuhan virus"" and the ""Chinese coronavirus"" in an apparent effort to counteract a Chinese propaganda campaign trying to shift responsibility for the pandemic to the United States. The coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China, and its spread was exacerbated by early mishandling and lack of transparency by the Chinese government. Pritzker also targeted Trump online after the president picked him out by name as a member of ""a very small group of certain other Governors"" who ""shouldn’t be blaming the Federal Government for their own shortcomings."" COLLINS BLASTS DEMOCRATS FOR BLOCKING CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS PLAN, SAYS THEY'RE 'PLAYING WITH FIRE' Pritzker shot back: ""You wasted precious months when you could've taken action to protect Americans & Illinoisans. You should be leading a national response instead of throwing tantrums from the back seat. Where were the tests when we needed them? Where's the PPE? Get off Twitter & do your job."" Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot also stepped into the fray, accusing Trump of ""yammering about hoaxes and fake news."" Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, in an interview with ""Fox News Sunday,"" also panned Trump's coronavirus response when asked about a tweet from earlier last week when Trump called her the ""Failing Michigan Governor"" and said she needed to be ""more proactive."" FAUCI CITES TRUMP TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS AS POSSIBLE KE FOR U.S. NOT 'BECOMING ANOTHER ITALY' ""He’s responding to my criticism that they didn’t do the preparation that they needed to do on the front end,"" she said. ""That’s why we have a shortage of tests. That’s why we have people who don’t take this seriously — because for a long time we were told that it wasn’t to be taken seriously. This is what we're up against."" And from the campaign trail, Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden, who is likely to face Trump in the November general election, launched repeated attacks not only on the administration's immediate handling of the coronavirus threat but also on the bill being supported by Trump and Senate Republicans as a third-phase coronavirus response. ""Mr. President, stop lying and start acting,"" Biden said in a statement, specifically mentioning Trump's reluctance to use the Defense Production Act to mobilize the private sector to build the equipment hospitals and doctors will need to battle the coronavirus. ""Use the full extent of your authorities, now, to ensure that we are producing all essential goods and delivering them where they need to go."" Trump invoked the Defense Production Act last week but initially said he didn't plan to use it, citing voluntary work by the private sector to meet medical professionals' needs. He later, during a phone conversation with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, gave the order to his staff to begin using his powers under the act, though it is not clear what exactly he is ordering produced to fight the pandemic. Biden then launched a broadside against Trump and the Senate GOP as their bill failed to clear a vote on a procedural hurdle Sunday night, after being blocked by Democrats. ""Here’s what’s happening. The White House and the Senate Republicans have proposed a $500 billion slush fund for corporations, with almost no conditions. Donald Trump’s Treasury Secretary would decide which big businesses get how much, and he can give out billions with virtually no strings attached,"" Biden said. ""The Trump Administration could even allow companies to use taxpayers’ money for stock buybacks and executive pay packages, and they don’t have to tell Americans where the money is going for months,"" he continued. Biden's rhetoric echoes that from Senate Democrats and Schumer on the problems in the Senate coronavirus bill, despite Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's pleas for lawmakers to hold their noses and vote for it for the sake of Americans' confidence in their lawmakers and for the stock market — futures fell significantly Sunday night after the procedural vote on the bill failed. MNUCHIN CONFIDENT THAT STIMULUS PACKAGE WILL KEEP ECONOMY AFLOAD UNTIL CORONAVIRUS PASSES Criticism from Trump on the coronavirus has also come from the likes of Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, who said on MSNBC Sunday ""I'm not a socialist like Donald Trump,"" in response to Republicans' efforts to prop up companies hit hard by the coronavirus-induced economic slowdown, potentially taking an equity stake in companies it gives money to. ""I think that rather than these corporate bailouts we should be talking about helping people,"" Polis said. ""That means workers, that means small business owners, that means everybody."" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has repeatedly said what the administration wants are not bailouts, citing the apparently temporary nature of the current economic downturn and saying that the economy and these companies just need some temporary liquidity until the spread of the coronavirus is medically under control. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., also took shots at Trump Sunday, both for the GOP plan to spend hundreds of billions of dollars helping corporations with liquidity and for moving forward with its effort to strike down the Affordable Care Act -- also known as Obamacare -- in the courts. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""Outrageous,"" Harris said in a tweet. ""We are in the middle of a global pandemic and Donald Trump wants to strip health care from millions of Americans. This is why we fight."" All of this criticism comes after a couple of weeks of relative unity as politicians worked to fight the coronavirus. Trump last week even earned praise from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., over his coronavirus response. But it appears the honeymoon is over. With the Senate likely to vote again on its coronavirus relief package again Monday and more time on national television during the daily coronavirus task force briefing, Trump will be faced with a tough political road ahead as he and Republicans quibble with Democrats over the best way to fight the coronavirus pandemic.

"                          The choices we make as individuals will collectively make a big difference to the pandemic, says Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Trying to jumpstart a campaign that’s been suspended in time for nearly a week due to the coronavirus outbreak, former Vice President Joe Biden plans to deliver Monday the first of his own briefings on the global pandemic. On Sunday evening, the all-but-certain Democratic presidential nominee held a virtual fundraiser from his home in Wilmington, Del., and he told donors, “They put in a new high-speed line into my home, they've converted a recreation room, basically, into a television studio. So beginning tomorrow, I guess tomorrow, I'm making the first presentation.” THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN Biden is picking up the pace as he steps up his criticism of President Trump over what he charges was a lack of leadership from the Republican incumbent in the past two months as the coronavirus threat rose.  The former vice president also slammed the president and Senate Republican leaders over Sunday’s impasse on a nearly $2 trillion stimulus package to help workers, small businesses and large companies devastated by the economic collapse caused by the pandemic — though Democratic leaders took heat from GOP colleagues for blocking that bill. Biden's move to essentially hold his own briefings amid the coronavirus pandemic is unusual, considering they are sure to offer a starkly different message than the daily briefings out of the White House during a time of national emergency. But they also come as the former vice president must keep a high profile, asserting himself as the presumptive nominee even as the numerous primary delays tied to the pandemic prevent him from officially locking down the nomination and beating lone remaining rival Bernie Sanders. Biden had been on a roll – zooming past Sen. Sanders in late February and early this month to take a commanding lead in the race for convention delegates. But as he swept last Tuesday’s contests in Florida, Illinois, and Arizona – cementing his status as the likely nominee and all but closing the populist senator from Vermont’s extremely narrow path to win the nomination – the nation’s focus was squarely on the coronavirus as the death toll and number of Americans infected with the COVID-19 disease surged. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK The former vice president was relegated to giving a low-quality webcast speech from his Wilmington, Del., home. Since then Biden’s mostly disappeared from the headlines while the president’s been a daily and controversial fixture at the White House briefings on the federal response to the coronavirus outbreak “Joe Biden is reduced to being on the sideline,” veteran GOP consultant and Fox News contributor Karl Rove said on ""Fox News Sunday."" “This kind of sustained nationwide lockdown is unprecedented and shows the benefit of incumbency. The president can get media attention every day. Given his erratic performance, that’s not always a good thing, but it at least keeps him in the public eye through the media in a way that no one else can,” Mo Elleithee, the founding executive director of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service and a Fox News contributor, noted. But Biden used those appearances by Trump to take aim at the president on Friday during a conference call with political reporters. “President Trump, stop saying false things, will you? People are worried. They are really frightened. And when these things don’t come true, you just exacerbate their concern. Stop saying false things [you] think make you sound like a hero,” Biden said. In a statement on Sunday, Biden charging that “President Trump’s dithering on preparing us for this global pandemic and his lies about his response to this dangerous crisis is one of the most unjustifiable failures of presidential leadership in American history.” And Biden’s campaign is going up with a new digital video on Facebook and Instagram in crucial general election battleground states that paints a stark contrast between the president’s combative tone with a reporter at a White House briefing last week and Biden’s answer to a similar question asked at a presidential primary debate eight days ago. The video ends with the words on screen: “This moment calls for a president. In November, you can elect one.” Trump’s reelection campaign is firing back, accusing Biden of trying to politicize the crisis. ""By preying upon Americans’ fear amid the coronavirus outbreak, Biden isn’t just playing cheap politics. He’s making the crisis worse. It’s dangerous,” the campaign said in an email. ""Biden's Monday morning quarterbacking is an effort to sow anger and division among Americans."" The video – and likelihood of near-daily on-camera briefings – are all signs the candidate and his campaign are reasserting themselves.  Also likely in the works: an uptick in virtual town halls and fundraisers and other forms of digital campaigning. “The fact that this is happening in the digital era means that Biden doesn’t need to rely on traditional tactics. He  can create his own opportunities to talk with voters directly, going around the media. Ads aren’t enough. He has an opportunity to draw a contrast with the president by exhibiting leadership, and addressing people’s concerns, as opposed to dismissing them,” noted Elleithee, a senior spokesman for Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign who later served as communications director for the Democratic National Committee. And he stressed that Biden “just needs to start seizing those opportunities more frequently.” Biden also acknowledged he’s getting ready to begin considering the biggest decision he’ll make as his party’s standard-bearer – choosing a running mate. “I have to start that vetting process relatively soon, meaning in a matter of weeks,"" Biden said Sunday during his virtual fundraiser. “I think there will be a group that is in excess of six or seven people that I look at.” And after a brief lull, Biden is also picking up the pace on raising campaign cash, holding near-daily virtual fundraisers. But there’s a catch — Biden’s not the nominee just yet. Although nearly mathematically eliminated, Sanders has yet to drop out of the race. And with many of the upcoming primaries postponed as most Americans huddle in their homes as they try and ride out the pandemic, Biden won’t be reaching the 1,991 convention delegates needed to clinch the nomination any time soon.

"                          Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A Justice Department spokesperson issued a clarification overnight regarding a recent “emergency powers” request to Congress involving prolonged pre-trial incarceration during the coronavirus crisis that drew a backlash on social media. The DOJ claimed that there had been “confusion” after Politico and Rolling Stone wrote that the department was seeking new ""emergency powers"" for itself that would “suspend” certain rights in criminal matters. In reality, the spokeswoman said, judges would be the ones to determine whether a defendant could be held in custody for longer than normally permitted. FBI RAISES EYEBROWS AFTER SAYING IT WOULD NOT ACCEPT ELECTRONIC FOIA REQUESTS DUE TO CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK “Bottom line: The proposed legislative text confers powers upon judges. It does not confer new powers upon the executive branch,” said a statement posted by DOJ spokeswoman Kerri Kupec early Monday morning. “These provisions are designed to empower the courts to ensure the fair and effective administration of justice.” The reports that the Trump administration was looking to infringe on rights by detaining people indefinitely during the outbreak led to bipartisan outrage from lawmakers including Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who simply tweeted, “OVER MY DEAD BODY” with a link to the Politico report. According to Kupec, this concern is unfounded. She said the proposed measures, which include suspending certain time limits in criminal cases, were the result of consulting with both the judiciary and Congress in order “to help federal judges more consistently manage the cases within their districts and to protect the interests of justice during this national emergency.” By suspending these limits, defendants would be able to be held in custody longer before trial and statutes of limitations would be put on hold, should a judge determine it is necessary and proper. Former Republican National Committee chair Michael Steele warned that doing this “is NOT a slope we want to get on,” especially with “this crew,” referring to the current DOJ. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Kupec reiterated that the power would not belong to the DOJ itself because the decisions would be made by judges. She also noted that nothing will change unless Congress approves the measures and, if they are approved, they would end once the emergency is over or a district’s chief judge determines that the emergency conditions are not substantially affecting how the courts are able to function.

"                          Republican Kentucky senator Rand Paul tests positive for COVID-19 and will remain in quarantine, according to his official Twitter account. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was on the receiving end of withering criticism from Senate colleagues after it appeared he was still tending to his typical business at the U.S. Capitol after being tested for the coronavirus — his results came back positive Sunday. Leading the charge was Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., who tweeted Sunday in reaction to a report from The New York Times that Paul was at the Senate gym that same morning, apparently just hours before he learned he had tested positive for coronavirus. ""I’ve never commented about a fellow Senator’s choices/actions. Never once,"" she said. ""This, America, is absolutely irresponsible. You cannot be near other people while waiting for coronavirus test results. It endangers others & likely increases the spread of the virus."" CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW DEMOCRATS SCORN TRUMP CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE AS SENATE REACHES IMPASSE ON THIRD AID BILL Sinema sounded off as it became clear lawmakers on both sides of the aisle were angry with not just Paul for sticking around while awaiting the test results but with the decision for Senate Republicans to be consistently meeting in person over the past weeks as Democrats largely took care of their business via conference call. ""We need to talk with the Attending Physician,"" one senior GOP source said, referring to Dr. Brian Monahan, the Attending Physician for the Capitol. ""And, Rand Paul."" Paul's office defended his actions Sunday as largely precautionary, implying the positive coronavirus diagnosis was a surprise. ""Similar to the President and the Vice President, Senator Rand Paul decided to get tested after attending an event where two individuals subsequently tested positive for COVID-19, even though he wasn't aware of any direct contact with either one of them,"" a statement from Paul Deputy Chief of Staff Sergio Gor said. ""Additionally, due to a prior lung injury, and subsequent surgery on his lung, Senator Paul is in a higher risk category as it relates to pulmonary issues."" SEN. RAND PAUL TESTS POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS A tweet from Paul's Twitter account further defended the Kentucky senator. ""We want to be clear, Senator Paul left the Senate IMMEDIATELY upon learning of his diagnosis,"" it said. ""He had zero contact with anyone & went into quarantine. Insinuations such as those below that he went to the gym after learning of his results are just completely false & irresponsible!"" But the criticism of the senator largely focused on his call not to self-quarantine while awaiting the test result. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Paul did have one high profile supporter amid the chorus of criticism he faced Sunday -- President Trump. ""My friend (always there when I’ve needed him!), Senator @RandPaul, was just tested 'positive' from the Chinese Virus. That is not good! He is strong and will get better. Just spoke to him and he was in good spirits,"" Trump said. Paul's office has said that he is in quarantine in Kentucky while continuing to work and that he has not shown any symptoms from the coronavirus. It also said that his D.C. staff had been working remotely for the past 10 days. Paul is one of five Senate Republicans in quarantine right now — meaning Republicans only hold a 48-47 Senate majority among those capable of voting in person as lawmakers try to hash out a coronavirus stimulus package.

"                          Republican Kentucky senator Rand Paul tests positive for COVID-19 and will remain in quarantine, according to his official Twitter account. The fate of a third coronavirus response bill -- a massive amalgam of stimulus checks and other economic aid -- has been only further clouded by the fact that five Republican senators remain stuck in quarantine. The package was blocked by Senate Democrats late Sunday, leading to fiery condemnations from GOP colleagues. But the math is made even harder for majority Republicans as more and more of their members are forced to the sidelines, unable to vote. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has been pushing the legislation in its current form, warned of the new obstacle at hand. AS RAND PAUL TESTS POSITIVE FOR COVID-19, CALLS FOR REMOTE VOTING INTENSIFY “Coronavirus has now arrived here in the Senate,” McConnell said Sunday evening from the Senate floor. “There are at least five senators in self-quarantine.” On Sunday, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., tested positive for COVID-19, after having spent much of the weekend on Capitol Hill engaged in working lunches and meetings over the stimulus package. Paul, who became the first member of the Senate known to be infected with coronavirus, has been in quarantine in Kentucky and continuing to work, while staffers in his Washington D.C. office have been working remotely for the past 10 days. But his diagnosis sent several other top GOP senators into self-quarantine. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said that his physician had instructed him to “immediately self-quarantine and not to vote on the Senate floor,"" after recently having lunch with Paul.       Sen.

Mike Lee, R-Utah, also revealed he would self-quarantine late Sunday, after apparently interacting with Paul, but emphasized he would work as much as possible remotely.       Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, is in self-quarantine after interacting with Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.      (AP) Meanwhile, Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., is also in self-quarantine, which he announced March 17, after having contact with a constituent who later tested positive. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., is also in self-quarantine, after having interacted with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who is being monitored for coronavirus. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., had been in self-quarantine, after attending an event at Mar-a-Lago earlier this month with Bolsonaro. Graham is no longer in self-quarantine. Amid calls from some corners for the Senate to allow remote voting, it remains unclear whether other members could soon be forced to sit out votes. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., was pictured eating with Paul on Friday, two days before Paul announced he had tested positive. But Rubio shared the duration and nature of his interactions with Paul with the Office of Attending Physician, and is not making any changes. “It was determined they were low-risk interactions that do not require self-quarantine,” a Rubio spokesperson told Fox News. And a spokesman for Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., said Moran briefly saw Paul at the Senate gym Sunday morning and that he shared that information with GOP colleagues at a policy meeting. Moran ""followed CDC guidelines and kept a safe distance between him and Sen. Paul,'' spokesman Tom Brandt said. “Moran has spoken with the attending physician at the Capitol and has been told he does not need to self-quarantine.” Paul’s diagnosis not only has key members quarantined but also has members and their staff livid over Senate GOP arrangements for meetings. Senate Republicans continued to meet, en masse, and in person on the Hill for days as the coronavirus crisis worsened, Fox News has learned. For days, Senate Republicans met in large numbers in the Mike Mansfield Room in the Capitol, the Kennedy Caucus Room and the Central Hearing Facility in the Hart Senate Office Building. While Americans, and most Senate Democrats, were social distancing, Republicans continued to attend meetings in the same rooms on a daily basis. PELOSI, RETURNING FROM RECESS, ANNOUNCES HOUSE DEMOCRATS WILL HAVE THEIR OWN CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE BILL  “We need to talk with the Attending Physician,” one senior GOP source, referring o Dr. Brian Monahan, the attending physician for the Capitol, told Fox News. “And, Rand Paul.” Senate Democrats, however, took precautions and conducted most of their meetings via conference call. At this point, there are no Democratic senators who have tested positive for coronavirus, or who are self-quarantined. Under normal circumstances, the Senate breakdown is 53 Republicans and 47 senators who caucus with the Democrats. But with five Republican senators quarantined, the GOP barely has a majority in the upper chamber at 48 Republican senators to 47 Democratic senators. The attempt to advance the legislation Sunday stalled in a 47-47 vote. Sixty votes were needed to pass. Fox News was told last week that the crunch to finish all of the coronavirus legislation was a race against the clock. “We need to finish everything before everyone up here gets sick,” one source told Fox News last week. But as the virus has made its way to the Senate, calls for remote voting have intensified. “The responsibility of the Senate is to remain operational. You are not protecting an institution by rendering it unable to function,” Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, tweeted after learning of Paul’s diagnosis. “Remote voting must be instituted immediately, so that the federal legislature can do its job, not just today, but for the duration of this crisis."" Meanwhile, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., echoed a similar message Sunday, as Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., and Ben McAdams, D-Utah, also tested positive, as well as at least two congressional staffers. “Congress needs remote voting. Period. Full stop,” Stefanik tweeted. “We must effectively modernize & govern during this time of unprecedented global health crisis. This can and should be temporary “We have 21st century technology and we need to use it to protect our communities now.” Meanwhile, on Monday, negotiations on the third phase of the stimulus are expected to continue, with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin slated to meet with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer. The Senate failed to move forward with the legislation on Sunday, as Democrats opposed the plan, partly because top senators Paul, Romney, Scott, Lee and Gardner were self-quarantined and McConnell was unable to garner crucial support from Democrats. McConnell is hoping to try again Monday to advance the legislation. SENATE FAILS TO MOVE FORWARD ON PHASE THREE BILL AMID DEM OPPOSITION Many Democrats had complained that the draft aid package did not go far enough to provide health care and unemployment aid for Americans, and failed to put restraints on a proposed $500 billion ""slush fund"" for corporations, saying the ban on corporate stock buy-backs are weak and the limits on executive pay would last only two years. Officials put the price tag of the rescue package at nearly $1.4 trillion and said that with other measures from the Federal Reserve it could pump $2 trillion into the U.S. economy. The draft legislation would provide payments of up to $1,200 per person. They would be phased down at adjusted gross income thresholds of $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 per couple. Additionally, there would be $500 payments for each child. The amount is reduced to zero for single taxpayers with incomes exceeding $99,000 and $198,000 for joint filers. Central to the package is as much as $350 billion for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home, and billions in loans to airlines and other industries. But on the other side of the Capitol, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said House Democrats would be “introducing our own bill” to address the economic crisis amid the coronavirus outbreak, frustrating many GOP senators who worked throughout the week to craft the emergency legislation. ""It's on the Senate side now because that's their deadline for a vote, but we'll be introducing our own bill and hopefully it'll be compatible with what they discussed on the Senate,"" Pelosi said.

"                          Republican Rep. Bill Johnson weighs in on what to expect from the upcoming vote. A meeting for a South Florida city government exploded into a shouting match over the city's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, leading the mayor to storm out of the room as one commissioner accused her and the city manager of failing to close the city's beaches and shutting off peoples' utilities in the midst of the outbreak. The Lake Worth Beach city commission meeting, which took place last Thursday night, began to unravel when one commissioner attempted to call a vote on the issue of which city leader holds emergency powers, according to The Palm Beach Post. But Commissioner Omari Hardy, who is running for a seat in the Florida statehouse, accused the commissioner of not following the proper procedures for calling a vote before asking ""Are you telling me that you're going to keep me from talking right now?"" ""You've talked all evening,"" a third commissioner shot back, setting Hardy off on a loud rant.

Mayor Pam Triolo and another commissioner attempted to stop Hardy, but he only kept yelling. ""This gentleman has had the ability to do any number of things,"" Hardy bellowed, pointing aggressively. ""We could have banned large gatherings, we could have closed the beach. We could have put a moratorium on utility shut-offs.""

"                          Republican Kentucky senator Rand Paul tests positive for COVID-19 and will remain in quarantine, according to his official Twitter account. Several GOP senators have been forced into self-quarantine after either contracting the novel coronavirus, or interacting with individuals who have tested positive. Here is a list of Republican senators who are currently in, or have been in self-quarantine amid the COVID-19 outbreak: Sen. Rand Paul Sen. Rand Paul tested positive for coronavirus on Sunday and is under self-quarantine at his home in Kentucky. “Senator Rand Paul has tested positive for COVID-19. He is feeling fine and is in quarantine,” Paul's staff tweeted Sunday afternoon. “He is asymptomatic and was tested out of an abundance of caution due to his extensive travel and events. He was not aware of any direct contact with any infected person.” ""He expects to be back in the Senate after his quarantine period ends and will continue to work for the people of Kentucky at this difficult time,"" a second tweet said. ""Ten days ago, our D.C. office began operating remotely, hence virtually no staff has had contact with Senator Rand Paul.” His team later tweeted: ""We want to be clear, Senator Paul left the Senate IMMEDIATELY upon learning of his diagnosis. He had zero contact with anyone & went into quarantine. Insinuations such as those below that he went to the gym after learning of his results are just completely false & irresponsible!"" Sen. Mitt Romney Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, had lunch with Paul over the weekend amid negotiations over the stimulus package.       Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, pauses to speak to media as he arrives for a briefing on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, March, 12, 2020, on the coronavirus outbreak. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)       Romney said that his physician had instructed him to “immediately self-quarantine and not to vote on the Senate floor, after recently having lunch with Paul. Sen. Mike Lee Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said he would self-quarantine late Sunday, after apparently interacting with Paul, but emphasized he would work as much as possible remotely. ""Upon learning that my colleague Sen. Paul tested positive for COVID-19, I consulted the attending physician of the U.S. Congress,” Lee said Sunday. “He advised me that because I have no symptoms or other risk factors, a COVID-19 test was not warranted. However, given the timing, proximity, and duration of my exposure to Sen. Paul, he directed me to self-quarantine for 14 days.”       Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, is in self-quarantine after interacting with Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.      (AP) Lee added: “That means no traveling or voting. But, I will continue to make sure Utah's voice is heard as we shape the federal response to the coronavirus through phone, text, email and whatever other means are available.” Sen. Cory Gardner Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., is in self-quarantine, which he announced March 17. Gardner had contact with a constituent who later tested positive for coronavirus. “While I am not showing any symptoms at this time, I have made the decision to self-quarantine out of an abundance of caution with an effective date of March 11th at the recommendation of the Tri-County Health Department,” Gardner said in a statement last week. Sen. Rick Scott Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., is also in self-quarantine, after having interacted with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who is being monitored for coronavirus. Scott has said he was feeling fine after interacting with Bolsonaro but was self-quarantining out of an abundance of caution. “I’m doing this out of precaution,” Scott told Fox News’ Neil Cavuto. “I want to make sure that I don’t have an adverse impact on anybody else. So, my doctors have told me that I have a low risk, that I don’t need a test since I don’t have any symptoms.” Sen. Lindsey Graham Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., was in self-quarantine after attending an event at Mar-a-Lago earlier this month with Bolsonaro and a member of the Brazilian president’s delegation who later tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Graham was tested for COVID-19, and revealed last week that his test was negative, after having been in self-quarantine. ""I was just informed by [Dr. Monahan], the head of the House Physicians Office, that my coronavirus test was NEGATIVE. I am very grateful and like everyone else will follow the best practices to stay negative,"" Graham tweeted. ""I look forward to getting back to work with my Senate colleagues and President Trump to contain this virus and stabilize our economy. Thank you very much for all the prayers and well wishes!” Sen. Ted Cruz Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, was in self-quarantine earlier this month after having attended the Conservative Political Action Conference outside of Washington, D.C., after an attendee later tested positive. CPAC ATTENDEE WITH CORONAVIRUS HAD CONTACT WITH 'SEVERAL' MEMBERS OF CONGRESS: PHYSICIAN Cruz later extended his self-quarantine after having come into contact with the head of Spain’s Vox Party, Santiago Abascal, who tested positive for coronavirus.

"                          Reaction from Peter Morici, business professor at the University of Maryland and former chief economist for the U.S. International Trade Commission. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday vowed that the Trump administration and lawmakers on Capitol Hill are “going to get this done,” after a massive coronavirus response bill was blocked over the weekend. Mnuchin, talking to reporters on Monday after meeting with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., seemed confident that an agreement would be reached on the more than $1 trillion stimulus package by the end of the day. SENATE REPUBLICANS STUCK IN QUARANTINE AS CHAOS UNFOLDS OVER CORONAVIRUS BILL “We knocked off a bunch of things on the list already and we’re closing out issues,” Mnuchin said. “We’re going to get this done today,” Mnuchin continued. “Everybody is working very hard so we look forward to a big vote today.” When asked when he expected to have a final agreement with both Senate Republicans and Democrats, Mnuchin said: “As fast as we can.” Mnuchin’s comments come after the Senate failed to move forward on the third part of legislation that would provide economic relief to American families and businesses amid the coronavirus outbreak, as Democrats opposed the plan, and several top Republicans remained in self-quarantine. On Sunday, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., announced he had tested positive for COVID-19, sending Sens. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Mitt Romney, R-Utah, into self-quarantine after interacting with Paul throughout the weekend. Paul, Lee, and Romney joined Sens. Rick Scott, R-Fla., and Cory Gardner, R-Co., in self-quarantine. Scott, out of an abundance of caution, put himself in quarantine after meeting with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. A member of Bolsonaro’s staff tested positive for the virus. Gardner went into self-quarantine on March 17 after interacting with a constituent who, also, later tested positive. Under normal circumstances, the Senate breakdown is 53 Republicans and 47 senators who caucus with the Democrats. But with five Republican senators quarantined, the GOP barely has a majority in the upper chamber, at 48 Republican senators to 47 Democratic senators. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is hoping to try again Monday to advance the legislation.

"                          Treasury Secretary Mnuchin pushes back on criticism that part of the package is a slush fund; Mike Emanuel reports from Capitol Hill. Republicans are accusing Democrats of using the coronavirus pandemic as an opportunity to push unrelated political agendas, as the two sides failed to reach an agreement Sunday night to advance legislation that would provide relief to American businesses and families struggling as a result of the outbreak. Democrats overnight blocked the massive economic rescue package, teeing up new negotiations Monday morning. But issues having nothing to do with coronavirus have become impediments to the relief package, according to a senior Republican aide. SENATE REPUBLICANS STUCK IN QUARANTINE AS CHAOS UNFOLDS OVER CORONAVIRUS BILL “As Leader Schumer continues to hold up the desperately-needed relief package, the last-minute list of demands from Pelosi’s and Schumer’s ideological wish list are coming into focus,” the aide said. These include new collective bargaining powers for unions, higher fuel emissions standards for airlines, and expanded wind and solar tax credits. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., confirmed this on Twitter Monday morning after the same information was tweeted by TownHall.com political editor and Fox News contributor Guy Benson. ""This report is correct. Pelosi & Schumer are willing to risk your life, your job, your retirement savings for a radical, left-wing wish list that has nothing to do with this virus,"" Cotton said. ""Disgraceful."" “Not only are these completely unrelated to the coronavirus epidemic, they could prevent companies from participating in the loan programs altogether—directly causing unnecessary layoffs,” the aide said. After House Majority Whip Rep. Jim Clyburn, was reported by The Hill to have said that this is ""a tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., warned against using the “Phase 3” coronavirus relief package as a political opportunity. “That’s not what this is about,"" McConnell said. ""This is not about unrelated policy changes, this is about direct assistance to the American people and to small businesses and to hospitals and others who are in need because we in government at all levels, in order to deal with this pandemic, have basically shut the economy down.” PELOSI, RETURNING FROM RECESS, ANNOUNCES HOUSE DEMS WILL HAVE THEIR OWN CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE BILL The Republican aide said the new Democratic demands arose after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi returned to Washington, D.C. from a weeklong House recess. Pelosi said the House would introduce their own bill as she was reportedly seeking a ""laundry list"" of items to be included in the emergency legislation, including wiping out up to $10,000 in student loan debt per person and securing election-security funding. Other add-ons that Democrats including Pelosi have pushed for include food security aid, small business loans, and other measures for workers, The Associated Press reported, though these are more closely related to the crisis at hand. Democrats including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., also claimed to have problems with the existing draft of the bill, arguing that the plan put forth by Senate Republicans was tilted toward corporations and did too little to help workers and health care providers. Many Democrats had complained that the draft aid package did not go far enough to provide health care and unemployment aid for Americans, and failed to put restraints on a proposed $500 billion ""slush fund"" for corporations, saying the ban on corporate stock buy-backs are weak and the limits on executive pay would last only two years.

Huge amounts of corporate bailout funds without restrictions or without oversight -- you wouldn’t even know who is getting the money. Not enough money for hospitals, nurses, PPE, masks, all the health care needs. No money for state and local government, many of whom would go broke. Many other things,” Schumer said. Earlier Sunday, it had seemed that the two sides were close to an agreement. While McConnell had recognized that there was still ""elbowing and maneuvering for room"" taking place, the legislation had bipartisan support including from ""a lot of rank-and-file Democrats who were involved in drafting it.""

Amy Klobuchar announced Monday that her husband has tested positive for coronavirus and that he is currently being treated in a Virginia hospital. Klobuchar, D-Minn., a former Democratic presidential hopeful, said her husband received the results of his COVID-19 test on Monday morning. THESE US SENATORS ARE IN QUARANTINE OVER CORONAVIRUS THREAT “While I cannot see him and he is of course cut off from all visitors, our daughter Abigail and I are constantly calling and texting and emailing,” Klobuchar said in a statement. “We love him very much and pray for his recovery.” Klobuchar said that her husband is “exhausted and sick but a very strong and resilient person.” Klobuchar described her husband’s symptoms, saying he “kept having a temperature and a bad, bad, cough.” “When he started coughing up blood, he got a test and a chest X-ray and they checked him into a hospital in Virginia because of a variety of things including very low oxygen levels which haven’t really improved,” she explained. “He now has pneumonia and is on oxygen but not a ventilator.” Klobuchar explained that she and her husband have “been in different places for the last two weeks” and that she is “outside the 14-day period for getting sick.” She added that her doctor has advised her not to get tested for COVID-19. “As everyone is aware, there are test shortages for people who need them everywhere and I don’t qualify to get one under any standard,” she said. “I love my husband so very much and not being able to be there at the hospital by his side is one of the hardest things about this disease.” MNUCHIN VOWS 'WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS DONE' AFTER CORONAVIRUS BILL BLOCKED She added: “I hope he will be home soon. I know so many Americans are going through this and so much worse right now. So I hope and pray for you, just as I hope you will do for my husband. Meanwhile I am working in the Senate to get help to the American people.” Klobuchar's announcement comes after Sen.

"                          The choices we make as individuals will collectively make a big difference to the pandemic, says Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Trying to jumpstart a campaign that’s been suspended in time for nearly a week due to the coronavirus outbreak, former Vice President Joe Biden plans to deliver Monday the first of his own briefings on the pandemic. On Sunday evening, the all-but-certain Democratic presidential nominee held a virtual fundraiser from his home in Wilmington, Del., and he told donors, “They put in a new high-speed line into my home, they've converted a recreation room, basically, into a television studio. So beginning tomorrow, I guess tomorrow, I'm making the first presentation.” THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN Biden is picking up the pace as he steps up his criticism of President Trump over what he charges was a lack of leadership from the Republican incumbent in the past two months as the coronavirus threat rose.  The former vice president also slammed the president and Senate Republican leaders over Sunday’s impasse on a nearly $2 trillion stimulus package to help workers, small businesses and large companies devastated by the economic collapse caused by the pandemic — though Democratic leaders took heat from GOP colleagues for blocking that bill. Biden's move to essentially hold his own briefings amid the coronavirus pandemic is unusual, considering they are sure to offer a starkly different message than the daily briefings out of the White House during a time of national emergency. But they also come as the former vice president must keep a high profile, asserting himself as the presumptive nominee even as the numerous primary delays tied to the pandemic prevent him from officially locking down the nomination and beating lone remaining rival Bernie Sanders. Biden had been on a roll – zooming past Sen. Sanders in late February and early this month to take a commanding lead in the race for convention delegates. But as he swept last Tuesday’s contests in Florida, Illinois, and Arizona – cementing his status as the likely nominee and all but closing the populist senator from Vermont’s extremely narrow path to win the nomination – the nation’s focus was squarely on the coronavirus as the death toll and number of Americans infected with the COVID-19 disease surged. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK The former vice president was relegated to giving a low-quality webcast speech from his Wilmington, Del., home. Since then Biden’s mostly disappeared from the headlines while the president’s been a daily and controversial fixture at the White House briefings on the federal response to the coronavirus outbreak “Joe Biden is reduced to being on the sideline,” veteran GOP consultant and Fox News contributor Karl Rove said on ""Fox News Sunday."" “This kind of sustained nationwide lockdown is unprecedented and shows the benefit of incumbency. The president can get media attention every day. Given his erratic performance, that’s not always a good thing, but it at least keeps him in the public eye through the media in a way that no one else can,” Mo Elleithee, the founding executive director of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service and a Fox News contributor, noted. But Biden used those appearances by Trump to take aim at the president on Friday during a conference call with political reporters. “President Trump, stop saying false things, will you? People are worried. They are really frightened. And when these things don’t come true, you just exacerbate their concern. Stop saying false things [you] think make you sound like a hero,” Biden said. In a statement on Sunday, Biden charging that “President Trump’s dithering on preparing us for this global pandemic and his lies about his response to this dangerous crisis is one of the most unjustifiable failures of presidential leadership in American history.” And Biden’s campaign is going up with a new digital video on Facebook and Instagram in crucial general election battleground states that paints a stark contrast between the president’s combative tone with a reporter at a White House briefing last week and Biden’s answer to a similar question asked at a presidential primary debate eight days ago. The video ends with the words on screen: “This moment calls for a president. In November, you can elect one.” Trump’s reelection campaign is firing back, accusing Biden of trying to politicize the crisis. ""By preying upon Americans’ fear amid the coronavirus outbreak, Biden isn’t just playing cheap politics. He’s making the crisis worse. It’s dangerous,” the campaign said in an email. ""Biden's Monday morning quarterbacking is an effort to sow anger and division among Americans."" The video – and likelihood of near-daily on-camera briefings – are all signs the candidate and his campaign are reasserting themselves.  Also likely in the works: an uptick in virtual town halls and fundraisers and other forms of digital campaigning. “The fact that this is happening in the digital era means that Biden doesn’t need to rely on traditional tactics. He  can create his own opportunities to talk with voters directly, going around the media. Ads aren’t enough. He has an opportunity to draw a contrast with the president by exhibiting leadership, and addressing people’s concerns, as opposed to dismissing them,” noted Elleithee, a senior spokesman for Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign who later served as communications director for the Democratic National Committee. And he stressed that Biden “just needs to start seizing those opportunities more frequently.” Biden also acknowledged he’s getting ready to begin considering the biggest decision he’ll make as his party’s standard-bearer – choosing a running mate. “I have to start that vetting process relatively soon, meaning in a matter of weeks,"" Biden said Sunday during his virtual fundraiser. “I think there will be a group that is in excess of six or seven people that I look at.” And after a brief lull, Biden is also picking up the pace on raising campaign cash, holding near-daily virtual fundraisers. But there’s a catch — Biden’s not the nominee just yet. Although nearly mathematically eliminated, Sanders has yet to drop out of the race. And with many of the upcoming primaries postponed as most Americans huddle in their homes as they try and ride out the pandemic, Biden won’t be reaching the 1,991 convention delegates needed to clinch the nomination any time soon.

On the Senate floor shortly after noon on Monday, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell lit into Democrats, specifically alleging they were trying to extract concessions from airlines over their ""carbon footprint,"" with the economy hanging in the balance. “They ought to be embarrassed,” he said. “This is no time for this nonsense.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer countered that they were dealt an exclusively Republican-authored bill. “We Democrats are trying to get things done, not making partisan speech after partisan speech,” he said.

Pelosi said the House would introduce their own bill as she was reportedly seeking a ""laundry list"" of items to be included in the emergency legislation, including wiping out up to $10,000 in student loan debt per person and securing election-security funding. Other add-ons that Democrats including Pelosi have pushed for include food security aid, small business loans, and other measures for workers, The Associated Press reported, though these are more closely related to the crisis at hand. Democrats including Schumer, D-N.Y., also claimed to have problems with the existing draft of the bill, arguing that the plan put forth by Senate Republicans was tilted toward corporations and did too little to help workers and health care providers. Many Democrats had complained that the draft aid package did not go far enough to provide health care and unemployment aid for Americans, and failed to put restraints on a proposed $500 billion ""slush fund"" for corporations, saying the ban on corporate stock buy-backs are weak and the limits on executive pay would last only two years. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP “There were some serious problems with the bill leader McConnell laid down. Huge amounts of corporate bailout funds without restrictions or without oversight -- you wouldn’t even know who is getting the money. Not enough money for hospitals, nurses, PPE, masks, all the health care needs. No money for state and local government, many of whom would go broke. Many other things,” Schumer said. Earlier Sunday, it had seemed that the two sides were close to an agreement. While McConnell had recognized that there was still ""elbowing and maneuvering for room"" taking place, the legislation had bipartisan support including from ""a lot of rank-and-file Democrats who were involved in drafting it.""

Here are some of the worst misinformation and scams about the virus that you should keep an eye out for. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Monday praised the American people's resolve while calling on President Trump to ""start to act"" like the ""wartime president"" he says he is, in the first of what his campaign says will be regular briefings about the coronavirus threat. Biden's remarks, livestreamed from a studio set up in his home, were short compared with the president's near-daily coronavirus briefings, lasting less than 15 minutes in total. Trump's all-hands-on-deck press conferences often run over an hour. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW But the former vice president covered a range of topics including the president's coronavirus response, what he would do if he were in the Oval Office, the lessons that can be learned from governors' actions to fight the coronavirus, the Senate Republicans' stimulus proposal and a lawsuit backed by the Trump administration and Republican attorneys general to strike down ObamaCare on constitutional grounds. Biden called on Republicans to drop that lawsuit. ""It's worth noting that today is the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Affordable Care Act. I'm proud of the role I played alongside President Obama backing him up to bring Obamacare into the law,"" Biden said. ""But also today in the middle of one of the largest public health emergencies in generations, the White House and Republican attorneys general are actively pursuing a lawsuit to invalidate the ACA in court. They're working to strip millions of Americans of their health care and tens of millions of their protections for preexisting conditions."" JOE BUCK WILL CALL PLAY-BY-PLAY FOR CORONAVIRUS-ERA HOME VIDEOS: 'I'D LOVE TO GET SOME PRACTICE REPS IN' He continued: ""I sent a letter this morning with a simple request, withdraw the lawsuit please."" On the Senate Republicans' coronavirus response bill, Biden said it focused too much on corporate America and not enough on individuals struggling because of the pandemic. This, after Senate Democrats blocked the massive economic rescue package on Sunday, sending negotiators scrambling to reach a deal. ""As of last night President Trump and [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell were offering a plan to let big corporations off the hook,"" Biden said. ""They proposed a $500 billion slush fund for corporations with almost no conditions. Under their plan, the Trump administration could even allow companies to use the money ... being given to them .. to buy back stocks, increase executive pays, if that's what the secretary of the treasury decided. They wouldn't have to make commitments to keep workers employed."" Biden also had some advice for Trump on his daily briefings and his coronavirus response. ""Later today you'll hear from the president in his daily briefing. These briefings are an important opportunity to inform and reassure the American public. They're not a place for political attacks or to lash out at the press. They're about the American people,"" Biden said. ""So I hope today and in the days ahead the president will give us the unvarnished truth. That's what the American people need and what they deserve."" He also said: “Trump keeps saying he is a wartime president, well, start to act like one. … Donald Trump is not to blame for the coronavirus, but he does bear responsibility for our response.” JOE BIDEN'S CORONAVIRUS PLAN: WHAT'S IN IT? Biden's move to essentially hold his own briefings amid the coronavirus pandemic is unusual, considering they are sure to offer a starkly different message than the daily briefings out of the White House during a time of national emergency. But they also come as the former vice president must keep a high profile, asserting himself as the presumptive nominee even as the numerous primary delays tied to the pandemic prevent him from officially locking down the nomination and beating lone remaining rival Bernie Sanders. Trump’s reelection campaign is firing back, accusing Biden of trying to politicize the crisis. ""By preying upon Americans’ fear amid the coronavirus outbreak, Biden isn’t just playing cheap politics. He’s making the crisis worse. It’s dangerous,” the campaign said in an email. ""Biden's Monday morning quarterbacking is an effort to sow anger and division among Americans."" Biden on Monday also criticized Trump for not warning Americans urgently enough and acting fast enough to fight the coronavirus, citing his own comments about the coronavirus on Jan. 27. ""The mindset that was slow to recognize the problem in the first place, to treat it with the seriousness it deserved, is still too much a part of how the president is addressing the problem,"" Biden said. Biden then sounded the alarm on the need for work on treatments and vaccines for the coronavirus, employing the Defense Production Act to get masks and ventilators to health care professionals caring for those sick with the coronavirus, stepping up testing and more — mostly along the lines of recommendations he made in a detailed coronavirus response plan over a week ago.

"                          The coronavirus has undoubtedly placed large amount of stress in many local communities and the nation. For all those willing to lend a helping hand, here are some places volunteers can go to help. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced Monday that he is in self-quarantine after coming into contact with an individual who tested positive for the novel coronavirus. “After learning I had contact with someone who has COVID-19, I plan to lead by example and work from home,” Walz, a Democrat, tweeted Monday. KLOBUCHAR SAYS HUSBAND HAS CORONAVIRUS “I currently have no symptoms and will continue working tirelessly to combat the spread of COVID-19. #StayHomeMN,” Walz added. As of late Sunday, Minnesota had 169 positive cases of COVID-19.       Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is in self-quarantine out of an abundance of caution after coming into contact with an individual who tested positive for COVID-19.       Walz’s announcement comes after another government official from the state -- Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar -- shared that her husband tested positive and is currently hospitalized in Virginia with pneumonia, due to the coronavirus. She said he is on oxygen. Klobuchar explained she and her husband have been in different places for the last two weeks and that she is “outside the 14-day period for getting sick,” so she will not self-quarantine. She said her doctor advised her not to get tested for COVID-19. THESE US SENATORS ARE IN SELF QUARANTINE OVER COVID-19 THREAT Meanwhile, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said he tested positive for COVID-19, sending himself, as well as Sens. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Mitt Romney, R-Utah, into self-quarantine. GOP Sens. Cory Gardner, R-Co., and Rick Scott, R-Fla., are also in self-quarantine over interactions with different individuals who tested positive for the virus.

"                          With growing fears of the coronavirus pandemic, states have begun to respond by postponing their primary elections. Here are the states that have begun to take these initial steps. The spreading coronavirus outbreak has shut down more and more of American life — including schools, sporting events, bars, and now even elections. Multiple states have either announced they are postponing their presidential primary elections due to concerns about the novel coronavirus or made clear they are considering it. In an interview after the most recent presidential debate -- which was held in a closed-off studio rather than in a hall with a live audience -- presidential candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders hinted that it could be worth moving primary elections to protect against the coronavirus. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW TRAVELING DURING THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK: WHAT TO PACK ""I would hope that governors listen to the public health experts and what they are saying is … we don’t want gatherings of more than 50 people,” Sanders said. “I’m thinking about some of the elderly people sitting behind the desks, registering people and doing all that stuff. Does that make sense? I’m not sure it does."" Here are the states that are putting off their presidential primary elections: Louisiana Louisiana became the first state to postpone a primary or caucus on March 13, with Gov. John Bel Edwards signing an executive order to move the April 4 election to late June. ""Today I have certified that a state of emergency exists and requested that the governor issue an executive order postponing the elections this spring. We have requested postponing the April 4 primary election until June 20 and postponing the May 9 general election until July 25,"" Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin said. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES UNDER SIEGE AMID CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE: REPORT Christina Stephens, a spokeswoman for Edwards, said the move was to prevent further person-to-person transmission of the virus in Louisiana. ""We are experiencing community spread of coronavirus in Louisiana and the governor is taking decisive action to slow its progress,"" she said. Georgia Georgia also moved its elections from March 24 to May 19 on March 14 after Gov. Brian Kemp declared a state of emergency. LINDSAY GRAHAM TESTS NEGATIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS AS CONGRESS WORKS TO KEEP MEMBERS, STAFF HEALTHY ""Events are moving rapidly and my highest priority is protecting the health of our poll workers, their families, and the community at large,"" said Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Ohio Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine asked a judge on March 16 to allow his state to postpone its election, originally scheduled for Tuesday, March 17, to June 2. ""We cannot conduct this election tomorrow,” he stressed in an announcement. After the judge ruled that the election would have to go forward, DeWine announced that he would prevent polls from opening anyway, with his state health director closing down polls ""as a health emergency."" DEMOCRACY 2020 DIGEST: OHIO TO ORDER POLLS CLOSED OVER CORONAVIRUS 'EMERGENCY,' GOVERNOR SAYS DeWine said that the state's in-person voting would not conform with CDC guidelines for preventing the spread of the coronavirus, and vowed to find a way to hold a ""free and fair"" election without putting voters' health at risk. ""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,"" DeWine said in a statement. ""As such, Health Director Dr. Amy Acton will order the polls closed as a health emergency. While the polls will be closed tomorrow, Secretary of State Frank LaRose will seek a remedy through the courts to extend voting options so that every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity."" The Ohio Supreme Court, in a ruling without an opinion Tuesday morning, denied a last-second effort to force the state to move ahead with the Tuesday elections, giving further legitimacy to DeWine's 11th-hour maneuver. Officials in the other three states that had elections scheduled for March 17 -- Arizona, Florida and Illinois -- still went forward with their plans. Kentucky On recommendation from Kentucky Secretary of State Michael G. Adams, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear pushed back that state's primary from May 19 to June 23. ""I never would have imagined sitting here discussing this with you, but these are unprecedented times,"" Adams said in a video posted to Twitter. ""And we Kentuckians are having to change the way we do things on all fronts. Kentucky law allows the secretary of state and the governor to jointly act to change the time of an election due to a state of emergency."" He continued: ""Postponing the primary was not an easy decision, but the Republican secretary of state and Democratic governor agree, and so do county clerks of both parties, and they are our frontline election administrators. My hope is that this delay will allow us to have a normal election. Even if not, this delay will allow me, the state board of elections and our county clerks time to assess what changes we must make to ensure a successful primary election. There could be more changes, but this was a first step to buy is time and keep our citizens as safe as possible. We'll get through this."" Kentucky was originally slated to have one of the latest primaries of any state, with only five states and Washington, D.C., voting after it. This move by Kentucky throws into question almost the entire 2020 primary calendar, especially after President Trump's comments that the coronavirus pandemic could last until July or August in the United States. Maryland Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced in a March 17 press conference that he is postponing Maryland's April 28 primary election to June 2, making Maryland the sixth state or territory to put off its presidential primaries amid coronavirus fears. ""I have two main priorities: keeping Marylanders safe and protecting their constitutional right to vote,"" Hogan said. ""Yesterday we announced that gatherings of more than 50 people are prohibited statewide, and it would endanger public health to allow thousands of people to assemble in places like schools and senior centers which are already closed under the state of emergency."" Hogan also mentioned the 7th Congressional District seat which was vacated by the death of Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md. Hogan said he has instructed the state board of elections to hold the April 28 special election -- in what is a heavily blue district -- by mail. Democratic nominee Kweisi Mfume, who held the 7th Congressional District seat before Cummings, is widely expected to win that election, retaking a seat he held in the 1990's. Hogan said it is important that Maryland have a representative from the 7th District, which is centered around Baltimore, in Congress. Connecticut Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont announced March 19 that his state would move its primary, previously scheduled for April 28, to June 2. ""My most important concerns are allowing every Connecticut voter to make their voice heard in the selection of the presidential candidates, and ensuring that they are able to cast their ballots as safely as possible,"" Connecticut Secretary of State Denise Merrill said in a statement on the election change. She said that moving the primary was ""a recognition of the severity and the nature of this crisis and, along with my request to temporarily remove restrictive absentee ballot language from the statute, will allow the maximum number of Connecticut voters to participate in the electoral process, even if they wish to avoid gathering in a polling place."" Maryland was also scheduled for April 28 and moved its primary to June 2. Indiana Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb announced March 20 that it would move its presidential primary, which was scheduled for May 5, to June 2, falling in line with a number of other states hoping the coronavirus threat will at least partially subside by that date. ""This wasn't a step taken lightly -- and it's all centered around making sure Hoosiers can still exercise their right to vote during this coronavirus pandemic,"" a statement from the Indiana Republican State Committee said. ""It was a joint decision made by Governor Holcomb, Secretary of State Connie Lawson, Indiana Republican Party Chairman Kyle Hupfer and the Indiana Democrats."" Indiana officials recommended to the state election commission that all Indiana voters be able to use mail-in ballots to reduce the risk of coronavirus spread at polls. Indiana was the seventh state do delay its Democratic presidential primary and the eighth major jurisdiction to do so, counting Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico Though it is not a state, Puerto Rico holds primaries for both parties. The Puerto Rico Republican primary already took place on March 8, but the Puerto Rico Democratic Party requested that the government delay its Democratic primary, which was scheduled for March 29. ""This is an unpredictable day-by-day situation that requires constant monitoring of the progress of the disease. Our intention is to keep all options open to ensure the citizen's right to vote,"" party Chairman Charles Rodriguez said in a statement. The Spanish-language news site El Nuevo Dia reported that on March 16 the Puerto Rico Senate approved a resolution that postpones the territory's Democratic primary to April 26 and gives the president of its elections commission the power to move the primary even further if he decides it is still not safe to hold an election. Mississippi Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves postponed the state's 2nd Congressional District's Republican runoff election between Thomas Carey and Brian Flowers. They are fighting to take on incumbent Democrat Bennie Thompson in November. The runoff was originally scheduled for March 31, and will now take place on June 23. ""We face an unprecedented health crisis. Conducting an election during this outbreak would force poll workers and voters to place themselves in unnecessary risk,"" Reeves said in a statement. Alabama CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Alabama held its presidential primary elections on Super Tuesday, so it was able to have its say on the presidential nominees before the coronavirus became a full-blown crisis. But Gov. Kay Ivey was forced to delay the state's March 31 primary runoff elections to July 14. That runoff includes the battle for the Republican U.S. Senate nomination between former Trump Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Trump-endorsed former Auburn University head football coach Tommy Tuberville.

Here’s who is in quarantine Several GOP senators have been forced into self-quarantine after either contracting the novel coronavirus, or interacting with individuals who have tested positive. Here is a list of Republican senators who are currently in, or have been in self-quarantine amid the COVID-19 outbreak: Sen. Rand Paul Sen. Rand Paul tested positive for coronavirus on Sunday and is under self-quarantine at his home in Kentucky. “Senator Rand Paul has tested positive for COVID-19. He is feeling fine and is in quarantine,” Paul's staff tweeted Sunday afternoon. “He is asymptomatic and was tested out of an abundance of caution due to his extensive travel and events. He was not aware of any direct contact with any infected person.” ""He expects to be back in the Senate after his quarantine period ends and will continue to work for the people of Kentucky at this difficult time,"" a second tweet said. ""Ten days ago, our D.C. office began operating remotely, hence virtually no staff has had contact with Senator Rand Paul.” His team later tweeted: ""We want to be clear, Senator Paul left the Senate IMMEDIATELY upon learning of his diagnosis. He had zero contact with anyone & went into quarantine. Insinuations such as those below that he went to the gym after learning of his results are just completely false & irresponsible!"" Sen. Mitt Romney Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, had lunch with Paul over the weekend amid negotiations over the stimulus package.       Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, pauses to speak to media as he arrives for a briefing on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, March, 12, 2020, on the coronavirus outbreak. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)       Romney said that his physician had instructed him to “immediately self-quarantine and not to vote on the Senate floor, after recently having lunch with Paul. Sen. Mike Lee Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said he would self-quarantine late Sunday, after apparently interacting with Paul, but emphasized he would work as much as possible remotely. ""Upon learning that my colleague Sen. Paul tested positive for COVID-19, I consulted the attending physician of the U.S. Congress,” Lee said Sunday. “He advised me that because I have no symptoms or other risk factors, a COVID-19 test was not warranted. However, given the timing, proximity, and duration of my exposure to Sen. Paul, he directed me to self-quarantine for 14 days.”       Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, is in self-quarantine after interacting with Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.      (AP) Lee added: “That means no traveling or voting. But, I will continue to make sure Utah's voice is heard as we shape the federal response to the coronavirus through phone, text, email and whatever other means are available.” Sen. Cory Gardner Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., is in self-quarantine, which he announced March 17. Gardner had contact with a constituent who later tested positive for coronavirus. “While I am not showing any symptoms at this time, I have made the decision to self-quarantine out of an abundance of caution with an effective date of March 11th at the recommendation of the Tri-County Health Department,” Gardner said in a statement last week. Sen. Rick Scott Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., is also in self-quarantine, after having interacted with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who is being monitored for coronavirus. Scott has said he was feeling fine after interacting with Bolsonaro but was self-quarantining out of an abundance of caution. “I’m doing this out of precaution,” Scott told Fox News’ Neil Cavuto. “I want to make sure that I don’t have an adverse impact on anybody else. So, my doctors have told me that I have a low risk, that I don’t need a test since I don’t have any symptoms.” Sen. Lindsey Graham Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., was in self-quarantine after attending an event at Mar-a-Lago earlier this month with Bolsonaro and a member of the Brazilian president’s delegation who later tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Graham was tested for COVID-19, and revealed last week that his test was negative, after having been in self-quarantine. ""I was just informed by [Dr. Monahan], the head of the House Physicians Office, that my coronavirus test was NEGATIVE. I am very grateful and like everyone else will follow the best practices to stay negative,"" Graham tweeted. ""I look forward to getting back to work with my Senate colleagues and President Trump to contain this virus and stabilize our economy. Thank you very much for all the prayers and well wishes!” Sen. Ted Cruz Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, was in self-quarantine earlier this month after having attended the Conservative Political Action Conference outside of Washington, D.C., after an attendee later tested positive.

A GOP-backed stimulus bill failed to clear a procedural hurdle Sunday night after Democrats complained that the draft aid package did not go far enough to provide health care and unemployment aid for Americans. Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell teed the bill up for another vote on the matter Monday afternoon. First to speak during an hour of debate for that vote was Collins, who also took at aim at Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. ""Here we are facing an enemy that is invisible but ... devastating to the health of our people and to the health of our economy,"" Collins said. ""And yet unbelievably the Democratic leader objected to my even being able to speak this morning. Is this what we've come to? The Democratic leader objected to our convening at 9 a.m. this morning so that we could begin working in ... earnest."" CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW Collins' comments come amid a pandemic that has cut the stock market's value by about 30 percent over the course of weeks and threatens to overwhelm the American health care system. ""We don't have another day. We don't have another hour. We don't have another minute to delay acting,"" Collins said. ""How can any of us want to see millions of Americans lose their paychecks, their health insurance, their contributions to their retirement plans? We have a package that's part of this broader legislation."" REPUBLICANS SAY DEMS BLOCKING CORONAVIRUS RELIEF OVER 'IDEOLOGICAL WISH LIST' Collins is known as one of the most moderate Republicans in the Senate and as an institutionalist. But she is also known for giving passionate speeches from the Senate floor, including one oration explaining her vote on the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh that marked the point at which his confirmation became a near certainty. The veteran senator acknowledged on Monday that it is unlikely that every member of the body would agree on the details of a package, but emphasized the necessity to ""get the job done for the American people."" Collins' comments come after Senate Republicans ushered through a $100 billion second-stage coronavirus bill passed by the House without any amendments last week. It also came minutes after Schumer and McConnell had just finished ripping into each other over their disagreements on the coronavirus bill and seconds before an argument between McConnell and Sen. Joe Manchin D-W.Va. on the Senate floor over the upcoming vote. IN BRIEF CORONAVIRUS 'BRIEFING,' BIDEN CALLS FOR UNITY AND TAKES AIM AT TRUMP The tension led Sen.

"                          Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer joins John Roberts on 'Fox News Sunday.' Michigan on Monday became the latest state to issue a stay-at-home order to its residents, joining a growing list of places on lockdown across the country as lawmakers try to thwart the spread of the coronavirus. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced the ""Stay Home, Stay Safe"" executive order, which goes into effect on Tuesday and will be in place until at least April 13. The order requires all Michigan businesses to suspend in-person operations unless they are part of the ""critical infrastructure workforce"" or those needed for ""minimal basic operations."" Schools will also remain closed until April 13. Residents of the state are also being asked to stay at home, but people can go outside to care for family members, perform necessary government activities, obtain necessary supplies like groceries or medications, and to exercise. HOW TO PREVENT THE SPREAD ""When we look back at this, we’ve got to be able to say we did everything we could,"" Whitmer said during a press conference. She added: ""Don’t play fast and loose with what is essential and what is not…Don’t try to skirt the rules."" Michigan joins a growing list of states that have issued orders restricting movement of residents in an effort to slow the spread of the contagion. Current restrictions are in place in the country’s three largest cities – New York, Los Angeles and Chicago – and affect more than 70 million people across the country. Whitmer decided to issue the executive order after the state saw a drastic rise in COVID-19 infections over the last 13 days. The state went from zero cases to 1232 confirmed cases in that time period, with the number of those infected doubling over the weekend. Whitmer added that Michigan needs help from the federal government to keep health care workers protected as they battle the outbreak, saying that the allotment of personal protective equipment they’ve received “was barely enough to cover 1 shift at 1 hospital.” “Our ability to safely lift this order will depend on factors like data on COVID-19 infections and the disease's rate of spread, depend on whether sufficient medical personnel, hospital beds and equipment exists to meet anticipated medical needs and the state's capacity to test for COVID-19 cases and isolate infected people,” Whitmer said. The risk to doctors, nurses and others on the front lines has become plain: Italy – which has been the hardest hit European country -- has seen at least 18 doctors with coronavirus die. Spain reported that more than 3,900 health care workers have become infected, accounting for roughly 12 percent of the country's total cases. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Health care workers say they are being asked to reuse and ration disposable masks and gloves. A shortage of ventilators, crucial for treating serious COVID-19 cases, has also become critical, as has a lack of test kits to comply with the World Health Organization's exhortations to test as many people as possible. Both President Trump and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government's top infectious-disease expert, have promised that medical supplies are about to start pouring in and will be “clearly directed to those hot spots that need it most.” New York, California and Washington are the states the federal government have identified as hot spots of the outbreak. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever or coughing. But for some older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. Over 100,000 people have recovered, mostly in China.

"                          Republican Kentucky senator Rand Paul tests positive for COVID-19 and will remain in quarantine, according to his official Twitter account. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was on the receiving end of withering criticism from Senate colleagues after it appeared he was still tending to his typical business at the U.S. Capitol after being tested for the coronavirus — his results came back positive Sunday. Leading the charge was Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., who tweeted Sunday in reaction to a report from The New York Times that Paul was at the Senate gym that same morning, apparently just hours before he learned he had tested positive for coronavirus. ""I’ve never commented about a fellow Senator’s choices/actions. Never once,"" she said. ""This, America, is absolutely irresponsible. You cannot be near other people while waiting for coronavirus test results. It endangers others & likely increases the spread of the virus."" CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW DEMOCRATS SCORN TRUMP CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE AS SENATE REACHES IMPASSE ON THIRD AID BILL But in an extensive statement Monday afternoon, Paul defended his handling of the situation, saying he got tested simply because he and his wife had traveled extensively in recent weeks and he's at higher risk due to having part of his lung removed following an assault. ""I felt that it was highly unlikely that I was positive since I have had no symptoms of the illness, nor have I had contact with anyone who has either tested positive for the virus or been sick,"" he said. Paul said he remains ""asymptomatic"" and said to his critics: “For those who want to criticize me for lack of quarantine, realize that if the rules on testing had been followed to a tee, I would never have been tested and would still be walking around the halls of the Capitol. The current guidelines would not have called for me to get tested nor quarantined.  It was my extra precaution, out of concern for my damaged lung, that led me to get tested. ""Perhaps it is too much to ask that we simply have compassion for our fellow Americans who are sick or fearful of becoming so. ... The broader the testing and the less finger-pointing we have, the better."" Sinema sounded off as it became clear lawmakers on both sides of the aisle were angry with not just Paul for sticking around while awaiting the test results but with the decision for Senate Republicans to be consistently meeting in person over the past weeks as Democrats largely took care of their business via conference call. ""We need to talk with the Attending Physician,"" one senior GOP source said, referring to Dr. Brian Monahan, the Attending Physician for the Capitol. ""And, Rand Paul."" Paul's office had earlier defended his actions Sunday as largely precautionary, implying the positive coronavirus diagnosis was a surprise. ""Similar to the President and the Vice President, Senator Rand Paul decided to get tested after attending an event where two individuals subsequently tested positive for COVID-19, even though he wasn't aware of any direct contact with either one of them,"" a statement from Paul Deputy Chief of Staff Sergio Gor said. ""Additionally, due to a prior lung injury, and subsequent surgery on his lung, Senator Paul is in a higher risk category as it relates to pulmonary issues."" SEN. RAND PAUL TESTS POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS A tweet from Paul's Twitter account further defended the Kentucky senator. ""We want to be clear, Senator Paul left the Senate IMMEDIATELY upon learning of his diagnosis,"" it said. ""He had zero contact with anyone & went into quarantine. Insinuations such as those below that he went to the gym after learning of his results are just completely false & irresponsible!"" But the criticism of the senator largely focused on his call not to self-quarantine while awaiting the test result. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Paul did have one high profile supporter amid the chorus of criticism he faced Sunday -- President Trump. ""My friend (always there when I’ve needed him!), Senator @RandPaul, was just tested 'positive' from the Chinese Virus. That is not good! He is strong and will get better. Just spoke to him and he was in good spirits,"" Trump said. Paul's office has said that he is in quarantine in Kentucky while continuing to work and that he has not shown any symptoms from the coronavirus. It also said that his D.C. staff had been working remotely for the past 10 days. Paul is one of five Senate Republicans in quarantine right now — meaning Republicans only hold a 48-47 Senate majority among those capable of voting in person as lawmakers try to hash out a coronavirus stimulus package.

"                          Chad Pergram reports tensions have exploded on the Senate floor as lawmakers try to reach a deal on a coronavirus aid package Tensions flared on the Senate floor Monday as lawmakers viscerally clashed on camera over phase three of a coronavirus response package, with Democrats blocking Republican efforts to advance the massive stimulus bill for the second day in a row. Leaving the legislation in limbo once more, the Senate stalled over the package Monday afternoon on a 49-46 vote. It needed 60 votes to advance. REPUBLICANS SAY DEMOCRATS BLOCKING CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL OVER 'IDEOLOGICAL WISHLIST' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., then stormed to the floor to accuse Democrats of ""mindless obstruction"" that could drag out any action for days. He said Democrats' list of demands keeps getting ""longer and longer."" Democrats argue the more-than $1 trillion package did too much for large corporations and not enough for workers, but Republicans accuse them of playing politics and using the crisis as leverage to try and jam through unrelated political ""wish list"" items concerning climate change and more. “The country is burning, and your side wants to play political games,” Senate Majority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., said shortly before the vote. “It is time to get this done. The American people expect us to act, they need action. We need to get this done for the American people.” Thune slammed Democrats—specifically moderate Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., who just moments earlier said the bill was “weighted toward the Wall Street corporation side.” “Here we are dilly-dallying around,” Thune said. “This bill is about workers, families, people out there hurting economically—we’re in a position to do something about it and it is high time that we did.” Emotions ran so high on the floor before the vote that at one point Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., implored colleagues to take a breath and focus on the work. “We’re going to get this done today,” Durbin said. “Everyone take a breath. Everyone is emotional today, but we’re going to get this done. We have a job to do.” The package first failed Sunday in the face of Democratic opposition. McConnell then called Monday for the re-do on the procedural vote to begin debate—to which Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., agreed. That vote failed, again, shortly afterward. “Republicans understand that a national crisis calls for urgency and calls for bipartisanship,” McConnell said earlier. “It’s time for Democrats to stop playing politics and step up to the plate. “We’re at war with no ammo,” he continued. “Democrats are talking about this as if it is some juicy political opportunity. This is not a juicy political opportunity.” “This has got to stop and today’s the day it has to stop,” McConnell said. “The country is out of time.” Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, blasted Democrats as “disgraceful” for delaying further work on the legislation. Schumer countered that Democrats are only “looking for oversight. If this federal government is making a big loan to someone, to a big company, we ought to know it and know the details immediately. The bill that was put on the floor by the Republican leader said no one would know a thing about those loans for six months, at least.” The latest procedural vote failure leaves unclear whether ongoing negotiations will yield a workable compromise. Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Monday, after returning to Washington, D.C., from recess, said House Democrats would roll out their own bill, again accusing Senate Republicans of putting corporations first in their proposed legislation. THESE US SENATORS ARE IN SELF-QUARANTINE AMID COVID-19 THREAT “The Senate Republicans’ bill, as presented, put corporations first, not workers and families,” Pelosi said in a statement Monday. “Today, House Democrats will unveil a bill that takes responsibility for the health, wages and well-being of America’s workers: the Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act.” Many Democrats had complained that the draft aid package did not go far enough to provide health care and unemployment aid for Americans, and failed to put restraints on a proposed $500 billion ""slush fund"" for corporations, saying the ban on corporate stock buy-backs are weak and the limits on executive pay would last only two years. Officials put the price tag of the rescue package at nearly $1.4 trillion and said that with other measures from the Federal Reserve it could pump $2 trillion into the U.S. economy. The draft legislation would provide payments of up to $1,200 per person. They would be phased down at adjusted gross income thresholds of $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 per couple. Additionally, there would be $500 payments for each child. The amount is reduced to zero for single taxpayers with incomes exceeding $99,000 and $198,000 for joint filers. Central to the package is as much as $350 billion for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home, and billions in loans to airlines and other industries. Senate Republicans, like McConnell and Thune, slammed Pelosi on Monday, claiming that she returned from recess and sabotaged all bipartisan efforts in the upper chamber. “There was great bipartisan cooperation and then yesterday, the Speaker of the House showed up with an agenda,” Thune said. “And all of a sudden, it got taken over at the leadership level…and instead of helping American workers, we’re talking about the Green New Deal.” But Durbin defended Pelosi, saying that it is clear that “she really does unnerve people on the other side.” Durbin added that her intervention in negotiations “happens to be consistent with the bicameral system of government that we have.” And Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said the original bill was not bipartisan, and that Democrats were not included in initial negotiations. Meanwhile, Schumer, who said he was “hopeful” the Senate would get something done Monday, left the Senate floor to continue negotiations with the White House and Senate Republicans. “We’re going to get this done today,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday. “Everybody is working very hard so we look forward to a big vote today.” When asked when he expected to have a final agreement with both Senate Republicans and Democrats, Mnuchin said: “As fast as we can.” But McConnell is likely to face a challenge in crossing the 60-vote hurdle of the procedural vote, as five key GOP senators are in self-quarantine. On Sunday, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., announced he had tested positive for COVID-19, sending Sens. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Mitt Romney, R-Utah, into self-quarantine after interacting with Paul throughout the weekend. Paul, Lee, and Romney joined Sens. Rick Scott, R-Fla., and Cory Gardner, R-Co., in self-quarantine. Scott, out of an abundance of caution, put himself in quarantine after meeting with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. A member of Bolsonaro’s staff tested positive for the virus. Gardner went into self-quarantine on March 17 after interacting with a constituent who, also, later tested positive. Under normal circumstances, the Senate breakdown is 53 Republicans and 47 senators who caucus with the Democrats. But with five Republican senators quarantined, the GOP barely has a majority in the upper chamber, at 48 Republican senators to 47 Democratic senators.

"                                    Former Vice President Joe Biden addressed a letter to the Trump administration on Monday asking them to drop a lawsuit threatening Obamacare.            Former Vice President Joe Biden is calling on President Trump to drop a legal challenge to the Affordable Care Act amid the growing coronavirus pandemic. In a letter addressed on Monday morning to Trump, Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves and 18 attorneys general, Biden wrote, “At a time of national emergency, which is laying bare the existing vulnerabilities in our public health infrastructure, it is unconscionable that you are continuing to pursue a lawsuit designed to strip millions of Americans of their health insurance and protections under the Affordable Care Act., including the ban on insurers denying coverage or raising premiums due to pre-existing conditions.” IN BRIEF CORONAVIRUS BRIEFING, BIDEN CALLS FOR UNITY AND TAKES AIM AT TRUMP  The letter was sent exactly 10 years after former President Obama signed the ACA into law. Earlier this month, the U.S. Supreme Court announced it would review a challenge to the ACA’s constitutionality after a group of states led by Texas claimed there was no longer a legal justification for it. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The law was first upheld by the Supreme Court under the justification that the financial penalty tied to the individual mandate, the requirement to buy health insurance, fell under Congress’ taxation power. But when Trump eliminated the penalty, Republican-led states claimed there was no longer a legal basis for the mandate. In December, a federal appeals court panel found the law unconstitutional. “The litigation you are supporting––Texas v. U.S.–– threatens the peace of mind and access to care for hundreds of millions of Americans…The only reason this new case gained traction was because Congressional Republicans decided to amend the law and zero-out the penalty for not being insured, and legal experts from across the ideological spectrum have concluded that this new argument––that this change invalidates the entire law––is legally unsupportable,” Biden argued in the letter. SUPREME COURT AGREES TO REVIEW OBAMACARE CHALLENGE OVER FUNDING MECHANISM       Earlier this month, the U.S. Supreme Court announced it would review a challenge to the ACA’s constitutionality after a group of states led by Texas claimed there was no longer a legal justification for it.         At a town hall hosted by Fox News in Scranton, Penn., earlier this month, Trump was asked how he plans to rally Republicans around a health care plan after failing to come up with an alternative to ObamaCare. “I think it’s probably the thing that I’m most disappointed that I haven’t been able to say 'what a good job we’ve done.' I haven’t been able to sell what a great job we’ve done. First of all, I got rid of the individual mandate, which was the worst part of ObamaCare,” Trump responded. The Supreme Court is unlikely to make a decision on the case until after the 2020 election. In the meantime, the number of coronavirus cases in the country continues to rise, with about 500 deaths on Monday. BARTIROMO: MARKETS GETTING NERVOUS WITH NO 'END DATE' IN SIGHT FOR CORONAVIRUS SHUTDOWNS During a virtual presentation from his home in Wilmington, Delaware Monday, Biden addressed the pandemic, saying, “This is not the moment to add additional uncertainty and fear in this nation or to let politics Trump doing what's right.

"                          Billionaire candidate ends campaign; reaction from former California Republican Party chairman Tom Del Beccaro. A former Bloomberg campaign staffer filed a proposed class-action lawsuit claiming that the former New York City mayor reneged on promises to pay employees through November 2020 whether or not he won the Democratic presidential nomination. Donna Wood, who worked as a field organizer for the campaign, noted that many employees left their previous jobs in order to work on the campaign with the understanding that they would continue to be paid until November's election and receive full health care benefits for themselves and their families. Nevertheless, she claimed, the campaign ""terminated the vast majority"" of workers in her position and others, leaving a number of them without insurance as coronavirus spreads across the country. MIKE BLOOMBERG SPENT NEARLY $1B OF HIS OWN MONEY ON FAILED PRESIDENTIAL BID Wood said that she and thousands of others were fired after Bloomberg dropped out of the race on March 4 following a disappointing result in the Super Tuesday primaries. ""Defendant's termination of [field organizers] and other campaign employees deprived them of promised income and health care benefits, leaving them and their families potentially uninsured in the face of a global pandemic,"" said Wood's complaint, filed Monday in Manhattan federal court. “People are going from a pretty generous health care benefit to projected 20 to 30 percent unemployment,"" Wood's attorney Sally J. Abrahamson said in a statement to Fox News. Wood also alleges that the campaign improperly classified field organizers as exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act's overtime provisions so it would not have to pay them as they ""regularly"" worked more than 40 hours a week. The FLSA has a number of exemptions from the overtime requirement, but Wood claims her primary duties of calling prospective voters to promote Bloomberg's campaign and recruiting campaign volunteers did not fall under any of those exemptions, as they had nothing to do with the management of the campaign. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN Bloomberg's strategy as a late-comer to the campaign was to skip early contests in states including Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, focusing instead on delegate-rich states that were up for grabs in the March 3 races in California, Texas, Virginia and others. Wood claims that Bloomberg promised to employ people through November due to his late entry into the race because he was trying to attract workers. Abrahamson told Fox News that Wood was terminated on March 20, the same day the campaign announced an $18 million donation to the Democratic National Committee. A Bloomberg campaign spokesperson told Fox News in a statement that the campaign paid workers ""wages and benefits that were much more generous than any other campaign this year,"" as well as ""several weeks of severance and health care through March, something no other campaign did this year. "" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The statement went on to say that health benefits will be extended due to coronavirus. ""Given the current crisis, a fund is being created to ensure that all staff receive health care through April, which no other campaign has done,"" the statement said.

"                          Many people are facing major economic strains as a result of job loss, growing medical bills or any other number of reasons as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. With initiatives being made to lessen the economic burden, here are a number of resources that people can turn to during these uncertain times. The Senate is trying to negotiate a deal for a nearly $2 trillion stimulus package to provide health care and economic aid amid the coronavirus outbreak and national shutdown of American daily life. Here’s a look at the highlights of what's expected in to be in the package, though the details could change as negotiations remain ongoing. Checks and Unemployment The package would provide direct financial help to Americans in the form of stimulus checks sent out to many Americans. The proposal would include a one-time payment of $1,200 per adult, $2,400 per couple in the U.S. and up to $3,000 for a family of four. Republicans have called for minimum payments of $600 to Americans, and aid would be phased down at income thresholds of $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 per couple. Additionally, there would be $500 payments for each child. It would establish new and much more generous unemployment benefits by adding $600 per week to normal state benefits for up to four months and provides an additional 13 weeks of benefits to 39 weeks of regular unemployment insurance through the end of 2020 if they are sidelined by the outbreak. The coverage would be retroactive to Jan. 27 and coverage would be extended to ""gig"" workers and independent contractors. SENATE DEMS PROPOSE ADDITIONAL $200 IN MONTHLY SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS, AMID CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK Small Business Support         An estimated $350 billion would be provided for small businesses to keep making payroll. Companies with 500 or fewer employees could tap up to $10 million each in forgivable small business loans to keep paychecks flowing. The program would provide 8 weeks of assistance through federally guaranteed loans qualifying employers who maintain payroll; if they do, other costs like mortgage interest, rent, and utilities would be forgiven. Funding for Public Health The bill includes an additional $242 billion in additional emergency appropriations to fight the virus and shore up for safety net programs. That includes money for food stamps, child nutrition, hospitals, the Centers for Disease Control and public health and transportation agencies. The figure has gone significantly higher during talks over the weekend. The measure includes $15.6 billion to augment the food stamp program, which helps feed around 40 million low-income people per year. Its annual budget is around $70 billion. A bipartisan package is likely to provide far more. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Big Company Loans Arguably the most controversial aspect of the proposal, the initial GOP plan called for $208 billion in loans to larger businesses like airlines, which would have to be repaid, and a subsequent; a version released over the weekend called for $500 billion. Leaders are still negotiating the final number and how the money would be provided by the administration and safeguards to prevent abuses. It delays payroll tax payments by employers, which would be able to defer payment of their 2020 payroll taxes until 2021 and 2022. With the specter of the 2008 government bailouts still looming, Democrats say the deal provides too much support for big companies with little oversight and not enough for working Americans. House Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., also wants new collective bargaining powers for unions, higher fuel emissions standards for airlines, and expanded wind and solar tax credits. Many Democrats had complained that the draft aid package did not go far enough to provide health care and unemployment aid for Americans, and failed to put restraints on a proposed $500 billion ""slush fund"" for corporations, saying the ban on corporate stock buy-backs are weak and the limits on executive pay would last only two years. Republicans are accusing Democrats of using the coronavirus pandemic as an opportunity to push unrelated political agendas, with McConnell accusing Democrats of trying to extract concessions from airlines over their ""carbon footprint,"" with the economy hanging in the balance. “They ought to be embarrassed,” he said. “This is no time for this nonsense.” Schumer countered that they were dealt an exclusively Republican-authored bill. “We Democrats are trying to get things done, not making partisan speech after partisan speech,” he said.

Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden was mocked on Monday after the gaffe-prone 2020 Democratic front-runner appeared to lose his train of thought when his teleprompter malfunctioned during remarks on the coronavirus pandemic. Biden's remarks, livestreamed from a studio set up in his home, began with his touching his face despite ongoing warnings not to do that during the coronavirus pandemic. His remarks were also short compared with the president's near-daily coronavirus briefings, lasting less than 15 minutes in total, and featured a clear teleprompter issue that became a social media punchline.

Biden signaled to his staff that there was something wrong, before going off on an awkward ad-lib. ""And, in addition to that, in addition to that we have to make sure that we, we are in a position that we are, well met me go the second thing, I've spoken enough on that,"" Biden said before going on to speak about the aggressive action he would like Trump to take under the Defense Production Act. “Joe Biden when the teleprompter stops working is a train wreck,” social media strategist Caleb Hull wrote. Biden -- who had been oddly silent during the pandemic until Monday -- covered a range of topics including what he would do if he were in the Oval Office and the lessons that can be learned from governors' actions to fight the coronavirus – but some viewers harped on the blunders. “What a disaster,” GOP spokesperson Elizabeth Harrington wrote. “Biden has had plenty of time to think about this, and he can't even figure out what to say without help from a teleprompter.” JOE BIDEN'S CORONAVIRUS PLAN: WHAT'S IN IT?

In those places, there’s every reason to believe that economic activity will be back to normal or near normal in a matter of weeks.That would mean in an American context emerging from the coronacloud by this summer, with an economic rebound teed up for the peak of the fall campaign season. Trump will be defeated or returned to office depending on how well he navigates this crisis, and that would be his best-case scenario.But the way those authoritarian cultures are achieving their goals depends on some very draconian measures. In South Korea, privacy has been obliterated as citizens’ smartphones become lojacks for health officials and devices for publicly shaming violators. In China, drones patrol the streets of affected areas, descending on those violating shelter-in-place rules. In Taiwan, the government took charge of media coverage and requires hourly public health instructions to be broadcast.None of that is going to happen in the United States, but public health officials here are looking for the closest approximations they can muster. The thinking is: Hit it hard now and avoid both a dangerous surge at hospitals and sustained economic damage.Much discussed in this vein is a Friday NYT op-ed from Dr. David Katz, a popular media voice on nutrition and obesity. His argument goes like this: We missed our chance to be proactive when nations like Singapore did, but as we finally do get widespread testing and treatment protocols on line, we can learn from their methods and move rapidly toward a more targeted approach based on protecting the most vulnerable and isolating sick people.With the public now well-aware of the dangers, we can start resuming normal activities much sooner than the worst-case scenarios that many in Europe are now enduring. If employers, organizations and individuals follow the rules and governments take a firm hand on quarantines, a pretty rapid turnaround might be possible.But we’re not there yet. Not only do we not yet have the capacity for the widespread testing required or the masks and sanitizing agents needed, it would require unifying government response at the federal, state and local level. A new “surgical” approach doesn’t work if some of the largest states aren’t on board. Turning that ship would require time and a new spirit of cooperation.NYT columnist Tom Friedman interviewed Katz and asked him how he would navigate that pivot. Katz’s answer was “a two-week isolation strategy.” Not the one we’re in, but another fortnight, this time with uniform enforcement. Katz says this “reboot” would be more palatable because there would be light at the end of the tunnel knowing that a few weeks from now, things will start to get back to normal. That, however, ignores the political realities playing out in Washington and across the country.Trump had last week already given back his 5-point post-impeachment bump in his Gallup job-approval rating. Even given the dearth of reliable polling in the time of quarantine, there’s no reason to think that there’s been any softening of his floor. Trump seems for now to be back where he has spent most of his presidency: Hovering around 40 percent.He’s essentially back where he was, which is to say on the low side but with the astonishingly durable support of the Republican base.And what the Republican base these days is not feeling is three weeks of government-ordered lockdown and cessation of normal business activities.Like Sen. Rand Paul, who now finds himself infected, many conservatives, even doctors, were already not inclined to follow government suggestions about where to go, with whom to have lunch, etc.The churches that held services this Sunday in defiance of health officials’ orders will be joined by others this week. Across rural and small-town America, especially with older citizens – Red America – resistance will increase.And it’s not just about orneriness. For many small business owners – again, heavily skewing Republican – three weeks of a shutdown would be an economic death sentence. Without the deep pockets and bailouts from which big companies benefit, they are facing an extinction-level event. They may prefer to face authorities than bankruptcy. Trump obviously senses the growing backlash on the right. His Sunday night tweet, “WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF. AT THE END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD, WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO!”Trump can’t win re-election with the economy a wreck and the virus uncontrolled. But neither can he win without his base, a group far more inclined to take chances on the pandemic than the overwhelmingly Democratic residents of major cities and the swing voters of the suburbs who are most at risk.To get where he wants to go Trump would need the cooperation of red states and blue states to really bite the bullet now and to do so at the cost of prolonged social and economic disruption.Right now, he looks like he’s stuck between the two.THE RULEBOOK: RETWEET“The prudent inquiry, in all cases, ought surely to be, not so much FROM WHOM the advice comes, as whether the advice be GOOD.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 40TIME OUT: WHERE EVERYBODY KNOWS YOUR NAME The Atlantic’s Sophie Gilbert discusses the psychology behind comfort TV: “Comfort TV, at this point, is such a well-worn idea that it’s spawned countless lists over the past few weeks, all guiding viewers toward low-investment, high-reward shows such as Schitt’s Creek, Parks and Recreation, and Bones. … This isn’t as strange as it might seem: People cope with trauma and anxiety in very different ways, which makes the shows they turn to for comfort equally incongruous and dependent on the emotional response they’re hoping to provoke. … For Elizabeth Cohen, an associate professor specializing in media psychology at [West Virginia University], her favorite rewatch is Black Mirror, while her husband prefers to relax with episodes of The Great British Baking Show. … The most obvious balm for troubled souls is television where nothing bad really happens and everything will almost certainly be okay… A different kind of comfort comes from watching reruns of shows that you’ve already seen over and over: The Office, Friends, Cheers. It’s ‘definitely nostalgia,’ Cohen said—watching to try to return, momentarily, to a different time, or a moment when everything seemed easier.”Flag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARDESTIMATED DELEGATES FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATIONBiden: 1,215Sanders: 909[Ed. note: 1,991 delegates needed to win]TRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE Average approval: 43.8 percentAverage disapproval: 51.8 percentNet Score: -8 percentChange from one week ago: ↑ 0.6 points[Average includes: NPR/PBS News/Marist: 43% approve - 50% disapprove; NBC News/WSJ: 46% approve - 51% disapprove; Gallup: 44% approve - 52% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 41% approve - 54% disapprove; CNN: 45% approve - 52% disapprove.]SENATE CHOKES ON VIRUS PACKAGE, TEMPERS FLARE Fox News: “Tensions flared on the Senate floor Monday as lawmakers viscerally clashed on camera over phase three of a coronavirus response package, with Democrats blocking Republican efforts to advance the massive stimulus bill for the second day in a row. Leaving the legislation in limbo once more, the Senate stalled over the package Monday afternoon on a 49-46 vote. It needed 60 votes to advance. Democrats argued the more-than $1 trillion package did too much for large corporations and not enough for workers, but Republicans accused them of playing politics and using the crisis as leverage to try and jam through unrelated political ‘wish list’ items concerning climate change and more. ‘The country is burning, and your side wants to play political games,’ Senate Majority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., said shortly before the vote. … Thune slammed Democrats—specifically moderate Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., who just moments earlier said the bill was ‘weighted toward the Wall Street corporation side.’”Details of the package - USA Today: “Senate Republicans released a $1-trillion economic stimulus plan last Thursday, which details a proposal to distribute a $1,200 payment for each individual or $2,400 for joint returns. Democrats blocked the bill earlier Sunday evening, saying it was too generous to big corporations and too stingy for working families. Among the requirements Senate Democrats are wanting to include to pass the bill are: Requiring President Donald Trump to invoke the Defense Production Act to order private companies to manufacture respirators, masks and other needed equipment. Providing more workers guaranteed paid family and medical leave. Using nearly $40 billion to help states stabilize school funding and help colleges continue operating during the crisis. Giving states billions in grant funding to help hold elections, including expanding early, absentee and mail voting. … Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer [said] on Monday … ‘We have the obligation to get the details right.’”Republicans say Dems blocking over ‘ideological wish list’ - Fox News: “Republicans are accusing Democrats of using the coronavirus pandemic as an opportunity to push unrelated political agendas, as the two sides failed to reach an agreement Sunday night to advance legislation that would provide relief to American businesses and families struggling as a result of the outbreak. … But issues having nothing to do with coronavirus have become impediments to the relief package, according to a senior Republican aide. ‘As Leader Schumer continues to hold up the desperately-needed relief package, the last-minute list of demands from Pelosi’s and Schumer’s ideological wish list are coming into focus,’ the aide said. These include new collective bargaining powers for unions, higher fuel emissions standards for airlines, and expanded wind and solar tax credits.”Pergram: How it fell apart - Fox News: “‘Monday’ was supposed to be the deadline for the Senate to act on the third legislative phase of the coronavirus response. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) set up a process late last week where the Senate would take a procedural vote Sunday to begin debate on a ‘shell’ of a bill. Once there was a deal, McConnell would insert the coronavirus package into the parliamentary empty box. The hope was that the Senate could get 60 yeas to open debate on the coronavirus measure Sunday – then speed up the process and pass the bill Monday. Then the House would have to move to align with the Senate sometime in the near future. That all melted down Sunday night. Republicans were always going to need buy-in by Senate Democrats to start debate on the legislation. As we always say on Capitol Hill, it’s about the math, it’s about the math, it’s about the math. The current Senate breakdown is 53 Republicans and 47 senators who caucus with the Democrats. The procedural vote required 60 yeas to overcome a filibuster.”PAUL BASHED FOR IGNORING WARNINGSNYT: “[Sen. Rand Paul] had been informed last weekend that he had attended a fund-raiser in Kentucky with two individuals who later tested positive for Covid-19, a warning that sent a handful of other prominent elected officials into self-quarantine out of caution. Not Mr. Paul. He pressed on with his Washington schedule anyway. On Wednesday afternoon, he spoke and voted on the Senate floor. He dined at the Republicans’ closed luncheon on Thursday and on Friday, sitting with fellow senators. … [Senator Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., wrote on Twitter,] ‘This, America, is absolutely irresponsible.’ … Both of Utah’s Republican senators, Mitt Romney and Mike Lee, said Sunday afternoon that they would voluntarily quarantine themselves after close contact with Mr. Paul in recent days.”Senators call for remote voting - Roll Call: “Bipartisan efforts to encourage the Senate to adopt procedures for remote voting are gaining steam, with at least two more Republicans speaking out for the need to make operational changes in the face of the coronavirus crisis and one day after a Senate colleague revealed he tested positive for the virus. Republican Sens. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina endorsed the Senate moving to remote voting during the growing COVID-19 pandemic. They join an effort led by Illinois Democrat Richard J. Durbin and Ohio Republican Rob Portman, who are calling for limited-time authority for remote voting during emergency situations. ‘I totally support the idea of remote voting so the Senate can continue to operate during this crisis,’ Graham tweeted.”Amy Klobuchar’s husband tests positive - Fox News: “Sen. Amy Klobuchar announced Monday that her husband has tested positive for coronavirus and that he is currently being treated in a Virginia hospital. Klobuchar, D-Minn., a former Democratic presidential hopeful, said her husband received the results of his COVID-19 test on Monday morning. ‘While I cannot see him and he is of course cut off from all visitors, our daughter Abigail and I are constantly calling and texting and emailing,’ Klobuchar said in a statement. ‘We love him very much and pray for his recovery.’ Klobuchar said that her husband is ‘exhausted and sick but a very strong and resilient person.’ Klobuchar described her husband’s symptoms, saying he ‘kept having a temperature and a bad, bad, cough.’”BIDEN CONSULTS OBAMA ON VEEP SHORTLISTPolitico: “Joe Biden has a shortlist of more than six women to be his running mate and will start the vetting process ‘in a matter of weeks,’ he said Sunday during a call with donors. Biden, who indicated he had consulted with his former boss, President Barack Obama, didn’t mention any names. But he said nothing to dispel the speculation that he’s considering the three senators who ran against him for president — Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren. ‘Background checks matter. They have to be prepared,’ Biden said, adding that he wants to ensure that ‘there’s not going to be any snafu’ with his selection. ‘The most important thing, and I've actually talked to Barack about this — the most important thing is that there has to be someone who, the day after they’re picked, is prepared to be president of the United States of America if something happened,’ said Biden, who is 77. Biden said he needs ‘someone who is comfortable with where I am’ on policy.”How Bernie blew it - NYT: “But interviews with more than three dozen [Sen. Bernie Sanders] aides, elected officials, activists and other people who worked with his campaign revealed a more extensive picture of his reversal of political fortune. Though Mr. Sanders climbed to a position of seeming dominance by mid-February, he and his inner circle also made a series of fateful decisions that left him ill positioned to win over skeptical Democrats — and sorely vulnerable to an opponent with Mr. Biden’s strengths. Mr. Sanders proved unable to expand his base well beyond the left or to win over African-Americans in meaningful numbers. He failed to heed warnings from traditional party leaders, and even from within his campaign, about the need to modulate his message and unify Democrats. He allowed internal arguments to fester within his campaign, an ungainly operation that fragmented into factions beneath the only two real decision makers — Mr. Sanders and his wife, Jane. Though outwardly amiable, Mr. Sanders’s inner circle fractured between some long-serving counselors and relative newcomers, like Faiz Shakir, his campaign manager.”Pressures mount on DNC - WSJ: “When the Democratic National Committee decided to move its convention up to mid-July—roughly two weeks earlier than in 2016—it was billed as a way to give the party’s nominee more time to focus on President Trump and spend general election dollars earlier. The coronavirus pandemic is making that move seem riskier in retrospect, as Democrats face the possibility that much of the nation will be hunkered down for weeks or months to come.”PLAY-BY-PLAYTrump approves National Guard requests in New York, California and Washington state - NBC NewsAUDIBLE: OLD BAY IN THE EYES MAY CAUSE BURNING“Wash your hands like you got done eating a pile of Maryland crabs and you need to take your contacts out.” – Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, D-Md., per CNN.FROM THE BLEACHERS“What are your thoughts about people referring to the current situation as the ‘new normal?’ This term really, really grates on me. It should never be normal for our government to tell us when we can and cannot leave our homes and who can leave. This is a temporary extraordinary ABNORMAL situation that we have to get through.  We should never normalize this sort of government power.” – Steve Arthur, Arlington, Va.[Ed. note: Mr. Arthur, did you ever hear the one about the guy who goes to the doctor and says “Doctor, it hurts every time I go like this,” and raises both of his hands over his head? The doctor says “Well, don’t do that.” I don’t know how much of what kinds of news and social media you’re consuming on a given day, but I do know that with so much time on their hands and so few diversions, many Americans are over-indulging. You are certainly right that the extraordinary powers currently being asserted by leaders from the president down to city councils and county commissions are not sustainable, and some are probably unconstitutional. By the time this is all done, we will have new laws, new precedents and, yes, new norms. Those are matters of great importance. But just make sure you’re not letting the spouting of your fellow citizens “really, really grate” on you. Social media and 24-hour news have put us in greater proximity to human ignorance on a large scale than ever in our society’s history. These can be wonderful tools, but they can also become intellectual and emotional tar pits in which we can become mired. Some of us even find ourselves out there looking for trouble, as it were. Outrage is a powerful emotion and it can become habit forming. Save your outrage for things that matter and not just letting knuckleheads on the internet mess up your day.] “We Michiganders appreciate the Boston Cooler reference [in Friday’s Halftime Report]!

I was introduced to the wonders of the Boston cooler by Bill Hogan, the wisest man in Wheeling, W.Va. He got it from an aunt 80 years ago who I believe was from Boston. I had no idea that there was a Michigan constituency! But what I was able to give Bill was the superiority of the tangy, almost spicy Vernors in place of paler imitations. But even a Canada Dry Boston cooler would be preferable to the far more pedestrian root beer float. Just make sure you use super-premium vanilla ice cream -- above 14 percent milkfat -- if you want to maximize the quality of the froth, which we all know is the best part of all.]“‘What It Takes’ by Richard Ben Cramer has always been my go-to choice for a non-fiction political book.” – Shayne Smith, Little Rock, Ark.[Ed. note: It is a fantastic book, no doubt!

I have another two for you – ‘The Art of Grace – on Moving Well Through Life’ – by Sarah Kaufman, and ‘Geography of Genius’ – by Eric Weiner. I think we could all benefit, and use, a little more grace in our dealings with each other. The second book is amazing as it documents why specific locations, at specific points in time, thrived.  What is one of the common denominators? You guessed it – adversity.” – Dani Marquardt, Carol Stream, Ill.[Ed. note: I read and enjoyed Mr. Weiner’s book! It is a bit of a romp! And it’s fun to imagine what it would have been like to have been, as they say, present at the creation. And as he reminds us, the people living in places where human potential finds new flowering often don’t know it at the time. You and I may be living there now. And that is the best part about the human experience. While we fear the unknown, it is the surprises that make life worth living.

Saturday, Najera drove Ms. Gonzalez to each of the 25 student’s houses while Gonzalez called the parents on the phone and asked them to send their kids to the front porch.

"                          Republican Sen. Susan Collins lectures Democrats for having 'no sense of urgency' and delaying the coronavirus stimulus package. An impassioned Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, tore into Senate Democrats on Monday for lacking ""urgency"" ahead of another attempt to pass a stimulus package to fight the coronavirus and boost the economy, stating bluntly: ""We don't have another minute to delay acting."" ""I cannot believe that the answer to this crisis – as we move to address the economic consequences that are so severe for the people of this country – that the answer from our friends on the other side of the aisle is delay, delay, delay. No sense of urgency. No hurry,"" Collins said on the Senate floor. A GOP-backed stimulus bill failed to clear a procedural hurdle Sunday night after Democrats complained that the draft aid package did not go far enough to provide health care and unemployment aid for Americans. Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell teed the bill up for another vote on the matter Monday afternoon. First to speak during an hour of debate for that vote was Collins, who also took at aim at Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. ""Here we are facing an enemy that is invisible but ... devastating to the health of our people and to the health of our economy,"" Collins said. ""And yet unbelievably the Democratic leader objected to my even being able to speak this morning. Is this what we've come to? The Democratic leader objected to our convening at 9 a.m. this morning so that we could begin working in ... earnest."" CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW Collins' comments come amid a pandemic that has cut the stock market's value by about 30 percent over the course of weeks and threatens to overwhelm the American health care system. ""We don't have another day. We don't have another hour. We don't have another minute to delay acting,"" Collins said. ""How can any of us want to see millions of Americans lose their paychecks, their health insurance, their contributions to their retirement plans? We have a package that's part of this broader legislation."" REPUBLICANS SAY DEMS BLOCKING CORONAVIRUS RELIEF OVER 'IDEOLOGICAL WISH LIST' Collins is known as one of the most moderate Republicans in the Senate and as an institutionalist. But she is also known for giving passionate speeches from the Senate floor, including one oration explaining her vote on the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh that marked the point at which his confirmation became a near certainty. The veteran senator acknowledged on Monday that it is unlikely that every member of the body would agree on the details of a package, but emphasized the necessity to ""get the job done for the American people."" Collins' comments come after Senate Republicans ushered through a $100 billion second-stage coronavirus bill passed by the House without any amendments last week. It also came minutes after Schumer and McConnell had just finished ripping into each other over their disagreements on the coronavirus bill and seconds before an argument between McConnell and Sen. Joe Manchin D-W.Va. on the Senate floor over the upcoming vote. IN BRIEF CORONAVIRUS 'BRIEFING,' BIDEN CALLS FOR UNITY AND TAKES AIM AT TRUMP The tension led Sen.

"                          House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy reacts to Nancy Pelosi saying she is going to start from scratch and craft another coronavirus relief bill Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.  Sign up here. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi introduced her own emergency coronavirus stimulus bill on Monday, leading furious Republicans to argue that much of the proposal contained a progressive wishlist seemingly unrelated to the crisis -- including several provisions that amount to a resurrection of the notorious ""Obamaphone"" program, GOP officials said. The bill proposed by Pelosi, D-Calif., additionally seeks to eliminate debt held by the U.S. Postal Service, require same-day voter registration, pay off $10,000 in student debt per person, mandate that airlines reduce their overall carbon emissions by 50 percent by 2050, and force federal agencies to explain to Congress how they are increasing their usage of ""minority banks."" And, the legislation would provide for the automatic extension of nonimmigrant visas and restrict colleges from providing information about citizenship status. It would also allocate $35 million to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. ""People are dying and all Nancy Pelosi and Democrats can focus on is ripping off the American taxpayer to help pay for their liberal wish list of government handouts,"" National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) spokesman Michael McAdams said in a statement. ""As long as the White House keeps the checkbook open, Democrats will keep taking things,"" a senior Senate GOP leadership source told Fox News late Monday. The NRCC went on to accuse Pelosi of cramming the bill ""full of unrelated liberal goodies, including a return of the 'Obamaphone.'"" Pelosi, the NRCC pointed out, wants $1 billion ""to build on program expanded by President Obama that provides discounted phone service for low-income consumers."" That was an apparent reference to Title III, Section 301 of Pelosi's bill, which allocates $1 billion and calls for federal authorities to immediately expand the ""emergency lifeline broadband benefit"" for every household that contains at least one ""qualifying low-income consumer."" The bill refers to the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) to define the broadband benefit. Title 47, Section 8.1(b) of the CFR defines ""broadband internet access service"" as including cell phones, saying it is any ""mass-market retail service by wire or radio that provides the capability to transmit data to and receive data from all or substantially all internet endpoints, including any capabilities that are incidental to and enable the operation of the communications service."" A comprehensive 2017 report from the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that that the ""Obamaphone"" program, which gave cell phones to poor people under the broadband benefit, stashed $9 billion in private bank accounts and was ""rife with fraud,"" the Washington Times reported at the time. TENSIONS FLARE ON CAPITOL HILL AS STIMULUS BILL GOES UP IN FLAMES The program -- officially known as the Lifeline Program and run by the Federal Communications Commission -- predated President Obama but received attention during his time in office when recipients began to associate the free phone with other benefits given to the poor. Former Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Democrat who called for the GAO report, blasted the ""Obamaphone"" program for lack of oversight. “A complete lack of oversight is causing this program to fail the American taxpayer — everything that could go wrong is going wrong,” McCaskill said. “We’re currently letting phone companies cash a government check every month with little more than the honor system to hold them accountable, and that simply can’t continue.""       House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of Calif. speaks outside her office on Capitol Hill, Monday, March 23, 2020. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, Pool)       The GAO report found that about 10.6 million people have an Obamaphone, but 36 percent of them may not qualify. The audit also concluded that more than 5,500 people were found to be enrolled for two phones, while the program was paying for about 6,400 phones for persons the government has listed as dead, the paper reported. On the Senate floor Monday evening, Republican senators lined up to hammer what they described as Pelosi's pork, and her derailment of their stimulus proposal. Senate Republicans and Democrats had a tentative agreement on a bill before Pelosi, arriving back to Capitol Hill from recess, suddenly said she would introduce her own legislation. ""Today, 102 Americans died while the Democrats blocked consideration of this bill,"" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said at one point. ""One Texan died while this chamber decided not to show up for work and do their job."" Cruz also hit Democrats for seeking to bail out the U.S. Postal Service, which hasn't suggested it will terminate any employees. ""One of the reasons the Democrats think they will get away with this is they expect the media to be utterly complicit,"" Cruz added, noting that The New York Times conspicuously changed its headline three times Sunday evening to describe how Democrats had killed Republicans' stimulus bill. The Times' first headline, ""Democrats Block Action on $1.8 Trillion Stimulus,"" eventually became, ""Partisan Divide Threatens Deal on Rescue Bill."" Leaving the GOP stimulus legislation in limbo once more, the Senate stalled over the package Monday afternoon on a 49-46 vote. It needed 60 votes to advance. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., then stormed to the floor to accuse Democrats of ""mindless obstruction"" that could drag out any action for days. He said Democrats' list of demands keeps getting ""longer and longer."" After 7 p.m. ET, after hours of additional argument, McConnell announced, “We’ll not be having any votes tonight.” He filed cloture again to halt debate on the effort to start debate on the “shell” bill. By the book, the new cloture petition won’t “ripen” for a vote until Wednesday. Lawmakers must allow for an “intervening day""; Tuesday is the intervening day -- but the Senate could technically then meet at 12:01 a.m. ET on Wednesday, and vote within an hour, given that time is of the essence. They would need 60 yeas just to vault the procedural hurdle and formally start debate later in the week. “Hope springs eternal,"" McConnell told Fox News as he left the floor, concerning whether a deal could be reached. “As you know, the talks continue no matter where people are physically located.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., also offered an optimistic note as he left the Senate floor for the day, saying negotiations aren't ""slowing down one bit"" into the night, and asserting that “the list of outstanding issues has narrowed significantly.” Democrats argued the more-than $1 trillion package did too much for large corporations and not enough for workers, and inaccurately suggested that the treasury secretary would have unilateral control over a massive ""slush fund."" Republicans accused them of playing politics and using the crisis as leverage to try and jam through unrelated political ""wish list"" items concerning climate change and more. “The country is burning, and your side wants to play political games,” Senate Majority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., said shortly before the vote. “It is time to get this done.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)       Moderate Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, blasted Democrats as “disgraceful” for delaying further work on the legislation. Pelosi, meanwhile, assailed Trump's idea and fluctuating response to the crisis. ""He's a notion-monger, just tossing out things that have no relationship to a well-coordinated, science-based, government-wide response to this,"" Pelosi said on a health-care conference call. ""Thank God for the governors who are taking the lead in their state. Thank God for some of the people in the administration who speak truth to power.” At the Capitol, the virus continued to strike close. Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who announced he tested positive for coronavirus, is now among five senators under self-quarantine. Several other lawmakers have cycled in and out of isolation. And the husband of Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., is in a hospital with pneumonia after testing positive, she said Monday. Senate Democrats express concern that major corporations will use financial assistance the way they did in the 'Great Recession,' including enhanced executive compensation and stock buybacks. But, Democrats were reluctant to allow remote voting. “We can’t always remote vote,” one House Democratic aide told Fox News. “If we let the toothpaste out of the tube, how do we put it back in?” The House took three years in the early 1970s to implement its current electronic voting system. That’s why there’s concern about throwing together a system to remote vote now with encryption and authentication. “Think about how bad the app was in Iowa,” said one Democratic leadership source, a reference to the disaster this winter with the Iowa Democratic Caucus.

President Trump demanded on Monday that the Senate “stop playing partisan politics” and pass a massive stimulus bill meant to jumpstart a flagging economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic, while saying he hopes the administration's guidelines on social distancing will end soon and not go on for ""months."" “They must pass the Senate bill as written and stop playing partisan politics,” Trump said during an evening news conference with the White House coronavirus task force. “They have to make a deal.” He added: “This should not be a time for political agendas."" Trump struck a much more somber tone than some of his previous press conferences on the outbreak, admitting that the numbers of people infected are going to rise. He did say, however, that he was optimistic that the country could begin opening up again in weeks, not months. ""I’m not looking at months,"" he said. ""This is going away. We’re going to win the battle."" During the lengthy press conference, the president -- who recently tested negative for the virus -- revealed that first lady Melania Trump has also been tested and the results came back negative. Also during the briefing, taskforce member Dr. Deborah Birx revealed she had a low-grade fever over the weekend and tested negative, too. While Trump did not specifically call out Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., or other Democrats in the Senate, his comments on Thursday hit on arguments made by his fellow Republicans that Democrats are using the coronavirus pandemic as an opportunity to push unrelated political agendas. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW During a speech on the Senate floor earlier in the day, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., McConnell accused Democrats of trying to extract concessions from airlines over their ""carbon footprint,"" with the economy hanging in the balance. “They ought to be embarrassed,” he said. “This is no time for this nonsense.” Among the demands Schumer wants included in the bill are new collective bargaining powers for unions, higher fuel emissions standards for airlines, and expanded wind and solar tax credits. Democrats had also complained that the draft aid package did not go far enough to provide health care and unemployment aid for Americans, and failed to put restraints on a proposed $500 billion ""slush fund"" for corporations, saying the ban on corporate stock buy-backs are weak and the limits on executive pay would last only two years. “We Democrats are trying to get things done, not making partisan speech after partisan speech,” Schumer said earlier Monday while calling the legislation an exclusively Republican-authored bill. REPUBLICANS SAY DEMOCRATS BLOCKING CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL OVER 'IDEOLOGICAL WISHLIST' Speaking to reporters Monday, Trump said that the bill needed to be passed to mitigate any more financial fallout from the COVID-19 outbreak. “This is not a country meant to be shut down,” he said. “We are not going to let this turn into a long-lasting financial problem.” It seems, however, unlikely that any legislation will be voted ono the Senate on Monday as Schumer and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin continue to work out a version of the bill that will appease both sides. Along with the Senate bill, Trump during the briefing also addressed concerns about price gouging and reports of people hoarding medical supplies – such as face masks and hand sanitizer – that are desperately needed by health care workers battling to stop the spread of the contagion.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Earlier in the day, Trump signed an executive order meant to curtail price gouging and hoarding, and also warned that federal law enforcement would take strict measures in prosecuting any person found to hoarding, raising prices, or selling fake cures for the pathogen. “It will be a crime to stockpile these necessities,” Trump said. “As president, I will always fight against Americans being exploited.” Speaking to reporters, Trump also called out the reports of hostility directed at Asian-Americans amid the outbreak. Trump has been criticized by Democrats for labeling the contagion the “Chinese virus” but has denied the term is racist. He claims he uses the phrase as part of an attempt to be accurate about where the first cases originated. “The spreading of the virus is not their fault,” Trump said of Asian-Americans. The White House press briefing was noticeably less crowded then it was even a day ago as the administration enacted strict limits on the number of people admitted to the briefing after it was reported that a member of the press corps has a ""suspected case"" of the coronavirus. Trump acknowledged that reporters were now practicing social distancing and wish the journalist a speedy recovery. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Amid negotiations over how lawmakers should respond to the coronavirus pandemic, Rahm Emanuel has reprised his famous rallying cry from his 2008 financial crash: Never let a crisis go to waste. Speaking during an interview on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday, the former Chicago mayor and chief of staff to President Barack Obama brought back his infamous quote from the 2008 financial collapse in an attempt to highlight that the government can learn from its mistakes when dealing crises. “Never allow a crisis to go to waste,” Emanuel said Sunday. “Start planning for the future. This has to be the last pandemic that creates an economic depression. We're going to have more pandemics, but this has to be the last economic depression.” CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Emanuel’s famed comment – which has since become an often repeated catchphrase by economists and policymakers when discussing stressed financial and economic systems – quickly drew heat from Republicans who accused Democrats of trying to push forward unrelated polices into the $2 trillion stimulus bill currently being negotiated in the Senate.  “Democrats are using Rahm Emanuel's playbook of never letting a crisis go to waste,” Marc Lotter, the director of strategic communications for President Trump’s reelection campaign, tweeted. “Their demands have NOTHING TO DO with helping the American people - this is about fulfilling their liberal wish list/Green New Deal.” Arguably the most controversial aspect of the proposal, the initial GOP plan called for $208 billion in loans to larger businesses like airlines, which would have to be repaid, and a subsequent version released over the weekend called for $500 billion. SENATE DEMS PROPOSE ADDITIONAL $200 IN MONTHLY SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS, AMID CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK With the specter of the 2008 government bailouts still looming, Democrats say the deal provides too much support for big companies with little oversight and not enough for working Americans.

"                          Dr. Alex Greninger shares insight on COVID-19 pandemic from the University of Washington Virology Lab. The United States was ranked the best-prepared country in the world to handle a pandemic in late 2019 by the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) and the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security (JHU) -- an assessment seemingly at odds with claims by Democrats that the Trump administration left the country vulnerable to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. The Global Health Security Index was was ""developed with guidance from an international panel of experts from 13 countries, with research by the Economist Intelligence Unit,"" The Washington Post reported last year. ""More than 100 researchers spent a year collecting and validating publicly available data.” At the same time, the paper noted that the U.S. score was still not perfect, and that ""factors driving down the U.S. score include the risks of social unrest and terrorism, and low public confidence in government."" SEE THE FULL 2019 GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY INDEX RANKINGS President Trump's campaign has argued in recent days that misinformation may be one of the leading causes of that lack of confidence. For example, Trump's team has pointed to claims by presidential contender Joe Biden that ""no one on the National Security Council staff was put in charge"" of pandemic preparedness, based on a report that in May 2018, then-National Security Adviser John Bolton eliminated the NSC’s Office of Global Health Security and Biodefense in a reorganization effort. Rear Adm. R. Timothy Ziemer reportedly was ousted as senior director, and no replacement was named. But, FactCheck.org has determined that the matter amounted to a reorganization, and that “some team members [of the NSC pandemic office] were shifted to other groups, and others took over some of [the top official’s] duties.” The White House says the NSC remains involved in responding to the coronavirus pandemic. A senior administration official said earlier this month that the NSC’s global health security directorate was absorbed into another division where similar responsibilities still exist, but under different titles. The work of coordinating policy and making sure that decisions made by Trump’s coronavirus task force are implemented is still the job of the NSC. Separately, the Biden team has repeatedly argued that the president once referred to coronavirus as a ""hoax."" That claim has been refuted by numerous fact-checkers, including the Post's, which found that Trump was clearly referring to Democrats' efforts to blame him for the pandemic, not the virus itself. PELOSI'S STIMULUS BILL CONTAINS PROVISIONS FOR OBAMAPHONES, CLIMATE CHANGE PREVENTION Additionally, numerous Democrats, including Biden, have falsely claimed that the president cut the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) budget. The Associated Press has noted that those claims ""distort"" the facts. Trump’s budgets have proposed cuts to public health, only to be overruled by Congress, where there’s strong bipartisan support for agencies such as the CDC and NIH. Instead, financing has increased. Indeed, the money that government disease detectives first tapped to fight the latest outbreak was a congressional fund created for health emergencies. Some public health experts say a bigger concern than White House budgets is the steady erosion of a CDC grant program for state and local public health emergency preparedness — the front lines in detecting and battling new disease. But that decline was set in motion by a congressional budget measure that predates Trump. “The CDC’s response has been excellent, as it has been in the past,” said John Auerbach, president of the nonpartisan Trust for America’s Health, which works with government at all levels to improve the nation’s response to high-risk health crises. Some Democrats have charged that Trump decimated the nation’s public health leadership, but Auerbach said CDC’s top scientific ranks have remained stable during the past three years.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)       Nevertheless, misleading reports about the Trump campaign's pandemic response efforts have continued to spread. A recent report by Reuters that the U.S. had recently terminated a CDC position in China was widely cited by Democrats and reporters as evidence of a lack of preparedness, and formed the basis for a reporter's question at a recent White House coronavirus briefing. But, the article itself made clear that experts didn't think the move had anything to do with the spread of coronavirus in the United States. ""One disease expert told Reuters he was skeptical that the U.S. resident adviser would have been able to get earlier or better information to the Trump administration, given the Chinese government’s suppression of information,"" the outlet noted. “In the end, based on circumstances in China, it probably wouldn’t have made a big difference,” former CDC epidemiologist and Emory University professor Scott McNabb told Reuters. “The problem was how the Chinese handled it,"" McNabb continued. ""What should have changed was the Chinese should have acknowledged it earlier and didn’t.” Regardless, some lawmakers are pushing for more action out of an abundance of caution. Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va., and Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, have introduced a bill that would require future administrations to have experts always in place to prepare for new pandemics. 'Fox News @ Night' anchor Shannon Bream delivers a 2020 update in 60 seconds on the biggest political stories. “Two years ago, the administration dismantled the apparatus that had been put in place five years before in the face of the Ebola crisis,” Connolly said. “I think, in retrospect, that was an unwise move. This bill would restore that and institutionalize it.” Connolly said the bill is not meant to be critical of the Trump administration. He said it’s a recognition that Trump had to name a coronavirus responder just like Obama had to name one for Ebola in 2014. “We can’t go from pandemic to pandemic,” Connolly said. The House Foreign Affairs Committee on March 4 passed the measure, which is co-sponsored by 37 Democrats and five Republicans.

The Trump administration on Monday vowed to go after price gougers and those who hoard crucial medical supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic that has seen store shelves emptied and the cost of basic necessities skyrocket in some areas. At a White House press briefing, Trump said he signed an executive order earlier in the day that would prohibit the accumulation of supplies such as hand sanitizer, face masks and personal protective equipment in order to profit off the virus. In an effort to address coronavirus-related scams, federal prosecutors recently shut down a website that sold a fake coronavirus vaccine, he said.

The order gives Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar the authority to designate certain supplies as scarce or as supplies threatened by people accumulating excessive amounts. Those found to be hoarding supplies or price gouging could face criminal prosecution. Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department has seen evidence of price gouging and hoarding in recent weeks. “Once specific materials are so designated, persons are prohibited from accumulating those items in excess of reasonable personal or business needs or for the purpose of selling them in excess of prevailing market prices,” Barr said.

"                          The end of the 15-day 'slow the spread' period may tee up a battle between health and economic officials on what to do next; Kristin Fisher reports from the White House. It’s not much of a shock to discover that Rachel Maddow doesn’t like President Trump’s daily briefings on the coronavirus. “I feel like we should inoculate ourselves against the harmful impact of these ongoing false promises and false statements by the president by recognizing that when he’s talking about the coronavirus epidemic, more often than not, he is lying,” she told her MSNBC viewers. What is rather surprising is what Maddow wants to do about it, an idea that is gaining cachet among other commentators on the left as well. FORGET THE DEBT: WHY TRUMP AND POLS WANT A TRILLION-DOLLAR BAILOUT “If it were up to me, and it’s not, I would stop putting those briefings on live TV,” she said. “Not out of spite, but because it’s misinformation.” Think about that for a second. Some liberals, who ordinarily cast themselves as champions of free speech, now want to suppress speech because of their animus toward Donald Trump. Yes, Trump would still be able to hold White House briefings, but they would literally pull the plug on live coverage, depriving millions of Americans of the chance to see not just him but the vice president, surgeon general and assorted medical experts. This is the height of condescension. What they’re saying is that Americans are too dumb to understand that some of what Trump says might be positive spin or factually inaccurate. Only the pundits and the press are smart enough to figure that out, so they will watch the president and then filter what you need to know. ""If the president does end up saying anything true, you can run it as tape,” Maddow allows. But beyond that, “all of us should stop broadcasting it. Honestly, it’s going to cost lives.” Washington Post columnist Margaret Sullivan, whose writings drip with disdain for Trump and for media people who she believes enable him, says efforts such as fact-checking “don’t go nearly far enough to counter the serious damage this man is doing to the public’s well-being. Radical change is necessary: The cable networks and other news organizations that are taking the president’s briefings as live feeds should stop doing so.” Just censor him. That’s what the argument comes down to. And what’s revealing is that the people who are making this case have spent years denouncing the president in ever harsher terms. Sullivan recently wrote that Trump is so dangerous that “we need to abandon neutrality-at-all-costs journalism, to replace it with something more suited to the moment.” The larger message is a clarion call for journalists to crusade against Trump, abandoning such niceties as fairness as a luxury we can no longer afford. The president tweeted Monday that he watches “CNN, MSDNC, ABC, NBC, CBS, some of FOX (desperately & foolishly pleading to be politically correct), the @nytimes, & the @washingtonpost, and all I see is hatred of me at any cost. Don’t they understand that they are destroying themselves?” I was struck when Trump used that word -- “hatred” -- to describe his media detractors in a 2016 interview with me. While it’s true in certain cases, it is far too broad a brush. And, of course, the president goes out of his way to slam the media as a way of discrediting their legitimate criticism of him. He did that last week in accusing, without evidence, the New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal of siding with China on the virus story. He called NBC’s Peter Alexander a “terrible reporter” for pressing him --aggressively, to be sure -- on whether he was offering “false hope” on two unproven drugs and then asking him to address millions of scared Americans. Stephanie Grisham, the president’s press secretary, told me Sunday on “Media Buzz” that his job is “to try to calm the American people,” and so Alexander’s “false hope” question was “wildly inappropriate.” She called on journalists to “set aside their bias against this president, and they need to do what this White House is doing and show leadership and try to get information to the American public.” SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES Now I think it’s perfectly fair to point out, as I did in the interview, that Trump spent weeks minimizing the impact of the coronavirus; it’s all on tape. (She disagreed.) I think it’s perfectly fair to point out that despite his appeals to private business, the president still can’t tell us when the medical system will have enough masks, ventilators and respirators--and that by not invoking the Defense Production Act, he is largely pushing it off on the states. I think it’s perfectly fair to point out that some of Trump’s claims are contradicted by Anthony Fauci, that some of what he says is overly optimistic, that experts don’t believe things will start improving after the current 15-day period that the president has embraced. In fact, the situation is expected to get worse. In short, I think that good journalists can hold Trump accountable for what he says and does, or does not do, without bearing a personal grudge -- and recognizing that an ABC poll has approval of his virus management up sharply, to 55 percent. What I do not think is fair is for television to impose a blackout on the president of the United States because some on the left don’t think the public can handle hearing from him in this crisis.

Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters early Tuesday that he expects Republicans and Democrats in the Senate to come together and reach an agreement on the $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package that set off a fierce debate on the Senate floor and allegations from both sides that the other was politicizing the emergency. Despite the logjam, Schumer, the Senate minority leader, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters that there was progress made in late-night negotiations. Schumer said he expects a vote sometime on Tuesday. PENCE URGES DEMS TO ACT ON BILL One of the key issues in the package is the $500 billion ""Exchange Stabilization Fund.""  Democrats call it a ""slush fund,"" and claim Mnuchin would have far too much influence over which industries would have access to the fund. Mnuchin denied the claim on Fox Business, saying, ""It's not a slush fund; it's a mechanism that we can use working with the Federal Reserve that will provide another $4 trillion of potential liquidity into the market. That’s on top of the Fed’s balance sheet."" A Politico reporter, citing three sources, tweeted that Mnuchin agreed to ""significant oversight"" for the fund in part of the negotiations. President Trump claimed Monday that the Senate Democrats were “playing partisan politics” and should make the deal. “I think we've made a lot of progress,"" Mnuchin told reporters. ""Both sides have been working around the clock."" He said there are a few documents that need to be reviewed and turned around, but he is hopeful they will be resolved Tuesday. Schumer also struck an optimistic tone.  “We expect to have an agreement tomorrow morning. There’s still a few little differences. Neither of us think they’re in any way going to get in the way of a final agreement,” he said. GET THE FOX NEWS APP At around the time Schumer and Mnuchin were leaving the Capitol, Trump re-tweeted a National Review article about last-minute ""ideological demands"" from Democrats that were added to the relief package. The report said these demands included the expansion of wind and solar tax credits and increased fuel emissions standards for airlines.

"                          New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio gives update on coronavirus response. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.  Sign up here. President Trump said Tuesday the federal government plans to send 400 ventilators to New York City, with more equipment on the way. “The World market for face masks and ventilators is Crazy. We are helping the states to get equipment, but it is not easy. Just got 400 Ventilators for @NYCMayor Bill de Blasio,” Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. “Work beginning on 4 hospitals in New York! Millions of different type items coming!” The shipment represents a fraction of the 15,000 ventilators Mayor Bill de Blasio called for last week as the city and state become the epicenter of coronavirus in the United States. De Blasio repeatedly has sounded the alarm on the shortage of ventilators in New York City hospitals, as many COVID-19 patients need the machines to help them breathe. CORONAVIRUS VENTILATOR DEMAND  De Blasio has also sought millions of N-95 masks and more Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for medical professionals. ""If we don’t get ventilators this week, we are going to lose lives we could have saved — I can’t be blunter than that,” de Blasio said on CNN Monday. New York now has more than 23,000 positive cases of coronavirus in the state, with roughly half of that in New York City. De Blasio, over the weekend, said he had asked for Trump to use the Defense Production Act to acquire ventilators for patients suffering from the illness. On Tuesday, the president said the act was ""in full force,"" but that he did not need to use it: ""The Defense Production Act is in full force, but haven’t had to use it because no one has said NO! Millions of masks coming as back up to States."" The Defense Production Act, which was first enacted in 1950 as a response to the Korean War and has since been re-invoked more than 50 times, is meant to streamline the production of medical supplies to help the country battle the coronavirus pandemic and require businesses to sign contracts or fulfill orders deemed necessary for national defense. Under the act, companies are required to accept and prioritize contracts from the government and to prioritize “materials, services and facilities to promote the national defense or to maximize domestic energy supplies.” While this provision has historically been used to ramp up military production, amid the COVID-19 pandemic the act will be used for medical supplies. Meanwhile, Trump also referred to the temporary hospitals in New York City. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced over the weekend four sites in the state that will serve as additional space for hospitals overflowing due to the coronavirus outbreak. CUOMO SAYS TEMPORARY HOSPITALS IN NEW YORK TO INCLUDE JAVITS CENTER  The four initial sites recommended by the Army Corps of Engineers are the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City, locations at SUNY Stony Brook in Long Island, SUNY Old Westbury and the Westchester Convention Center. ""We have a plan of action to help stop the spread of this virus, including expanding hospital capacity and identifying new hospital beds, and after meeting with the Army Corps of Engineers and hearing their recommendations, we stand ready for the building of temporary hospitals at four facilities in New York State,” Cuomo said Saturday. The sites were identified by an inspection team led by the Army Corps of Engineers and included state officials from New York’s Office of General Services, the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York, the New York Department of Health and the New York State Division of Military and Naval Affairs. The team visited more than a dozen sites to review their capability to serve as temporary hospitals, Cuomo’s office said. The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic earlier this month. As of Tuesday morning, the U.S. had more than 46,000 positive cases across the country. Nearly 600 people have died.

People who go outside for reasons other than health care, food, picking up education materials, taking care of others, or exercise between March 25 and April 30 can be charged with a misdemeanor that carries a maximum penalty of one year in jail and a $5,000 fine.

Alaska considers it a class A misdemeanor to intentionally violate a quarantine or isolation order, with a maximum sentence of a year in jail and a $10,000 fine. In Mississippi, existing law calls for a maximum punishment of five years behind bars and a $5,000 for ""knowingly and willfully"" violating a quarantine order.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. As Senate Republicans were reeling late Monday following two unsuccessful procedural votes on their version of a coronavirus response bill, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., released her chamber's version of legislation to fight the disease and its economic effects -- and it includes a raft of provisions with questionable relevance to the pandemic that has killed more than 17,000 worldwide and sickened more than 390,000. The $2.5 trillion package includes many of the same elements as the Senate bill, which is still being negotiated as of Tuesday morning -- Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says he expects to vote on a Senate bill by Tuesday night. These similarities include support for workers and small businesses financially impacted by the large-scale economic slowdown from stemming the spread of the outbreak; help for hospitals and health care workers in need of personal protective equipment (PPE) and other supplies; tax breaks for average Americans; direct cash assistance to all adult Americans and other measures directly applicable to the crisis at hand. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW But it also includes a number of other measures that have rankled Republicans, including funding for the Kennedy Center -- a performing arts center in Washington, D.C. -- the elimination of the U.S. Postal Service's debt to the treasury, a requirement that airlines accepting assistance under the bill have a union representative on their board, environmental regulations for airlines and more. STATES THREATENING JAIL TIME OVER CORONAVIRUS ORDERS' VIOLATIONS Pelosi argued that the Senate bill, unlike the House's, would ""put corporations first, not workers and families."" Republicans, on the other hand, argued that Democrats are using the pandemic to push through the left's agenda items under the pretense of a bill to fight the coronavirus. ""They ought to be embarrassed,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said of similar proposals being pushed by Senate Democrats. ""There is no time for this nonsense."" Here's some of what's in the House Democrats' $2.5 trillion, 1,404-page bill. Diversity provisions The House Democrats' bill requires that any company getting coronavirus-related aid disclose its diversity stats, including its employees' race, gender, pay, corporate board diversity and the structure of its offices that deal with diversity and inclusion. The reports, which will be made public within a year of the companies accepting federal coronavirus-related assistance, will also include the ""number and dollar value invested with minority-and-women owned suppliers ... including professional services (legal and consulting) and asset managers, and deposits and other accounts with minority depository institutions, as compared to all vendor investments."" EXPECT A CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS AGREEMENT IN SENATE, SCHUMER SAYS Post Office bailout One section of the bill would eliminate $11 billion worth of debt for the U.S. Postal Service -- money that it currently owes to the Treasury Department. It would also require the Treasury to ""eliminate the $3 billion annual borrowing limit in current law,"" according to a summary of the bill released by House Democrats. Union boosting In addition to requiring each airline that receives money through the bill to have a union representative on its board, the House Democrats' summary says the bill would nullify a variety of executive orders issued by the Trump administration on collective bargaining. Environmental provisions Any airlines that accept assistance from the House Democrats' bill would be forced to ""offset their carbon emissions and reduce their overall emissions by 50 percent by 2050."" That matches with environmental plans from Democratic presidential candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders to have the U.S. reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The House bill would also expand an FAA program that incentivizes airports to purchase environmentally friendly equipment and create a ""cash for clunkers"" program -- similar to one created by the Obama administration for cars -- but for older airplanes. STOCKS SOAR AS SENATE WORKS TOWARD $1.6T STIMULUS PACKAGE Additionally, it will provide $1.2 billion in grants over five years for the production of ""sustainable aviation fuels"" that reduce greenhouse gas emissions by ""at least 30 percent"" compared to traditional jet fuel. Obamaphones One section of Pelosi's bill allocates $1 billion and calls for federal authorities to immediately expand the ""emergency lifeline broadband benefit"" for every household that contains at least one ""qualifying low-income consumer."" That would include any ""mass-market retail service by wire or radio that provides the capability to transmit data to and receive data from all or substantially all Internet endpoints, including any capabilities that are incidental to and enable the operation of the communications service."" That benefit would include cell phones. The National Republican Congressional Committee said the House bill is ""full of unrelated liberal goodies, including the return of the Obamaphone,"" a program that the Government Accountability Office found was ""rife with fraud"" according to a Washington Times report at the time. Newspaper retirement plans House Democrats' plan, according to its summary, expands a recent law that provides ""pension funding relief for a number of community newspaper plan sponsors."" $15 minimum wage for companies accepting assistance Two different sections in the House Democrats' summary of the bill address minimum wage. One provision would ""require corporations that receive any federal assistance"" to pay all of its workers at least $15 per hour. In addition to the minimum wage, that same provision includes a ban on golden parachutes, restricted bonuses and compensation for executives, a ban on stock buybacks and a ban on companies changing their collective bargaining agreements. Kennedy Center The House Democrats' bill provides $35 million to ensure that the D.C.-based John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts is able to remain operational and pay its expenses during the coronavirus-related economic slowdown. BIPARTISAN HOUSE RESOLUTION CONDEMNS CHINESE GOVERNMENT OVER HANDLING OF CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE The next page of the bill indicates that $300 million would be allotted for the National Endowment of the Arts with an additional $300 million for the National Endowment of the Humanities. Voter registration The House Democrats' bill has a variety of election-related mandates, including that states allow at least 15 days of early voting for elections and no-excuse absentee mail-in voting -- two things that could be useful in holding elections during the continuing coronavirus threat. But is also prohibits states from ""imposing additional conditions or requirements on the eligibility of a voter to cast an absentee ballot such as notarization or witness signatures, and prohibits requiring identification to obtain an absentee ballot."" It also forces states to allow same-day voter registration, a practice that is becoming more common throughout the U.S. but is far from universal.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.  Sign up here.  President Trump on Tuesday blasted what he described as “nonsense” in coronavirus response bills, calling on Congress to approve critical economic aid “today.” “This is not about the ridiculous Green New Deal. It is about putting our great workers and companies BACK TO WORK!” Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. “Congress must approve the deal, without all of the nonsense, today,” he continued. “The longer it takes, the harder it will be to start up our economy. Our workers will be hurt!” The president’s tweet comes after Senate Democrats blocked legislation from moving forward for the second time on Monday, claiming the plan did too much for large corporations and not enough for workers. Republicans accused them of playing politics and using the crisis as leverage to try and jam through unrelated political “wish list” items concerning climate change and more. The Senate may be getting close to a deal. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday, ""We're very close."" But the House is another matter. House Democrats, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., offered their own version of a coronavirus stimulus bill on Monday. But buried inside the massive proposal are a host of items that Republicans charge are unrelated to the COVID-19 outbreak. HOUSE DEMS' EMERGENCY PROPOSAL INCLUDES $35M FOR KENNEDY CENTER FOR PERFORMING ARTS It does not contain the ""Green New Deal,"" as Trump's tweet suggested, but it does call for airlines that take aid to reduce their overall carbon emissions by 50 percent by 2050. The bill also seeks to eliminate debt held by the U.S. postal service, require same-day voter registration, pay off $10,000 in student debt per person, and force federal agencies to explain to Congress how they are increasing their usage of “minority banks.” The legislation also would provide for the automatic extension of nonimmigrant visas and restrict colleges from providing information about citizenship status. The bill also would allocate $35 million to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. PELOSI'S CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS INCLUDES RETURN OF 'OBAMAPHONES,' UNRELATED ITEMS Senate Republicans and Democrats had a tentative agreement, along with consultation from the White House, on a stimulus bill, before Pelosi returned to Capitol Hill from recess. Some Republicans have blamed the House for allegedly scrambling Senate talks. The Senate’s draft legislation would have provided payments of up to $1,200 per person. They would be phased down at adjusted gross income thresholds of $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 per couple. The amount is reduced to zero for single taxpayers with incomes exceeding $99,000 and $198,000 for joint filers. Central to the package was as much as $350 billion for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home, and billions in loans to airlines and other industries. Democrats, though, want constraints on the largely Republican-led effort to provide $500 billion for corporations, which Democrats have called a ""slush fund.""

"                          Dr. Alex Greninger shares insight on COVID-19 pandemic from the University of Washington Virology Lab. The United States was ranked the best-prepared country in the world to handle a pandemic in late 2019 by the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) and the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security (JHCHS) -- an assessment seemingly at odds with claims by Democrats that the Trump administration left the country vulnerable to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. The Global Health Security Index was was ""developed with guidance from an international panel of experts from 13 countries, with research by the Economist Intelligence Unit,"" The Washington Post reported last year. ""More than 100 researchers spent a year collecting and validating publicly available data.” At the same time, the paper noted that the U.S. score was still not perfect, and that ""factors driving down the U.S. score include the risks of social unrest and terrorism, and low public confidence in government."" SEE THE FULL 2019 GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY INDEX RANKINGS President Trump's campaign has argued in recent days that misinformation may be one of the leading causes of that lack of confidence. For example, Trump's team has pointed to claims by presidential contender Joe Biden that ""no one on the National Security Council staff was put in charge"" of pandemic preparedness, based on a report that in May 2018, then-National Security Adviser John Bolton eliminated the NSC’s Office of Global Health Security and Biodefense in a reorganization effort. Rear Adm. R. Timothy Ziemer reportedly was ousted as senior director, and no replacement was named. But, FactCheck.org has determined that the matter amounted to a reorganization, and that “some team members [of the NSC pandemic office] were shifted to other groups, and others took over some of [the top official’s] duties.” The White House says the NSC remains involved in responding to the coronavirus pandemic. A senior administration official said earlier this month that the NSC’s global health security directorate was absorbed into another division where similar responsibilities still exist, but under different titles. The work of coordinating policy and making sure that decisions made by Trump’s coronavirus task force are implemented is still the job of the NSC. Separately, the Biden team has repeatedly argued that the president once referred to coronavirus as a ""hoax."" That claim has been refuted by numerous fact-checkers, including the Post's, which found that Trump was clearly referring to Democrats' efforts to blame him for the pandemic, not the virus itself. PELOSI'S STIMULUS BILL CONTAINS PROVISIONS FOR OBAMAPHONES, CLIMATE CHANGE PREVENTION Additionally, numerous Democrats, including Biden, have falsely claimed that the president cut the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) budget. The Associated Press has noted that those claims ""distort"" the facts. Trump’s budgets have proposed cuts to public health, only to be overruled by Congress, where there’s strong bipartisan support for agencies such as the CDC and NIH. Instead, financing has increased. Indeed, the money that government disease detectives first tapped to fight the latest outbreak was a congressional fund created for health emergencies. Some public health experts say a bigger concern than White House budgets is the steady erosion of a CDC grant program for state and local public health emergency preparedness — the front lines in detecting and battling new disease. But that decline was set in motion by a congressional budget measure that predates Trump. “The CDC’s response has been excellent, as it has been in the past,” said John Auerbach, president of the nonpartisan Trust for America’s Health, which works with government at all levels to improve the nation’s response to high-risk health crises. Some Democrats have charged that Trump decimated the nation’s public health leadership, but Auerbach said CDC’s top scientific ranks have remained stable during the past three years.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)       Nevertheless, misleading reports about the Trump campaign's pandemic response efforts have continued to spread. A recent report by Reuters that the U.S. had recently terminated a CDC position in China was widely cited by Democrats and reporters as evidence of a lack of preparedness, and formed the basis for a reporter's question at a recent White House coronavirus briefing. But, the article itself made clear that experts didn't think the move had anything to do with the spread of coronavirus in the United States. ""One disease expert told Reuters he was skeptical that the U.S. resident adviser would have been able to get earlier or better information to the Trump administration, given the Chinese government’s suppression of information,"" the outlet noted. “In the end, based on circumstances in China, it probably wouldn’t have made a big difference,” former CDC epidemiologist and Emory University professor Scott McNabb told Reuters. 'Fox News @ Night' anchor Shannon Bream delivers a 2020 update in 60 seconds on the biggest political stories. “The problem was how the Chinese handled it,"" McNabb continued. ""What should have changed was the Chinese should have acknowledged it earlier and didn’t.” Regardless, some lawmakers are pushing for more action out of an abundance of caution. Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va., and Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, have introduced a bill that would require future administrations to have experts always in place to prepare for new pandemics. “Two years ago, the administration dismantled the apparatus that had been put in place five years before in the face of the Ebola crisis,” Connolly said. “I think, in retrospect, that was an unwise move. This bill would restore that and institutionalize it.” Connolly said the bill is not meant to be critical of the Trump administration. He said it’s a recognition that Trump had to name a coronavirus responder just like Obama had to name one for Ebola in 2014. “We can’t go from pandemic to pandemic,” Connolly said. The House Foreign Affairs Committee on March 4 passed the measure, which is co-sponsored by 37 Democrats and five Republicans.

"                          2020 Democrat hopeful Joe Biden kicks off what he says will be daily livestreams on the coronavirus response. A new national poll points to an extremely close contest between President Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden as the race for the White House shifts to a likely general election battle between the two.  Biden, the former vice president and all-but-certain 2020 Democratic presidential nominee, stands at 48 percent support among registered voters nationwide in a Monmouth University poll, with the GOP incumbent at 45 percent. Biden’s slight 3-point edge over Trump is within the poll’s sampling error, meaning the race is roughly tied between the two candidates.  BIDEN FIGHTS TO RETURN TO PUBLIC EYE AFTER BEING SIDETRACKED BY CORONAVIRUS Three percent said they would vote for an independent candidate in November’s general election, and 4 percent said they were undecided in the survey, which was conducted March 18-22 and released on Tuesday. According to the poll, the president enjoys a nearly 2-to-1 margin over Biden in the 2,500 solidly red counties that Trump overwhelming won four years ago over 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. In the 360 solidly blue counties where Clinton crushed Trump, Biden is up by a 2-to-1 margin. But in the approximately 300 swing counties where the margins in the 2016 presidential election were 10 points or less, Biden tops Trump 50-41 percent. “The race looks tight right now between Trump and the probable Democratic nominee. But as we learned in 2016, the outcome will be determined by the Electoral College rather than the national popular vote. The poll results suggest Biden may actually be starting out with an advantage in crucial swing areas of the country,” Monmouth University Polling Institute Director Patrick Murray said in a statement. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN As expected, there’s a wide partisan divide, with Democrats backing Biden 89-6 percent and Republicans behind the president 90-7 percent. Independents are nearly dead even, with 45 percent for Trump and 44 percent for the former vice president. Biden leads 56-34 percent among voters under age 35, Trump has a 53-40 lead among those 35 to 54 and Biden has a slight 4-point advantage among voters 55 and older. It’s been a week since Biden swept major primaries in Florida, Illinois, and Arizona – cementing his position as the likely Democratic presidential nominee and all but closing Sen. Bernie Sanders’ narrow pathway to the White House. The same day, Trump officially clinched the GOP presidential nomination. The Monmouth University poll was conducted using live telephone operators, with 754 registered voters nationwide questioned. The survey’s sampling error is plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.

"                          Defense Secretary Mark Esper provides an update on the federal government's response to the coronavirus Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.  Sign up here. Top Pentagon officials warned Tuesday that the coronavirus outbreak will last in the U.S. for at least the next “three months” —  a stark contrast from President Trump’s prognosis earlier this week. Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Tuesday from the Pentagon estimated that the country could grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic rocking the nation for at least 10 weeks. TRUMP HOPES CORONAVIRUS GUIDELINES WON'T LAST 'FOR MONTHS' “It looks like it has an eight- to 10-week period,” Esper said. “We need to plan for this to be a few months long, at least, and we are taking all precautionary measures to do that, to be in it for the long haul.” Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Army Gen. Mark Milley took it a step further. “You’re looking at eight to 10, maybe 12 weeks, something like that, call it three months,” Milley said. “Some of that depends on what we do as a nation to mitigate it, to flatten that curve so to speak. But we, the United States military, we’re going to do this as long as the mission takes.” The comments from top Defense Department officials come after Trump, on Monday, signaled that he would be ready to open portions of the U.S. economy in the coming days — suggesting it could come as soon as the end of his “15-days to slow the spread” initiative, which is set to expire before April 1. Trump, on Monday, admitted that the number of people infected by COVID-19 in the U.S. is going to rise, but said he was optimistic that the country could begin opening up again in weeks, not months. ""I’m not looking at months,"" he said. ""This is going away. We’re going to win the battle.” Meanwhile, Esper also said he expected the U.S. Navy hospital ship, USNS Comfort, to arrive in New York City harbor from Norfolk, Va., in “less than 14 days.” CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW The USNS Comfort has 1,000 beds and is run by military personnel. Esper has warned, however, that the ship’s capabilities are “focused on trauma” rather than infectious disease. ""Whether it's our field hospitals or our hospital ships, they are focused on trauma. They do not have necessarily the space, the segregated space, to deal with infectious disease,"" Esper told Fox News' Bret Baier last week. ”We don't have any 500-bed hospitals designed for infectious disease ... That does not exist in the inventory.” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo had requested the ship, after warning of the stress on New York state hospitals. The state’s hospital system only has 53,000 beds. New York has become the epicenter of the virus in the U.S., with more than 23,000 positive cases of coronavirus — roughly half of that in New York City. On Monday, Esper announced that in addition to the hospital ships deploying, the U.S. Army would be setting up field hospitals in New York and Seattle to take some of the pressure off local hospitals overwhelmed with COVID-19 cases. “Right now, I anticipate sending a hospital to Seattle and a hospital to New York City,"" he said Monday. ""And beyond that, once that's confirmed, we will look at sending to other places.” The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic earlier this month. As of Tuesday morning, the U.S. had more than 46,000 positive cases across the country. Nearly 600 people have died.

President Trump on Tuesday gave yet another signal that he wants to loosen restrictions placed on families and businesses in response to the coronavirus crisis — as the end of the White House’s 15-day time frame approaches its final days. “Our people want to return to work,” Trump tweeted. “They will practice Social Distancing and all else, and Seniors will be watched over protectively & lovingly. We can do two things together. THE CURE CANNOT BE WORSE (by far) THAN THE PROBLEM! Congress MUST ACT NOW. We will come back strong!” WHAT'S IN DEMOCRATS' CORONAVIRUS BILL? ARTS FUNDING, UNION HELP AND MORE  Trump has increasingly shown signs he is keen to reverse the shuttering of American life that has caused significant economic harm across the country because of the spread of the disease. ""We can’t have the cure be worse than the problem,” he said at a White House briefing on Monday evening. An increasing number of states, including New Jersey, California, Michigan and New York, have implemented “stay-at-home” orders which have seen schools and businesses close and busy cities transformed overnight into ghost towns. Such orders limit travel to the bare essentials, block non-essential workers from going to work, and forbid large gatherings. The White House itself has encouraged social distancing, and last week urged Americans to adopt a plan that sees “15 days to slow the spread” — which includes recommendations such as working from home where possible, avoiding non-essential travel, practicing good hygiene and avoiding restaurants. Those 15 days would end next week, unless Trump decides to extend it. But as the economy has nosedived and predictions of a recession increasingly circulate, Trump has indicated that he wants to get Americans on the path back to normal life again. He has given no firm timeline for such a return, but indicated that it would not be the months that some experts and officials have said it will take. Defense Secretary Mark Esper estimated Tuesday that the outbreak could take up to 10 weeks, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Army Gen. Mark Milley, went a little further saying he expected the military to be dealing with the virus for the next three months. STATES THREATENING JAIL TIME OVER CORONAVIRUS ORDERS' VIOLATIONS ""You're looking at 8 to 10 maybe 12 weeks something like that, call it three months,"" Milley said. ""Some of that depends on what we do as a nation to mitigate it, to flatten that curve so to speak. But we, the United States military we're going to do this as long as the mission takes."" But Trump said he wants it to be a matter of weeks instead. ""I’m not looking at months,"" he said on Monday. ""This is going away. We’re going to win the battle."" Trump also said at that press conference that the economic penalties have their own, sometimes deadly, tolls as well.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell warned Tuesday that the “clock has run out” for “bargaining” on the third phase of a coronavirus response package, urging Congress to pass legislation “today.” From the Senate floor just a day after Democrats blocked the latest COVID-19-related legislation from moving forward, McConnell, R-Ky., gave a dire warning to members. TRUMP BLASTS 'NONSENSE' IN CORONAVIRUS BILL, CALLS ON CONGRESS TO APPROVE AID “This is a national crisis. It’s the most serious threat to Americans’ health in over a century and quite likely the greatest risk to American jobs and prosperity that we’ve seen since the Great Depression,” McConnell said. “The urgency and gravity in this moment cannot be lost on anyone.” McConnell went on to say that “every day, every hour Congress delays passing significant relief efforts, we risk livelihoods.” “The clock has run out. The buzzer is sounding. The hour for bargaining as though this were business as usual has expired.” McConnell’s comments come after Democrats, for the second time, on Monday blocked the legislation from moving forward, claiming the plan did too much for large corporations and not enough for workers. Republicans accused them of playing politics and using the crisis as leverage to try and jam through unrelated political “wish list” items concerning climate change and more. But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have indicated that negotiations are yielding progress, and the chamber could be close to a deal and a new vote. Mnuchin said Tuesday, ""We're very close."" The Senate’s draft legislation would have provided payments of up to $1,200 per person. Central to the package was as much as $350 billion for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. Democrats, though, want constraints on the largely Republican-led effort to provide $500 billion for corporations, which Democrats have called a ""slush fund.” “Everyone needs help,” McConnell said Tuesday. “We’re all in this together. We need an all-of-the-above approach. Help for workers and families and employers and health care providers.” TENSIONS FLARE ON SENATE FLOOR AS CORONAVIRUS BILL DERAILED BY DEMOCRATS FOR THE SECOND TIME  Even if the Senate can advance legislation, however, what happens on the House side remains to be seen. House Democrats, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., offered their own version of a coronavirus stimulus bill on Monday. But buried inside the proposal are a host of items that Republicans charge are unrelated to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign is being called out for claiming that President Trump had ""silenced"" an official with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) who early on spoke of the severity of the coronavirus outbreak. A video posted by Biden's campaign Twitter account features Ron Klain, the Obama administration's Ebola response coordinator, who said that ""anyone who raised an alarm about this, a red flag, was silenced,"" referring specifically to Dr. Nancy Messonnier, who addressed the seriousness of the problem on Feb. 25 in a phone briefing.

The Washington Post called this claim ""false"" and gave it ""Four Pinocchios,"" pointing out that this was ""simply wrong"" in their Fact Checker column. While noting that Trump was reportedly unhappy with how Messonnier's words affected the market, the Post's Glenn Kessler pointed out that moving forward Trump had Messonier's superior, CDC principal deputy director Anne Schuchat, at briefings, even though Schuchat had previously relayed a message similar to what Messonier had said. This, Kessler pointed out, was consistent with other steps Trump took to address the seriousness of the matter: holding briefings at the White House instead of the Department of Health and Human Services and putting Vice President Pence in charge of the coronavirus task force, which had been run by Health Secretary Alex Azar.

Biden's remarks, livestreamed from a studio set up in his home, were short compared with the president's near-daily coronavirus briefings, lasting less than 15 minutes in total. Trump's all-hands-on-deck press conferences often run over an hour. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW But the former vice president covered a range of topics including the president's coronavirus response, what he would do if he were in the Oval Office, the lessons that can be learned from governors' actions to fight the coronavirus, the Senate Republicans' stimulus proposal and a lawsuit backed by the Trump administration and Republican attorneys general to strike down ObamaCare on constitutional grounds. Biden called on Republicans to drop that lawsuit. ""It's worth noting that today is the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Affordable Care Act. I'm proud of the role I played alongside President Obama backing him up to bring Obamacare into the law,"" Biden said. ""But also today in the middle of one of the largest public health emergencies in generations, the White House and Republican attorneys general are actively pursuing a lawsuit to invalidate the ACA in court. They're working to strip millions of Americans of their health care and tens of millions of their protections for preexisting conditions."" JOE BUCK WILL CALL PLAY-BY-PLAY FOR CORONAVIRUS-ERA HOME VIDEOS: 'I'D LOVE TO GET SOME PRACTICE REPS IN' He continued: ""I sent a letter this morning with a simple request, withdraw the lawsuit please."" On the Senate Republicans' coronavirus response bill, Biden said it focused too much on corporate America and not enough on individuals struggling because of the pandemic. This, after Senate Democrats blocked the massive economic rescue package on Sunday, sending negotiators scrambling to reach a deal. ""As of last night President Trump and [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell were offering a plan to let big corporations off the hook,"" Biden said. ""They proposed a $500 billion slush fund for corporations with almost no conditions. Under their plan, the Trump administration could even allow companies to use the money ... being given to them .. to buy back stocks, increase executive pays, if that's what the secretary of the treasury decided. They wouldn't have to make commitments to keep workers employed."" Biden also had some advice for Trump on his daily briefings and his coronavirus response. ""Later today you'll hear from the president in his daily briefing. These briefings are an important opportunity to inform and reassure the American public. They're not a place for political attacks or to lash out at the press. They're about the American people,"" Biden said. ""So I hope today and in the days ahead the president will give us the unvarnished truth. That's what the American people need and what they deserve."" He also said: “Trump keeps saying he is a wartime president, well, start to act like one. … Donald Trump is not to blame for the coronavirus, but he does bear responsibility for our response.” JOE BIDEN'S CORONAVIRUS PLAN: WHAT'S IN IT? Biden's move to essentially hold his own briefings amid the coronavirus pandemic is unusual, considering they are sure to offer a starkly different message than the daily briefings out of the White House during a time of national emergency. But they also come as the former vice president must keep a high profile, asserting himself as the presumptive nominee even as the numerous primary delays tied to the pandemic prevent him from officially locking down the nomination and beating lone remaining rival Bernie Sanders. And the gaffe-prone but affable former vice president couldn't make it through the novel briefing by a candidate without one awkward moment. As he was detailing his plan to fight the coronavirus crisis, Biden appeared to lose track of his spot on the teleprompter. He signaled to his staff that there was something wrong, before going off on an awkward ad-lib. ""And uh, in addition to that, uh in addition to that we have to make sure that we uh, we are in a position that we are, well met me go the second thing, I've spoke enough on that,"" Biden said before going on to speak about the aggressive action he would like Trump to take under the Defense Production Act. Trump’s reelection campaign is firing back, accusing Biden of trying to politicize the crisis. ""By preying upon Americans’ fear amid the coronavirus outbreak, Biden isn’t just playing cheap politics. He’s making the crisis worse. It’s dangerous,” the campaign said in an email. ""Biden's Monday morning quarterbacking is an effort to sow anger and division among Americans."" Biden on Monday also criticized Trump for not warning Americans urgently enough and acting fast enough to fight the coronavirus, citing his own comments about the coronavirus on Jan. 27. ""The mindset that was slow to recognize the problem in the first place, to treat it with the seriousness it deserved, is still too much a part of how the president is addressing the problem,"" Biden said. Biden then sounded the alarm on the need for work on treatments and vaccines for the coronavirus, employing the Defense Production Act to get masks and ventilators to health care professionals caring for those sick with the coronavirus, stepping up testing and more — mostly along the lines of recommendations he made in a detailed coronavirus response plan over a week ago. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Above all, Biden's address seemed aimed at making him seem like the adult in the room — the experienced statesman who has dealt with this before and can unite the country around a common cause. ""When we've stood as one, this nation has never ever been defeated... and we're not going to be defeated now,"" Biden said. ""The pandemic of 1918, the Great Depression, two world wars, we overcame them all. And out of each crisis we emerge stronger, and we will again. This new enemy may be unseen, but we have the tools, the expertise and most importantly the spirit to defeat it.""

"                          President Trump reveals when he decided to take action against coronavirus and what lead to his decision to close off China from the U.S. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.  Sign up here. President Trump said Tuesday during a Fox News virtual townhall that he wants the country’s economy re-opened by Easter amid questions over how long people should stay home and businesses should remain closed to slow the spread of coronavirus. Speaking from the Rose Garden alongside others on his coronavirus taskforce, Trump said he ""would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter."" The holiday this year lands on April 12. Trump also reiterated his argument that he doesn’t want “to turn the country off” and to see a continued economic downfall from the pandemic. LIVE BLOG: FOX NEWS HOSTS VIRTUAL CORONAVIRUS TOWN HALL WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP ""We lose thousands and thousands of people a year to the flu. We don't turn the country off,” Trump said during the interview. Trump added: “We lose much more than that to automobile accidents. We don't call up the automobile companies and say stop making cars. We have to get back to work.” The president's prediction that the U.S. economy would be up-and-running by Easter, however, was tempered by comments earlier in the day by top officials at the Pentagon who predicted the COVID-19 outbreak could last anywhere from 10 weeks to three months. During a coronavirus town hall with U.S. forces around the world, Defense Secretary Mark Esper estimated it could take up to 10 weeks, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Army Gen. Mark Milley went a little further saying he expected the military to be dealing with the virus for the next three months. Trump's enthusiasm for getting people back to work also comes as he takes stock of the political toll the outbreak is taking. It sets up a potential conflict with medical professionals, including many within his government, who have called for more social restrictions to slow the spread of the virus, not fewer.  Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading expert on infectious diseases and a member of the White House’s coronavirus task force, told WMAL on Tuesday that Trump has always heeded his recommendations. “The president has listened to what I have said and to what the other people on the task force have said when I have made recommendations he has taken them. He's never countered or overridden me, the idea of just pitting one against the other is just not helpful,” Fauci said. Trump also called on the Senate to pass a massive stimulus bill that is currently being debated between Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. The president blamed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for demanding a number of additional stipulations to the bill for the delay in its passage in the Senate. “I cancelled the deal last night because Nancy Pelosi put in a lot of things that had nothing to do with the workers,” Trump said. “They start throwing Green New Deal stuff in, and the board rooms what they will look like…They have things that are just terrible, windmills everywhere.” Arguably the most controversial aspect of the proposal, the initial GOP plan called for $208 billion in loans to larger businesses like airlines, which would have to be repaid, and a subsequent; a version released over the weekend called for $500 billion. Democrats have complained that the Republican-led draft of the aid package did not go far enough to provide health care and unemployment aid for Americans, and failed to put restraints on a proposed $500 billion ""slush fund"" for corporations, saying the ban on corporate stock buy-backs are weak and the limits on executive pay would last only two years. Schumer said Democrats also want included in the bill new collective bargaining powers for unions, higher fuel emissions standards for airlines, and expanded wind and solar tax credits. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., McConnell accused Democrats of trying to extract concessions from airlines over their ""carbon footprint,"" with the economy hanging in the balance. “They ought to be embarrassed,” he said on Monday. “This is no time for this nonsense.” CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE The nearly $2 trillion stimulus package would include direct financial help to Americans in the form of stimulus checks sent out to many Americans. The proposal would include a one-time payment of $1,200 per adult, $2,400 per couple in the U.S. and up to $3,000 for a family of four. An estimated $350 billion would be provided for small businesses to keep making payroll. Companies with 500 or fewer employees could tap up to $10 million each in forgivable small business loans to keep paychecks flowing. The program would provide 8 weeks of assistance through federally guaranteed loans qualifying employers who maintain payroll; if they do, other costs like mortgage interest, rent, and utilities would be forgiven. The bill also includes an additional $242 billion in additional emergency appropriations to fight the virus and shore up for safety net programs. That includes money for food stamps, child nutrition, hospitals, the Centers for Disease Control and public health and transportation agencies. The figure has gone significantly higher during talks over the weekend. Fox News' Lucas Tomlinson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

A federal judge forcefully denied Michael Cohen's request to either be set free early or serve the rest of his sentence under home confinement after he claimed that the coronavirus outbreak presents a danger that makes it unsafe for him to remain in prison. Judge William H. Pauley III was not swayed by Cohen's request for leniency. To the contrary, he suggested the outbreak made for a cynical justification for the former Trump attorney's request after a previous attempt to secure a lighter sentence failed. MICHAEL COHEN SHARES PETITION FOR TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO SEND PRISONERS HOME DURING CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK ""Apparently searching for a new argument to justify a modification of his sentence to home confinement, Cohen now raises the specter of COVID-19,"" Pauley wrote in a Tuesday order. ""That Cohen would seek to single himself out for release to home confinement appears to be just another effort to inject himself into the news cycle."" Last week, Cohen appeared to try a different avenue for early release, as his Twitter account shared an online petition calling for the president to have the Federal Bureau of Prisons allow prisoners like him to be released and placed under home detention during the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. So far, he has had no luck with that. Pauley agreed with prosecutors that Cohen ""is 'manifestly ineligible' for compassionate release and has not exhausted his administrative remedies."" Cohen began serving a three-year sentence on May 6, 2019, following a guilty plea to offenses including campaign finance violations, various financial crimes and providing false statements to Congress. GOP REPS MAKE CASE FOR NEW CHARGES AGAINST EX-TRUMP LAWYER MICHAEL COHEN After his sentencing, Pauley pointed out, Cohen tried to get a reduced sentence by working with federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, but then ""made material and false statements in his post-sentencing proffer sessions."" Pauley added that after Cohen had failed to show how he helped prosecutors with their investigations, he then accused the prosecutors of acting improperly. ""Those ad hominem attacks lack any substance and do not trigger the right to a remedy or a hearing before this court,"" Pauley wrote. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The judge noted that the ""fatal flaw"" with Cohen's motion for a reduced or modified sentence — made under Rule 35(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure — is that only the prosecution can file a motion of this nature. ""Ten months into his prison term, it's time that Cohen accept the consequences of his criminal convictions for serious crimes that had far-reaching institutional harms,"" Pauley wrote. ""For these reasons, Cohen's application to reduce or modify his sentence is denied.""

"                          Vice President Mike Pence addresses a small business owner offering insight on what the Trump administration is doing to provide payroll support and help families Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.  Sign up here. Vice President Pence said Tuesday the federal government sent 2,000 ventilators from the national stockpile to the state of New York, which has become the epicenter of coronavirus in the U.S., and vowed to send 2,000 more on Wednesday. “I just received word, and the challenge the state of New York faces. Earlier today, FEMA, from the national stockpile, shipped 2,000 ventilators to the state of New York,” Pence said during Fox News’ virtual coronavirus town hall Tuesday. PENCE SAYS WH NOT CONSIDERING NATIONAL QUARANTINE AMID CORONAVIRUS “Tomorrow, there will be another 2,000 ventilators shipped from the national stockpile,” Pence said. “We have a ways to go yet, it’s the reason why we’re marshaling all the resources, not just from national stockpiles but from our existing supply in hospitals, and that equipment can be converted.” Pence went on to stress to “the people in New York” that the 2,000 ventilators “were sent directly” to the state. Pence’s comments come after the president tweeted early Tuesday saying that the government had sent just 400 ventilators to New York. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo had requested some 15,000 ventilators to deal with the outbreak in the state. Both de Blasio and Cuomo have repeatedly sounded the alarm on the shortage of ventilators in New York City hospitals, as many COVID-19 patients need the machines to help them breathe. New York now has more than 25,000 positive cases of coronavirus in the state, with roughly half of that in New York City. CUOMO SAYS NEW YORK MAY NEED AS MANY AS 140,000 HOSPITAL BEDS AMID COVID-19 CRISIS IN STATE To help the state grapple with the outbreak, Cuomo has also announced four sites in the state that will serve as additional space for hospitals overflowing due to the coronavirus outbreak. “We projected an apex at 100,000 hospital beds needed,” Cuomo said Tuesday. “The new projection suggests as high as 140,000 hospital beds will be needed.” Cuomo said that the coronavirus curve in the state hasn’t been “flattened” and instead “is actually increasing,” saying the peak of the virus in the state is likely to hit New York in 14 to 21 days. “New York is the canary in the coal mine,” Cuomo said. “New York is going first. We have the fastest and highest rate of infection. What’s happening in New York is going to happen in California, Washington Illinois, it’s just a matter of time.” Cuomo said that once New York has stifled the rate of infection and spread of the virus, it would be able to help other states not yet hit by the illness. Cuomo also vowed to explore every option to expand hospital capacity, including dorms and hotels. “I will turn the state upside down to get the number of beds we need,” he said. COVID-19 was designated a pandemic by the World Health Organization earlier this month. The president declared a national emergency, and governors across the nation have issued executive orders urging residents to stay at home. As of midday Tuesday, the U.S. had at least 46,800 cases in US positive cases of COVID-19. The virus has claimed nearly 600 lives in the U.S. Fox News' Alex Hein contributed to this report.     ",         Pence says 2000 ventilators en route to New York amid coronavirus crisis,         2020-03-24T131935-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/white-house-sent-2000-ventilators-to-ny-will-sent-2000-more-this-week-pence-says,Fox
"                          Dr. Alex Greninger shares insight on COVID-19 pandemic from the University of Washington Virology Lab. The United States was ranked the best-prepared country in the world to handle a pandemic in late 2019 by the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) and the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security (JHCHS) -- an assessment seemingly at odds with claims by Democrats that the Trump administration left the country vulnerable to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. The Global Health Security Index was was ""developed with guidance from an international panel of experts from 13 countries, with research by the Economist Intelligence Unit"" from 2018 to 2019, The Washington Post reported last year. ""More than 100 researchers spent a year collecting and validating publicly available data.” At the same time, the paper noted that the U.S. score was still not perfect, and that ""factors driving down the U.S. score include the risks of social unrest and terrorism, and low public confidence in government."" SEE THE FULL 2019 GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY INDEX RANKINGS President Trump's campaign has argued in recent days that misinformation may be one of the leading causes of that lack of confidence. For example, Trump's team has pointed to claims by presidential contender Joe Biden that ""no one on the National Security Council staff was put in charge"" of pandemic preparedness, based on a report that in May 2018, then-National Security Adviser John Bolton eliminated the NSC’s Office of Global Health Security and Biodefense in a reorganization effort. Rear Adm. R. Timothy Ziemer reportedly was ousted as senior director, and no replacement was named. But, FactCheck.org has determined that the matter amounted to a reorganization, and that “some team members [of the NSC pandemic office] were shifted to other groups, and others took over some of [the top official’s] duties.” The White House says the NSC remains involved in responding to the coronavirus pandemic. A senior administration official said earlier this month that the NSC’s global health security directorate was absorbed into another division where similar responsibilities still exist, but under different titles. The work of coordinating policy and making sure that decisions made by Trump’s coronavirus task force are implemented is still the job of the NSC. Separately, the Biden team has repeatedly argued that the president once referred to coronavirus as a ""hoax."" That claim has been refuted by numerous fact-checkers, including the Post's, which found that Trump was clearly referring to Democrats' efforts to blame him for the pandemic, not the virus itself. PELOSI'S STIMULUS BILL CONTAINS PROVISIONS FOR OBAMAPHONES, CLIMATE CHANGE PREVENTION Additionally, numerous Democrats, including Biden, have falsely claimed that the president cut the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) budget. The Associated Press has noted that those claims ""distort"" the facts. Trump’s budgets have proposed cuts to public health, only to be overruled by Congress, where there’s strong bipartisan support for agencies such as the CDC and NIH. Instead, financing has increased. Indeed, the money that government disease detectives first tapped to fight the latest outbreak was a congressional fund created for health emergencies. Some public health experts say a bigger concern than White House budgets is the steady erosion of a CDC grant program for state and local public health emergency preparedness — the front lines in detecting and battling new disease. But that decline was set in motion by a congressional budget measure that predates Trump. “The CDC’s response has been excellent, as it has been in the past,” said John Auerbach, president of the nonpartisan Trust for America’s Health, which works with government at all levels to improve the nation’s response to high-risk health crises. Some Democrats have charged that Trump decimated the nation’s public health leadership, but Auerbach said CDC’s top scientific ranks have remained stable during the past three years.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)       Nevertheless, misleading reports about the Trump campaign's pandemic response efforts have continued to spread. A recent report by Reuters that the U.S. had recently terminated a CDC position in China was widely cited by Democrats and reporters as evidence of a lack of preparedness, and formed the basis for a reporter's question at a recent White House coronavirus briefing. But, the article itself made clear that experts didn't think the move had anything to do with the spread of coronavirus in the United States. ""One disease expert told Reuters he was skeptical that the U.S. resident adviser would have been able to get earlier or better information to the Trump administration, given the Chinese government’s suppression of information,"" the outlet noted. “In the end, based on circumstances in China, it probably wouldn’t have made a big difference,” former CDC epidemiologist and Emory University professor Scott McNabb told Reuters. 'Fox News @ Night' anchor Shannon Bream delivers a 2020 update in 60 seconds on the biggest political stories. “The problem was how the Chinese handled it,"" McNabb continued. ""What should have changed was the Chinese should have acknowledged it earlier and didn’t.” Regardless, some lawmakers are pushing for more action out of an abundance of caution. Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va., and Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, have introduced a bill that would require future administrations to have experts always in place to prepare for new pandemics. “Two years ago, the administration dismantled the apparatus that had been put in place five years before in the face of the Ebola crisis,” Connolly said. “I think, in retrospect, that was an unwise move. This bill would restore that and institutionalize it.” Connolly said the bill is not meant to be critical of the Trump administration. He said it’s a recognition that Trump had to name a coronavirus responder just like Obama had to name one for Ebola in 2014. “We can’t go from pandemic to pandemic,” Connolly said. The House Foreign Affairs Committee on March 4 passed the measure, which is co-sponsored by 37 Democrats and five Republicans.

"                          Here are the main takeaways of what is in the $2 trillion stimulus package the Senate is working on to ease some of the economic turmoil caused by the coronavirus. **Want FOX News Halftime Report in your inbox every day? Sign up here.**On the roster: Senate poised to pass $2 trillion stimulus/bailout - Trump said to be ready to freeze out Fauci - Not so bully: Biden founders in Trump rebuttal - Just the ramen, pleaseSENATE POISED TO PASS $2 TRILLION STIMULUS/BAILOUTPolitico: “Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that they are ‘very close’ to an agreement on a nearly $2 trillion coronavirus economic rescue package, raising the possibility of a Senate vote on the legislation as early as Tuesday. Following a series of late-night meetings in Schumer's office in the Capitol — and a phone call with President Donald Trump to review the status of the discussions — Mnuchin and Schumer told reporters around midnight that they hope to have the final agreement in place in the morning. ‘There are still documents that are going to be reviewed tonight and turned around, there's still a couple of open issues, but I think we're very hopeful this can be closed out tomorrow,’ Mnuchin said. While Trump had sent a late-night tweet that appeared to slam House Democrats over the demands for the rescue package, Mnuchin claimed it wasn't related to his own discussions with Schumer.”Pelosi nods - Roll Call:  “Speaker Nancy Pelosi began to embrace negotiations driven by the Trump administration and Senate on a financial rescue package Tuesday, in a turnaround that could bolster prospects for a broadly supported deal. Just a day earlier, the California Democrat had introduced a competing House bill that would offer more than $2.5 trillion to counter the pain of job losses and shuttered businesses from the COVID-19 pandemic. House Democrats had said the brewing Senate effort offered insufficient relief. But Pelosi expressed support Tuesday for a Senate deal that was expected to be unveiled within hours. ‘I think there is real optimism that we could get something done in the next few hours,’ she said on CNBC. While the Senate bill is unlikely to fully address concerns of House Democrats, such as expanded family and medical leave, they aren’t deal breakers, she said.”Top Dems push for remote voting - Politico: “The chairman of the House Rules Committee is recommending against bringing lawmakers back to Washington to vote on the nearly $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package. Instead, Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) is suggesting the chamber pass the bill by unanimous consent or a voice vote. The recommendation — made public in a letter and a report sent to Democrats Monday night — comes as the coronavirus continues to spread throughout the country and the Capitol. Two members of the House — Reps. Ben McAdams (D-Utah) and Mario Diaz Balart (R-Fla.) — have tested positive for the virus, with McAdams recently in the hospital. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) also has the virus, and roughly a dozen more lawmakers are in quarantine. … Notably, the report — which was commissioned by Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) — suggests that remote voting is not a viable option at the moment. Remote voting would be ‘one of the biggest rule changes in the last century, in one of the most critical institutions in our country,’ the report says.”TRUMP SAID TO BE READY TO FREEZE OUT FAUCINYT: “President Trump has praised Dr. Anthony S. Fauci as a ‘major television star.’ … But Dr. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, has grown bolder in correcting the president’s falsehoods and overly rosy statements about the spread of the coronavirus in the past two weeks — and he has become a hero to the president’s critics because of it. And now, Mr. Trump’s patience has started to wear thin. So has the patience of some White House advisers, who see Dr. Fauci as taking shots at the president in some of his interviews with print reporters while offering extensive praise for Mr. Trump in television interviews with conservative hosts. Mr. Trump knows that Dr. Fauci, who has advised every president since Ronald Reagan, is seen as credible with a large section of the public and with journalists, and so he has given the doctor more leeway to contradict him than he has other officials, according to multiple advisers to the president.”Poll shows governors receive high praise for handling of crisis - Monmouth University: “The nation’s governors get better marks than the President for handling the COVID-19 outbreak, according to the Monmouth University Poll. Still, Donald Trump receives a net positive rating for his actions around the pandemic and his overall job rating has improved slightly since last month. … More Americans say President Trump has done a good job (50%) rather than bad job (45%) dealing with the coronavirus outbreak. Governors, though, get even better ratings for handling the outbreak, with 72% of the public saying their state’s governor has done a good job to just 18% a bad job. Opinion of how Trump has dealt with the crisis is decidedly partisan, with the number saying he has done a good job ranging from 89% of Republicans to 48% of independents and 19% of Democrats. Public praise for the nations’ governors is much more bipartisan at 76% of Democrats, 73% of Republicans, and 67% of independents saying their governor has done a good job dealing with the situation.”THE RULEBOOK: MAKES THE WORLD GO ‘ROUND“Money is, with propriety, considered as the vital principle of the body politic; as that which sustains its life and motion, and enables it to perform its most essential functions.”  – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 30TIME OUT: WHAT’S A NINE-LETTER WORD FOR PUZZLEAuthor Adrianne Raphel give s us a brief history of word games. Paris Review: “When I began to research the history of crosswords … I was sort of shocked to discover that they weren’t invented until 1913. … But in reality, the crossword is a recent invention, born out of desperation.

The lighting in his newly converted home studio was subpar.

The probable Democratic nominee has a larger edge, though, among voters in key swing counties across the country. … Biden has the support of 48% of registered voters and Trump has the support of 45% if the presidential election was today. … In the nearly 2,500 ‘red’ counties that Trump won by an average of 36 points in 2016, his current standing for this year’s election is similar at 63% who support him and 32% who support Biden. In the 360 ‘blue’ counties that Hillary Clinton won by about 35 points on average, 60% of voters support Biden and 30% back Trump.

The new ad from Priorities USA Action, which plans to spend $6 million on TV and digital ads condemning Trump’s response to Covid-19, began running in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Florida on Tuesday and features Trump quotes juxtaposed against a graph showing the number of positive coronavirus tests in America.

The Senate Leadership Fund, which is run by allies of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, is reserving $67.1 million in TV ads across six Senate states — including McConnell's home state of Kentucky — starting the day after Labor Day and running through Election Day, according to details shared exclusively with POLITICO. The sum is more than double the amount the super PAC booked in its initial TV ad investment for the 2018 midterms and at least $25 million more than they initially booked in 2016. The ads were booked to run in Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine and North Carolina, all states with Republican incumbents that are considered critical to the Senate majority.”PLAY-BY-PLAYAnne Applebaum on the authoritarian tendency in times of pestilence - The AtlanticSen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., accused of securities fraud in shareholder lawsuit - PoliticoFalwell set to bring thousands of students back to Liberty University despite governor’s order  - Richmond Times-DispatchAUDIBLE: THAT SMARTS“You know what the American people are wondering right now, Mr. President?

You wrote it.  Brilliant! Might be worth repeating once in a while! ‘Social media and 24-hour news have put us in greater proximity to human ignorance on a large scale than ever in our society’s history.’ Unfortunately for our society, just because you saw it on the internet or even read it in some news feed doesn’t mean it’s true. Very sad!” – Ted Boers, Rockford, Mich.[Ed. note: Thank you, Mr. Boers! We should all remember that ignorance, the opposite of knowledge, is a danger. But we should also be on guard for its fellow travelers: Falsity, the opposite of truth, and foolishness, the opposite of wisdom. Falsity is worse than ignorance since it can lead us so quickly to disaster. But one of the real dangers of social media immersion is the way it can rob us of our sense of perspective. One of the obligations of responsible journalism is to help consumers understand not just what’s going on, but what matters more. This was easy in the days of newspapers and 30-minute evening newscasts. Things that went on the front page with big headlines were easily deemed to be more important than the article about planting spring bulbs in the lifestyle section. The lead story on the six o’clock news about the war or the election was obviously more important than the kicker at 6:29 about the wacky llama escapade. Journalists do get it wrong, but still, proportionality is a thing. Social media deprives us of these cues. Further, we are inclined to mistake frequency for consequence. If a story or topic is being much discussed, we may mistakenly assume that it matters more. Make sure that the people you love are limiting the lengths of their soaks in the briny bath of social media during these long days. It’s bad for our health.]“You can probably find the details on the internet, but Vernors was originally a Michigan product.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced Tuesday that lawmakers are very close to reaching a deal on a nearly $2 trillion stimulus package meant to address widespread health and economic problems created by the coronavirus outbreak, and that an agreement could be reached ""in the next few hours."" Fresh off what he said was a ""very productive meeting"" with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, White House congressional liaison Eric Ueland and acting White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, Schumer reported on progress that he said includes securing four months' full salary for workers if businesses can no longer afford to keep them.

""What it says is if you lose your job in this crisis, you can be furloughed by your employer. That means you can stay on that employer's worklist; if you have health benefits with the employer you can keep getting them. But, most importantly, the federal government will pay your salary -- your full salary -- for now four months."" Schumer said this assistance -- which he called ""unemployment insurance on steroids"" -- is critical because not only will it protect workers, it will help businesses recover more easily after the crisis is over. The Democratic leader also pointed to his party's efforts to obtain greater funding for hospitals, specifically so they can secure additional beds, masks and ventilators.

When Democrats refused to move forward on the bill Sunday and Monday, they were accused of trying to insert provisions unrelated to the outbreak into the package.

Vice President Pence said Tuesday that the White House is not considering a “nationwide lockdown” or a “stay at home order” amid the coronavirus outbreak. During Fox News’ virtual coronavirus town hall with members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, Pence, responding to a viewer question, sought to quell rumors of a national quarantine. “I can tell you that at no point has the White House Coronavirus Task Force discussed what some people call a nationwide lockdown, or as you describe a stay at home order,” Pence said. WHITE HOUSE '15 DAYS TO SLOW THE SPREAD' OF CORONAVIRUS GUIDELINES “What we’ve done is publish the president’s coronavirus guidelines: the ’15 days to slow the spread.’ This is what we believe every American should be doing because we think we have the chance to significantly reduce the spread of the coronavirus,” he continued. Some states, like New York, New Jersey, California, Connecticut, and Illinois have implemented ‘stay at home' orders -- measures that Pence says the White House supports. “Let me say, as states like California and Illinois and of course New York and elsewhere have taken strong measures, President Trump and I fully support decisions by state and local officials that may be stronger than this,” Pence said, referring to the White House ’15-day’ plan. The guidelines advised that older people and those with underlying health conditions “stay home and away from other people.” Officials recommended that large swaths of the population isolate themselves and everyone avoid social gatherings or groups of more than 10 people. READ: CORONAVIRUS GUIDELINES RELEASED BY WHITE HOUSE They also said Americans should work from home if possible; avoid eating or drinking in bars and restaurants; and “avoid discretionary travel, shopping trips, and social visits.” Next Monday, March 30, is the last day of the 15-day plan. The president, on Monday, suggested that he could soon be ready to re-open portions of the U.S. economy. ""I’m not looking at months,"" Trump said Monday. ""This is going away. We’re going to win the battle."" But top Pentagon officials on Tuesday, including Defense Secretary Mark Esper, said they estimated the coronavirus crisis to continue for at least 8 to 10 weeks, possibly three months. “It looks like it has an eight- to 10-week period,” Esper said Tuesday.  “We need to plan for this to be a few months long, at least, and we are taking all precautionary measures to do that, to be in it for the long haul.” Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Army Gen. Mark Milley took it a step further. “You’re looking at eight to 10, maybe 12 weeks, something like that, call it three months,” Milley said. “Some of that depends on what we do as a nation to mitigate it, to flatten that curve so to speak. But we, the United States military, we’re going to do this as long as the mission takes.” COVID-19 was designated a pandemic by the World Health Organization earlier this month. The president declared a national emergency, and governors across the nation have issued executive orders urging residents to stay at home. As of midday Tuesday, the U.S. had at least 46,800 cases in US positive cases of COVID-19.

Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden was mocked on Monday after the gaffe-prone 2020 Democratic front-runner appeared to lose his train of thought when his teleprompter malfunctioned during remarks on the coronavirus pandemic. Biden's remarks, livestreamed from a studio set up in his home, began with his touching his face despite ongoing warnings not to do that during the coronavirus pandemic. His remarks were also short compared with the president's near-daily coronavirus briefings, lasting less than 15 minutes in total, and featured a clear teleprompter issue that became a social media punchline. JOE BUCK WILL CALL PLAY-BY-PLAY FOR CORONAVIRUS-ERA HOME VIDEOS: 'I'D LOVE TO GET SOME PRACTICE REPS IN' The former vice president was detailing his plan to fight the coronavirus crisis, but appeared to lose track of his place on the teleprompter. Biden signaled to his staff that there was something wrong, before going off on an awkward ad-lib. ""And, in addition to that, in addition to that we have to make sure that we, we are in a position that we are, well met me go the second thing, I've spoken enough on that,"" Biden said before going on to speak about the aggressive action he would like Trump to take under the Defense Production Act. “Joe Biden when the teleprompter stops working is a train wreck,” social media strategist Caleb Hull wrote. Biden -- who had been oddly silent during the pandemic until Monday -- covered a range of topics including what he would do if he were in the Oval Office and the lessons that can be learned from governors' actions to fight the coronavirus – but some viewers harped on the blunders. “What a disaster,” GOP spokesperson Elizabeth Harrington wrote. “Biden has had plenty of time to think about this, and he can't even figure out what to say without help from a teleprompter.” JOE BIDEN'S CORONAVIRUS PLAN: WHAT'S IN IT?

"                          'More people will die if we allow this to continue,' says President Trump discussing if it's realistic for American to return to work by April 12 Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. President Trump said Tuesday during a Fox News virtual townhall that he wants the country’s economy re-opened by Easter amid questions over how long people should stay home and businesses should remain closed to slow the spread of coronavirus. Speaking from the Rose Garden alongside others on his coronavirus taskforce, Trump said he ""would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter."" The holiday this year lands on April 12. Trump argued he doesn’t want “to turn the country off” and see a continued economic downfall from the pandemic. He also said he worries the U.S. will see ""suicides by the thousands"" if coronavirus devastates the economy. PENCE SAYS WHITE HOUSE NOT CONSIDERING A NATIONWIDE CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWN ""We lose thousands and thousands of people a year to the flu. We don't turn the country off,” Trump said during the interview. Trump added: “We lose much more than that to automobile accidents. We don't call up the automobile companies and say stop making cars. We have to get back to work.” Taking questions before Trump, Vice President Mike Pence said the administration is not considering a nationwide coronavirus lockdown like some states and cities have taken. “I can tell you that at no point has the White House Coronavirus Task Force discussed what some people call a nationwide lockdown, or as you describe a stay at home order,” Pence said. Pence also noted that the federal government sent 2,000 ventilators from the national stockpile to the state of New York, which has become the epicenter of coronavirus in the U.S., and vowed to send 2,000 more on Wednesday. PENCE SAYS 2000 VENTILATORS EN ROUTE TO NEW YORK AMID CORONAVIRUS CRISIS Pence’s comments come after the president tweeted early Tuesday saying that the government had sent just 400 ventilators to New York. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo had requested some 15,000 ventilators to deal with the outbreak in the state. Both de Blasio and Cuomo have repeatedly sounded the alarm on the shortage of ventilators in New York City hospitals, as many COVID-19 patients need the machines to help them breathe. New York now has more than 25,000 positive cases of coronavirus in the state, with roughly half of that in New York City. The president's prediction that the U.S. economy would be up-and-running by Easter, however, was tempered by comments earlier in the day by top officials at the Pentagon who predicted the COVID-19 outbreak could last anywhere from 10 weeks to three months. During a coronavirus town hall with U.S. forces around the world, Defense Secretary Mark Esper estimated it could take up to 10 weeks, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Army Gen. Mark Milley went a little further saying he expected the military to be dealing with the virus for the next three months. Trump's enthusiasm for getting people back to work also comes as he takes stock of the political toll the outbreak is taking. It sets up a potential conflict with medical professionals, including many within his government, who have called for more social restrictions to slow the spread of the virus, not fewer. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading expert on infectious diseases and a member of the White House’s coronavirus task force, told WMAL on Tuesday that Trump has always heeded his recommendations. “The president has listened to what I have said and to what the other people on the task force have said when I have made recommendations he has taken them. He's never countered or overridden me, the idea of just pitting one against the other is just not helpful,” Fauci said. During the Rose Garden interview, Trump also called on the Senate to pass a massive stimulus bill that is currently being debated between Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. The president blamed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for demanding a number of additional stipulations to the bill for the delay in its passage in the Senate. “I cancelled the deal last night because Nancy Pelosi put in a lot of things that had nothing to do with the workers,” Trump said. “They start throwing Green New Deal stuff in, and the board rooms what they will look like…They have things that are just terrible, windmills everywhere.” Arguably the most controversial aspect of the proposal, the initial GOP plan called for $208 billion in loans to larger businesses like airlines, which would have to be repaid, and a subsequent; a version released over the weekend called for $500 billion. Democrats have complained that the Republican-led draft of the aid package did not go far enough to provide health care and unemployment aid for Americans, and failed to put restraints on a proposed $500 billion ""slush fund"" for corporations, saying the ban on corporate stock buy-backs are weak and the limits on executive pay would last only two years. Schumer said Democrats also want included in the bill new collective bargaining powers for unions, higher fuel emissions standards for airlines, and expanded wind and solar tax credits. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., McConnell accused Democrats of trying to extract concessions from airlines over their ""carbon footprint,"" with the economy hanging in the balance. “They ought to be embarrassed,” he said on Monday. “This is no time for this nonsense.” CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE The nearly $2 trillion stimulus package would include direct financial help to Americans in the form of stimulus checks sent out to many Americans. The proposal would include a one-time payment of $1,200 per adult, $2,400 per couple in the U.S. and up to $3,000 for a family of four. An estimated $350 billion would be provided for small businesses to keep making payroll. Companies with 500 or fewer employees could tap up to $10 million each in forgivable small business loans to keep paychecks flowing. The program would provide 8 weeks of assistance through federally guaranteed loans qualifying employers who maintain payroll; if they do, other costs like mortgage interest, rent, and utilities would be forgiven. The bill also includes an additional $242 billion in additional emergency appropriations to fight the virus and shore up for safety net programs. That includes money for food stamps, child nutrition, hospitals, the Centers for Disease Control and public health and transportation agencies. The figure has gone significantly higher during talks over the weekend. Fox News' Brooke Singman, Lucas Tomlinson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

"                          'Fox News @ Night' anchor Shannon Bream delivers a 2020 update in 60 seconds on the biggest political stories. Former Vice President Joe Biden was a guest on ""The View"" on Tuesday, appearing live from his new television studio built in his Wilmington, Del., home. He used the appearance to once again take swipes at President Trump's coronavirus response, rejecting his suggestion that restrictions might soon be eased to restart the economy: “We’ve got to flatten that curve and we’ve got to make sure that once in fact we have this under control, it doesn’t come back.” BIDEN SAYS TRUMP NEEDS TO MOVE FASTER ON CORONAVIRUS  For the likely Democratic presidential nominee, Tuesday’s appearance on the popular daytime TV talk show marked his latest attempt to bust out of a state of suspended animation as he tries to return to the public eye in a world turned upside down by a coronavirus pandemic. But it’s been a struggle for Biden. With the Democratic primaries frozen in time – and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont still technically a candidate – Biden has yet to formally lock down the Democratic presidential nomination. And for the first time in decades, Biden is now a private citizen and outside government, with no formal role like a senator or governor in working to protect constituents on a daily basis. As Biden was sweeping major primaries one week ago in Florida, Illinois and Arizona – cementing his position as the all-but-certain nominee and all but closing Sanders’ narrow pathway to the White House – his achievements were drowned out by coronavirus coverage, as the number of infections and the death toll from the pandemic skyrocketed across the country. Biden basically disappeared from the airwaves and online at the same time that President Trump became a daily fixture at the White House briefings on the coronavirus. While the president’s sometimes controversial comments at those briefings have invited plenty of criticism, he’s the center of attention while Biden’s once high profile has been severely reduced.  BIDEN HOLDS 3-POINT EDGE OVER TRUMP IN LATEST NATIONAL POLL And Biden also has to compete for media attention with governors of some of the hardest-hit states – whose daily briefings have been receiving national attention. Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York – whose state is now the nation's epicenter of the battle against the coronavirus – has become a daily fixture on the cable news networks, and Biden has repeatedly praised his fellow Democrat. To get their candidate back on the airwaves, Biden’s campaign quickly had a television studio constructed in the former vice president’s Wilmington home. It got its first use on Monday, when Biden delivered remarks on coronavirus. “Donald Trump is not to blame for the coronavirus. But he does bear responsibility for our response,” Biden said. “This isn’t about politics. This is simply too much at stake. Too many lives.” Biden’s criticism of the president’s handling of the coronavirus was tempered compared with his comments on a conference call just three days earlier with reporters, in which he urged Trump to “stop saying false things, will you? People are worried. They are really frightened. And when these things don’t come true, you just exacerbate their concern. Stop saying false things [you] think make you sound like a hero.” But Monday’s first live appearance by Biden wasn’t carried by the major cable news networks – which instead were taking a briefing from Albany, N.Y., from Gov. Cuomo. “We were on as the same time as a public health briefing from the state of New York, which is being badly hit by this crisis,” a senior Biden campaign official noted when asked about Monday’s speech. But the official did say that the livestream was watched by 230,000 people and predicted that “you should expect to see the vice president increasing more on cable as we go forward.” The official said that the goal going forward is “to lean in a little bit and be doing something different every day. The format’s going to change but the message and the vice president is going to be the consistent thing, which is that Donald Trump has mismanaged this response to this crisis in a really severe way and continues to not respond effectively and he’s going to point that out and be clear about the steps he would be taking if he were president to address this.” The official spotlighted that “we’ve responded in real time as the president continues to make what we think are the wrong decisions” and pledged that “you’re going to continue to see him comment in real time on social through statements, on video.” THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN Trump’s reelection campaign has repeatedly fired back, accusing Biden of trying to politicize the crisis. ""By preying upon Americans’ fear amid the coronavirus outbreak, Biden isn’t just playing cheap politics. He’s making the crisis worse. It’s dangerous,” the Trump campaign’s argued. ""Biden's Monday morning quarterbacking is an effort to sow anger and division among Americans."" Biden’s team response is that with the coronavirus sweeping the nation and Americans fearful for their safety and economic well-being, their candidate “should be saying every day what he would be doing as the president and as the person in charge of the health and economic response to the crisis.” Lynda Tran, a veteran Democratic strategist and communications consultant, said that Biden’s “message has to be about the unity it will require to survive this moment: We are better than this. We can and will get through this together. That is the point of social-distancing and shelter-in-place policies. It's literally the opposite of ‘I alone can solve this.’” Tran – a veteran of the Democratic National Committee and a founding partner of the communications firm 270 Strategies – said that if she were advising the Biden team, “I would urge them to create a vehicle for Americans to hear from him on a regular basis — a series of virtual 'fireside chats' set to air at a consistent time via the various social media channels available to millions across the country and that does not rely on the news media for distribution. “At the same time, I would also have him participate in frequent national and local media interviews that enable him to remind the country and the world that the chaos and lack of preparedness we've been experiencing was not and has never been a foregone conclusion,” she added. Biden’s team says such ideas are in the works. “We’re going to be creative and think outside the box a little bit on how we can reach a lot of folks. We want to focus on building our community, like fostering connections that we would normally be doing in person but now we’re doing virtually. So that could look like a lot of different things,” a senior Biden campaign official told Fox News. “You saw us put out three videos over the weekend, all of which got a million views over 24 hours,” the official spotlighted. “You’re going to see the vice president out there more, taking questions virtually, experimenting with a virtual rope line, experimenting with a podcast.” And Biden understands the potential of virtual campaigning. “The irony is, virtual campaigning, I’ll probably reach more people than I would out there shaking hands,” he said Monday on ""The View."" “With the new technology available, I think I’ll be able to reach and make my points across as well as I could if I were out doing a big rally. “    ",         Biden struggling to break through in coronavirus crisis,         2020-03-24T141052-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/biden-struggling-to-break-through-in-coronavirus-crisis,Fox

Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., released a plan last week for what is essentially a temporary universal basic income (UBI) that would be distributed to all individuals in the United States, including illegal immigrants, and be funded by the printing of two $1 trillion coins. ""Hey @realdonaldTrump, let's provide relief from this crisis for people by giving pre-loaded debit cards to every person in America,"" Tlaib tweeted over the weekend. ""No additional debt -- we'll just mint two coins."" The plan, outlined on Tlaib's website, would send a debit card with $2,000 pre-loaded on it to every person in the U.S. and reload it with $1,000 every month ""until one year after the end of the Coronavirus crisis."" CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW TRUMP, DURING FOX NEWS CORONAVIRUS TOWNHALL, CALLS FOR RE-OPENING ECONOMY BY EASTER: 'WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO WORK' Tlaib's plan tracks closely along the lines of former presidential candidate Andrew Yang's UBI proposal that made his campaign extraordinarily popular with a niche audience. But like similar proposals to combat the coronavirus from Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, and Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, Tlaib's handout would only be temporary, in contrast to Yang's $1,000 per month permanent UBI. Tlaib would take advantage of an obscure provision in federal law that ostensibly allows the Treasury to mint commemorative coins to have the U.S. Mint make ""two $1 trillion platinum coins"" that would be purchased by the federal reserve ""at full face value."" ""This approach would preserve the historical separation between fiscal and monetary policy and avoid financial entanglement between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve which would eventually undermine the independence of the Fed,"" Tlaib's plan explains. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The idea of minting trillion-dollar coins was discussed during the Obama administration when the U.S. faced default on its debt, but was never taken very seriously.

Vice President Pence said Tuesday the federal government sent 2,000 ventilators from the national stockpile to the state of New York, which has become the epicenter of coronavirus in the U.S., and vowed to send 2,000 more on Wednesday. “I just received word, and the challenge the state of New York faces. Earlier today, FEMA, from the national stockpile, shipped 2,000 ventilators to the state of New York,” Pence said during Fox News’ virtual coronavirus town hall Tuesday. PENCE SAYS WH NOT CONSIDERING NATIONAL QUARANTINE AMID CORONAVIRUS “Tomorrow, there will be another 2,000 ventilators shipped from the national stockpile,” Pence said. “We have a ways to go yet, it’s the reason why we’re marshaling all the resources, not just from national stockpiles but from our existing supply in hospitals, and that equipment can be converted.” Pence went on to stress to “the people in New York” that the 2,000 ventilators “were sent directly” to the state. Pence’s comments come after the president tweeted early Tuesday saying that the government had sent just 400 ventilators to New York. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo had requested some 15,000 ventilators to deal with the outbreak in the state. Both de Blasio and Cuomo have repeatedly sounded the alarm on the shortage of ventilators in New York City hospitals, as many COVID-19 patients need the machines to help them breathe. New York now has more than 25,000 positive cases of coronavirus in the state, with roughly half of that in New York City. CUOMO SAYS NEW YORK MAY NEED AS MANY AS 140,000 HOSPITAL BEDS AMID COVID-19 CRISIS IN STATE To help the state grapple with the outbreak, Cuomo has also announced four sites in the state that will serve as additional space for hospitals overflowing due to the coronavirus outbreak. “We projected an apex at 100,000 hospital beds needed,” Cuomo said Tuesday. “The new projection suggests as high as 140,000 hospital beds will be needed.” Cuomo said that the coronavirus curve in the state hasn’t been “flattened” and instead “is actually increasing,” saying the peak of the virus in the state is likely to hit New York in 14 to 21 days. “New York is the canary in the coal mine,” Cuomo said. “New York is going first. We have the fastest and highest rate of infection. What’s happening in New York is going to happen in California, Washington Illinois, it’s just a matter of time.” Cuomo said that once New York has stifled the rate of infection and spread of the virus, it would be able to help other states not yet hit by the illness. Cuomo also vowed to explore every option to expand hospital capacity, including dorms and hotels. “I will turn the state upside down to get the number of beds we need,” he said. COVID-19 was designated a pandemic by the World Health Organization earlier this month. The president declared a national emergency, and governors across the nation have issued executive orders urging residents to stay at home. As of midday Tuesday, the U.S. had at least 46,800 cases in US positive cases of COVID-19. The virus has claimed nearly 600 lives in the U.S. Fox News' Alex Hein contributed to this report.     ",         Pence says thousands of ventilators en route to New York amid coronavirus crisis,         2020-03-24T131935-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/white-house-sent-2000-ventilators-to-ny-will-sent-2000-more-this-week-pence-says,Fox

Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., are demanding China fork over money to nations afflicted with the novel coronavirus, arguing the Chinese Communist Party must pay for its ""lies"" about the early outbreak of the virus. The pair of GOP lawmakers introduced a bicameral resolution Tuesday calling for an international investigation to quantify the harm caused by the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) cover-up of the early spread of the coronavirus pandemic. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW The resolution also calls for the international community to design a mechanism to deliver compensation to the United States and other nations gravely hurt by China's initial decision to hide the emergence of COVID-19. “Since day one, the Chinese Communist Party intentionally lied to the world about the origin of this pandemic,"" Hawley said in a statement. ""The CCP was aware of the reality of the virus as early as December but ordered laboratories to destroy samples and forced doctors to keep silent. It is time for an international investigation into the role their cover-up played in the spread of this devastating pandemic. The CCP must be held to account for what the world is now suffering.” Their resolution's wording condemns the Chinese government for recently arguing that COVID–19 did not originate in China and for alleging ""that the United States Army may have delivered COVID–19 to the city of Wuhan.""Stefanik said there's no doubt China ""knowingly withheld critical information needed to combat the spread of the Chinese-born COVID-19 and to this day continues to spread lies and disinformation on the origin of the deadly virus."" Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have been going after China. Earlier Tuesday, Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., introduced a bipartisan resolution to condemn the Chinese government over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak, painting a stark picture of lies and mismanagement contributing to the pandemic that has infected nearly 390,000 people worldwide and killed more than 16,700. BIPARTISAN HOUSE RESOLUTION CONDEMNS CHINESE GOVERNMENT OVER HANDLING OF CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE This resolution comes as tensions between the U.S. and China are running high over the Chinese government's high-powered propaganda campaign seeking to paint itself as the global coronavirus savior while several U.S. officials and politicians, including President Trump, have taken to calling the coronavirus the ""Chinese virus"" in reference to its origins in Wuhan, a city in China.

In a Fox News virtual town hall Tuesday, President Trump expressed concern that the U.S. could see an uptick in suicides should the coordinated economic slowdown aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus continue, citing Americans' desire to get back to work. These comments continue a recent pattern of Trump itching to get the U.S. economy back on track following a stock market crash that erased about one-third of the value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in just a matter of weeks. ""You're going to lose a number of people to the flu, but you're going to lose more people by putting a country into a massive recession or depression,"" Trump said Tuesday. ""You're gonna lose people. You're gonna have suicides by the thousands."" CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW TRUMP SIGNALS DESIRE TO END LOCKDOWNS: 'OUR PEOPLE WANT TO RETURN TO WORK' Trump continued: ""You're gonna have all sorts of things happen. You're gonna have instability. You can't just come in and say let's close up the United States of America, the biggest most successful country in the world by far."" This reflected a comment from Trump Monday night signaling he was hopeful the United States could get back to business as usual sooner rather than later. ""We can’t have the cure be worse than the problem,"" he said at a White House briefing. He repeated the line in his Tuesday town hall. But many models have shown that the coronavirus pandemic could last months in the United States, and Trump himself previously predicted that the coronavirus threat would last until July or August. Tuesday he said he hoped the U.S. could largely get back to normal by Easter Sunday. Later in his town hall, Trump addressed concerns that rushing back to normalcy might worsen the coronavirus crisis. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""We can do much of what we're doing and we can do it from a work environment instead of an environment where everybody's locked up and everybody is saying, 'Oh, the business is gone, the business is gone,' and everybody's suffering depression,"" Trump said, referencing social distancing guidelines. ""And that causes death and that causes a lot of problems. These are people, they want to save their business they don't want to be locked up in some room or some apartment or house and in the meantime, their restaurant's closed, their business is closed... I believe very strongly you're going to lose far more people by going that way than you are if we kept this thing going."" Trump and the White House have encouraged Americans to engage in ""social distancing"" and to stay at home to reduce the transmission of the coronavirus.

President Trump said Tuesday during a Fox News virtual townhall that he wants the country’s economy re-opened by Easter amid questions over how long people should stay home and businesses should remain closed to slow the spread of coronavirus. Speaking from the Rose Garden alongside others on his coronavirus taskforce, Trump said he ""would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter."" The holiday this year lands on April 12. Trump argued he doesn’t want “to turn the country off” and see a continued economic downfall from the pandemic. He also said he worries the U.S. will see ""suicides by the thousands"" if coronavirus devastates the economy. PENCE SAYS WHITE HOUSE NOT CONSIDERING A NATIONWIDE CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWN ""We lose thousands and thousands of people a year to the flu. We don't turn the country off,” Trump said during the interview. Trump added: “We lose much more than that to automobile accidents. We don't call up the automobile companies and say stop making cars. We have to get back to work.” Taking questions before Trump, Vice President Mike Pence said the administration is not considering a nationwide coronavirus lockdown like some states and cities have taken. “I can tell you that at no point has the White House Coronavirus Task Force discussed what some people call a nationwide lockdown, or as you describe a stay at home order,” Pence said. Pence also noted that the federal government sent 2,000 ventilators from the national stockpile to the state of New York, which has become the epicenter of coronavirus in the U.S., and vowed to send 2,000 more on Wednesday. PENCE SAYS 2000 VENTILATORS EN ROUTE TO NEW YORK AMID CORONAVIRUS CRISIS Pence’s comments come after the president tweeted early Tuesday saying that the government had sent just 400 ventilators to New York. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo had requested some 15,000 ventilators to deal with the outbreak in the state. Both de Blasio and Cuomo have repeatedly sounded the alarm on the shortage of ventilators in New York City hospitals, as many COVID-19 patients need the machines to help them breathe. New York now has more than 25,000 positive cases of coronavirus in the state, with roughly half of that in New York City. The president's prediction that the U.S. economy would be up-and-running by Easter, however, was tempered by comments earlier in the day by top officials at the Pentagon who predicted the COVID-19 outbreak could last anywhere from 10 weeks to three months. During a coronavirus town hall with U.S. forces around the world, Defense Secretary Mark Esper estimated it could take up to 10 weeks, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Army Gen. Mark Milley went a little further saying he expected the military to be dealing with the virus for the next three months. Trump's enthusiasm for getting people back to work also comes as he takes stock of the political toll the outbreak is taking. It sets up a potential conflict with medical professionals, including many within his government, who have called for more social restrictions to slow the spread of the virus, not fewer. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading expert on infectious diseases and a member of the White House’s coronavirus task force, told WMAL on Tuesday that Trump has always heeded his recommendations. “The president has listened to what I have said and to what the other people on the task force have said when I have made recommendations he has taken them. He's never countered or overridden me, the idea of just pitting one against the other is just not helpful,” Fauci said. During the Rose Garden interview, Trump also called on the Senate to pass a massive stimulus bill that is currently being debated between Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. The president blamed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for demanding a number of additional stipulations to the bill for the delay in its passage in the Senate. “I cancelled the deal last night because Nancy Pelosi put in a lot of things that had nothing to do with the workers,” Trump said. “They start throwing Green New Deal stuff in, and the board rooms what they will look like…They have things that are just terrible, windmills everywhere.” Arguably the most controversial aspect of the proposal, the initial GOP plan called for $208 billion in loans to larger businesses like airlines, which would have to be repaid, and a subsequent; a version released over the weekend called for $500 billion. Democrats have complained that the Republican-led draft of the aid package did not go far enough to provide health care and unemployment aid for Americans, and failed to put restraints on a proposed $500 billion ""slush fund"" for corporations, saying the ban on corporate stock buy-backs are weak and the limits on executive pay would last only two years. Schumer said Democrats also want included in the bill new collective bargaining powers for unions, higher fuel emissions standards for airlines, and expanded wind and solar tax credits. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., McConnell accused Democrats of trying to extract concessions from airlines over their ""carbon footprint,"" with the economy hanging in the balance. “They ought to be embarrassed,” he said on Monday. “This is no time for this nonsense.” CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE The nearly $2 trillion stimulus package would include direct financial help to Americans in the form of stimulus checks sent out to many Americans. The proposal would include a one-time payment of $1,200 per adult, $2,400 per couple in the U.S. and up to $3,000 for a family of four. An estimated $350 billion would be provided for small businesses to keep making payroll. Companies with 500 or fewer employees could tap up to $10 million each in forgivable small business loans to keep paychecks flowing. The program would provide 8 weeks of assistance through federally guaranteed loans qualifying employers who maintain payroll; if they do, other costs like mortgage interest, rent, and utilities would be forgiven. The bill also includes an additional $242 billion in additional emergency appropriations to fight the virus and shore up for safety net programs. That includes money for food stamps, child nutrition, hospitals, the Centers for Disease Control and public health and transportation agencies. The figure has gone significantly higher during talks over the weekend. Fox News' Brooke Singman, Lucas Tomlinson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Mark Meadows and five other members of Congress are in self-quarantine but have not tested positive for coronavirus; Kristin Fisher reports. Rep. Mark Meadows said Tuesday he plans to resign from Congress “toward the end of the month” to take on his new post as President Trump’s acting White House chief of staff. Meadows, R-N.C., on Tuesday told reporters he was still a member of Congress and had not yet officially taken on his new duties. TRUMP TAPS MEADOWS AS WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF “I’m still a member of Congress,” Meadows said. “I’ll end up resigning as a member of Congress. That [...] happens toward the end of the month.” Still, Meadows arrived on Capitol Hill Tuesday with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and apparently was part of the negotiations between the White House and lawmakers over phase three of the coronavirus stimulus package. “We’re very close. Mark Meadows and I are here,” Mnuchin said. “We’ve spoken to the president two times this morning and we’re ready to close a deal today.” Trump tapped Meadows as chief of staff earlier this month, after weeks of rumors that he would do so. “I am pleased to announce that Congressman Mark Meadows will become White House Chief of Staff. I have long known and worked with Mark, and the relationship is a very good one,” Trump tweeted March 6. Meadows, 60, had announced in December 2019 that he planned to leave Congress at the end of his current term. He has represented North Carolina's 11th Congressional District since 2013. He also chaired the House Freedom Caucus from 2017 until earlier this year, when he was succeeded by Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz. Meadows has been one of Trump’s most loyal defenders on Capitol Hill, particularly during the Russia investigation and the monthlong impeachment battle that ended with an acquittal last month. Meadows is taking over for Mick Mulvaney, who has been the acting White House chief of staff since January 2019, replacing Gen. John Kelly. Mulvaney was also serving as director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Mulvaney, Trump said, will become the U.S. special envoy for Northern Ireland.

The super PAC, Priorities USA, will utilize Facebook ads in addition to multiple on television that highlight the coronavirus' spread under Trump's leadership. Ads will focus on voters in four key battleground states -- Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania -- and contrast Trump with former Vice President Joe Biden, his likely competitor in the 2020 presidential election. Priorities USA Chairman Guy Cecil, who previously worked for Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign, asserted that Trump's ""failure to lead"" created ""life and death consequences."" FORMER WARREN, CLINTON AIDES LEADING 'CORONAVIRUS WAR ROOM' TARGETING TRUMP'S RESPONSE TO PANDEMIC “From the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, Donald Trump has repeatedly misled the American people and exposed us to unnecessary danger. His failure to lead continues to have real life and death consequences as hospitals, local and state governments, small businesses, and millions of Americans are left without the tools and information they need,” Cecil said in a press release. Cecil's ad was just the latest in a series from Democrat-aligned groups who sought to target Trump's coronavirus response. A PAC tied to former Obama aide David Plouffe is also planning to spend millions in attack ads targeting several key swing states. One of Priorities USA's ads, tweeted on Monday, is almost identical to another mysterious ad that surfaced on Twitter last week. ""Fellow Americans,"" a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, ran the ad but it's unclear where the group originated. Its website is sparse and vaguely refers to opposing political division in the United States. Both ads splice together Trump's statements while displaying a chart that shows the increasing number of coronavirus cases in the United States. LATEST ANTI-TRUMP AD PASSES TWITTER SCRUTINY AS DARK MONEY TARGETS PANDEMIC RESPONSE Americans for Public Trust, an outside group led by former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt, a Republican, raised concerns last week about the networks behind the pandemic-related attacks on the president. The group is claiming that similar anti-Trump messaging is coming from a series of organizations tied to Arabella Advisors -- a dark money nonprofit providing help to liberal groups. Specifically, it houses the New Venture Fund and Sixteen Thirty Fund, both of which have supported another Democrat-aligned group -- American Bridge -- that's hitting Trump on the coronavirus response. The New Venture Fund has also supported Pacronym, the group affiliated with a nonprofit led by Plouffe. Protect our Care, which has been described as a project of the Sixteen Thirty Fund, has also been running an ad against Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., reportedly tying his opposition to ObamaCare to the coronavirus. On Thursday, Protect Our Care announced a ""coronavirus war room"" staffed with former aides to Hillary Clinton's and Elizabeth Warren's campaigns. PAC TIED TO EX-OBAMA AIDE SET TO HAMMER TRUMP OVER CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE Priorities USA has received funding from liberal billionaire George Soros and was formed by former Obama campaign officials. Tim Murtaugh, communications director for the Trump campaign, blasted the group's ad in a statement to Fox News. “It used to be that Americans faced national adversity with unity, but Joe Biden and his allies have abandoned that principle in favor of rank, despicable politics. They offer nothing but partisan sniping from the sidelines and seek to undermine the federal response to the crisis by misinforming and frightening people,"" he said. He continued: ""The ad also contains the already disproven lie that President Trump called the virus a ‘hoax,’ when in fact he was referring to Democrat and media criticisms of the federal response as ‘their new hoax.’ All Joe Biden knows about handling a public health crisis is that the Obama White House had to apologize for his irresponsible remarks during the swine flu outbreak in 2009. Americans can see that President Trump is out front and leading this nation and is the clear choice to see us through the crisis."" CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW Fox News previously reported on how multiple media outlets similarly omitted context surrounding Trump's comments to a rally audience in February. The ad splices several statements from Trump, playing them against the backdrop of a chart showing the escalation of coronavirus cases in the U.S. One of those quotes includes Trump's ""hoax"" comment but does so by combining two separate statements and not providing the words Trump said before he used the ""hoax"" label. ""The coronavirus, this is their new hoax,"" the ad says. According to The Washington Post, Trump never made that exact statement but it was included in another ad released by former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign. Fox News confirmed last week that Twitter declined to flag the ""Fellow Americans"" ad, which also contains that phrase.

Saying the country was nearing the ""the end of our historic battle"" with ""the invisible enemy"" of coronavirus, President Trump on Tuesday evening emphasized his desire for the U.S. to reopen for business by Easter -- as his top economic adviser said Congress is ""getting closer and closer"" to passing an unprecedented fiscal stimulus package. Speaking at Tuesday's White House coronavirus task force briefing, Director of the U.S. National Economic Council Larry Kudlow specifically said the new coronavirus bill working its way through congressional gridlock would total $6 trillion: $4 trillion in liquidity from the Federal Reserve and $2 trillion in new money. Typical annual appropriations from Congress in a given fiscal year are around $1.2-4 trillion, with total expenditures roughly $4.3 trillion. ""I said earlier today that I hope we can do this by Easter,"" Trump said in the White House briefing room, referring to his comments at a Fox News virtual town hall that officials could soon ease social-distancing restrictions. ""I think that would be a great thing for our country, and we're all working very hard to make that a reality. ... Easter is a very special day for many reasons."" Trump also sounded an unexpectedly magnanimous note: ""I also want to thank Congress, because whether or not we're happy that they haven't quite gotten there yet, they have been working long hours. I'm talking Republicans and Democrats, all of them, the House, the Senate. I want to thank Congress because they are really trying to get there, and I think they will."" DEMS FUME AS TRUMP SAYS COUNTRY MAY BE REOPENED BY EASTER “This package will be the single largest Main Street assistance program in the history of the United States,” Kudlow said, adding that negotiations would continue into the evening but that a vote is imminent. However, although the temperature on Capitol Hill was much lower on Tuesday, some fireworks began on the Senate floor late Tuesday night, after the briefing. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., remarked that “there are too many people on the field"" and that Democrats still wanted too much more money for non-emergency, unrelated policy projects. ""Every special interest group in town is trying to get a little bit more,"" Graham said. ""Nickel-and-diming at a time when people are dying -- literally dying."" He urged Trump to recall Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to the White House to end negotiations. ""We may be on the 1-yard-line,"" Graham added around 8:30 p.m. ET, referring to some lawmakers' claims that the conclusion of negotiations was within reach. ""But, apparently there are 20 people on defense.""

Pence said the Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA] was providing 7.6 million N95 masks and 4 million surgical masks to states. The agency told Fox News that at the last minute, it was able to procure coronavirus test kits from the private market and did not need to invoke the “prioritization” clause of the Defense Production Act. ""We should never be reliant on a foreign country for the means of our own survival,"" Trump said, adding that coronavirus has shown ""how critical it is to have strong borders and a robust manufacturing sector."" ""This package will be the single largest Main Street assistance program in the history of the United States."" As his approval numbers hit their highest point ever, with 60 percent of Americans approving of his coronavirus response efforts, Trump went on to tout the impact of the expected congressional stimulus package as a good sign for the nation's financial future. ""The Dow surged over 2,100 points,"" Trump said. ""That's the all-time record in the history of the exchange."" Investors had released some frustration that had pent up over days of watching Democrats repeatedly block GOP stimulus efforts.

As the briefing concluded, White House press Secretary Stephanie Grisham, who has been quarantined since coming in contact with Brazilian officials almost two weeks ago and working from home, revealed she has received negative COVID-19 test results and will be back to work Wednesday. Grisham will return as the Trump administration increasingly has sought to project optimism. The president, who tweeted Sunday that ""WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF,"" declared at the Fox News virtual town hall that he ""would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter."" Pressed by Fox News' John Roberts on the timeline, Trump said at the briefing: ""We'll be looking at a lot of things -- we'll also be looking at very large portions of our country, but I'll be guided very much by Dr. [Anthony] Fauci, and by Deborah [Birx]."" Fauci, the longtime head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, whose absence from recent coronavirus briefings triggered a wave of speculation in the media, said the timeline was still ""flexible."" This past Sunday, Fauci rejected attempts by journalists to drive a wedge between himself and the president. ""The president was trying to bring hope to the people. I think there's this issue of [the media] trying to separate the two of us. There isn't fundamentally a difference there,"" Fauci said. On Sunday, Fauci elaborated in a radio interview, saying media efforts to create a rift were ""unfortunate."" ""I would wish that would stop because we have a much bigger problem here than trying to point out differences,"" Fauci said. ""They're really fundamentally at the core when you look at things, they are not differences.""

Top Democrats are deriding President Trump's suggestion that he'd like to see the U.S. economy reopened soon, as the White House weighs how to refine nationwide social-distancing guidelines to put some workers back on the job amid the coronavirus pandemic. The president, who tweeted Sunday that ""WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF,"" declared at a Fox News virtual town hall on Tuesday that he ""would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter."" The holiday this year lands on April 12. The president's push prompted immediate backlash. ""It's incredible that this has to be said: Letting thousands of people needlessly suffer and die is wrong,"" Hillary Clinton tweeted. ""It's also not a recipe for rescuing the economy."" The failed 2008 and 2016 Democratic presidential candidate added: ""Please do not take medical advice from a man who looked directly at a solar eclipse."" TRUMP, AT FOX NEWS TOWN HALL, SAYS HE'D LIKE TO SEE AMERICA REOPENED BY EASTER And, in an interview on ABC's ""The View,"" Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden remarked: ""We have to take care of the cure, that will make the problem worse no matter what."" It was unclear what the former vice president meant, but he went on to take a clear shot at Trump for spreading ""assertions not based on hard science."" Biden, for his part, has made numerous claims about the Trump administration's coronavirus response that have been assessed as false by several fact-checkers. “I don’t agree with the notion that somehow it’s okay to let the, uh, let people die, and I’m not sure that would happen ... because, to make sure the economy's there for our kids,"" Biden has said. ""The whole world is suffering from this."" Speaking to CNN's Jake Tapper on Tuesday afternoon, Biden called Trump a ""piece of work"" and asked, ""What is going on with this man?"" JOHNS HOPKINS FOUND U.S. BEST PREPARED COUNTRY IN THE WORLD TO HANDLE PANDEMIC, AS TRUMP TEAM HITS BIDEN FOR FALSE CLAIMS ""He should stop talking and start to listen to the medical experts who talk about having an economic crisis,"" Biden said.

(Separately, Tapper instructed Biden on how to properly cough into his elbow.) Others were more blunt. ""This a--hole and his rich friends are too stupid to get that we can only get through this together,"" wrote former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau. ""Everyone is at risk from the virus. Everyone suffers when there aren’t enough hospital beds. Everyone struggles when millions are too sick to work."" Fellow Obama communications alum Tommy Vietor, meanwhile, deleted a tweet lamenting that he was reduced to drinking red wine in the shower during the economic shutdown. Reluctance toward reopening the economy was not limited to Democrats, however. Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., who serves as House Republican Conference Chair, urged caution on Tuesday, although she didn't explicitly address Trump's comments. ""There will be no normally functioning economy if our hospitals are overwhelmed and thousands of Americans of all ages, including our doctors and nurses, lay dying because we have failed to do what’s necessary to stop the virus,"" Cheney wrote. Indeed, health experts have made clear that unless Americans continue to dramatically limit social interaction -- staying home from work and isolating themselves -- the number of infections will overwhelm the health care system, as it has in parts of Italy, leading to many more deaths. While the worst outbreaks are concentrated in certain parts of the country, such as New York, experts warn that the highly infectious disease is certain to spread. The U.S. is now more than a week into an unprecedented 15-day effort to encourage all Americans to drastically scale back their public activities -- an initiative that has devastated the stock market and lead to soaring unemployment. The guidelines, issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are voluntary, but many state and local leaders have issued mandatory restrictions in line with, or even tighter than, those issued by the CDC. On Monday, the U.S. saw its biggest jump yet in the death toll due to the virus, with 609 American deaths attributed to COVID-19 since the outbreak began. Trump's comments come after dire warnings by officials in hard-hit areas, including New York. Gov. Andrew Cuomo warned Tuesday that his state's hospital capacity will soon hit a breaking point, even with the restrictions already in place.

He argued that tens of thousands of Americans die from the seasonal flu or in automobile accidents and “we don't turn the country off.” “We'll assess at that time and we'll give it some more time if we need a little more time, but we need to open this country up,"" he added. “We have to go back to work, much sooner than people thought.” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading expert on infectious diseases and a member of the White House’s coronavirus task force, did not appear at the virtual town hall, but Trump denied there were any tensions between the two men.

He's never countered or overridden me, the idea of just pitting one against the other is just not helpful,” Fauci said. Meanwhile, Larry Kudlow, Trump’s top economic adviser, told reporters Tuesday that “public health includes economic health.""

"                          'Fox News @ Night' anchor Shannon Bream delivers a 2020 update in 60 seconds on the biggest political stories. Former Vice President Joe Biden said he’s aiming to start vetting potential running mates next month – and that he will likely start with a list of around 11 potential candidates. The all-but-certain Democratic presidential nominee – in an appearance Tuesday on ""The View"" – said, “There's about 12 to 15 women who I think would be qualified to be president tomorrow, but I think we're going to narrow the list down to about 11.” BIDEN COULD CONSIDER THESE FEMALE DEMOCRATS AS HIS RUNNING MATE  Biden pledged at a Democratic primary debate a week and a half ago to name a female vice presidential nominee. ""The lawyers are putting together what will be the nature of the vetting process. It's got to be thorough, which it would be, and we're looking at when to start sooner than later,” Biden shared. Biden added, “I just need to make sure whomever I pick … that that person is simpatico with where I want to take the nation in terms of domestic and foreign policy and I think there are a number of women who are in the category.” And he confirmed that he’s had a conversation with his onetime boss former President Barack Obama about the vetting process. After clinching the Democratic nomination in 2008, Obama named then-Sen. Biden of Delaware, a former primary rival, as his running mate. In an interview with CNN later on Tuesday, Biden added that he hopes to start the vetting process sometime in April and that he had not had any conversations to date with any of the potential contenders. Don't cancel the party -- yet The presumptive Democratic nominee – as of now – wants this summer’s Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wis., to go on as planned. Asked in the CNN interview if the convention should be called off because of the coronavirus pandemic, Biden responded, “I don’t think so. I think we order be able to conduct our democratic processes as well as deal with this issue.” “We can't let the democratic process be interrupted by the process of dealing with this virus. We can do both,” he emphasized. CORONAVIRUS THREATENS THIS SUMMER’S POLITICAL CONVENTIONS But Biden added that any decision to call off or alter the national nominating convention will made depending on “the state of the nation at the moment” and “on the circumstance that exists” closer to the summer. Democratic National Committee officials told Fox News last week that they were moving ahead with planning but that “this is obviously a fluid situation.” The Democratic convention is scheduled for July 13-16. The Republican National Convention is scheduled to be held Aug. 24-27 in Charlotte, N.C. On the other line Biden said on Tuesday that he hasn’t talked directly with nomination rival Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. “I have not has any personal conversations with him. My staff and his staff have had discussions.” One week ago the former vice president swept primaries in Florida, Illinois and Arizona, cementing his position as the all-but-certain nominee and all but closing Sanders’ narrow pathway to the White House. Sanders is now reassessing his campaign. “It’s not for me to tell him to drop out. They can make that judgement for themselves. It’s up to Bernie to what he wants to do,” Biden explained. But making a pitch for the support of Sanders and his legions of young and progressive voters, Biden needs to unify the party and emphasized that “I hope at the end of the day no matter what happens we’re all together. That we don’t have a little bit of what we had last time, where some people stayed home. Bernie and I have always gotten along real well. I have nothing but respect for him….I hear what some of his supporters are saying and I’m prepared to and I’ve moved on some of it.” While he hasn’t chatted with Sanders, Biden said he has talked with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who ended her White House bid earlier this month. “I’ve been talking with Elizabeth Warren, who is as you know bright as can be and committed. I’ve adopted some of the things that she suggested, the new bankruptcy bill that she has, which is the way to fix the problems were broken,” Biden said on ABC's ""The View."" BIDEN STRUGGLES TO INCREASE HIS MEDIA PROFILE DURING CORONAVIRUS CRISIS  Two weeks ago Biden embraced the progressive senator’s signature proposal to reform bankruptcy rules, bringing to an end a decade and a half old feud between the two over the issue. Easter egg-scuse me! Biden strongly disagrees with President Trump’s call to restart the economy by Easter by easing stay-at-home restrictions now in place in many states from coast to coast. TRUMP CALLS FOR RESTARTING ECONOMY BY EASTER During a Fox News virtual town hall on Tuesday, the president said that he wants the country’s economy re-opened by Easter amid questions over how long people should stay home and businesses should remain closed to slow the spread of coronavirus. Speaking from the Rose Garden alongside others on his coronavirus task force, Trump said he ""would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter."" The holiday this year lands on April 12. “We have to get back to work,” Trump stressed. Trump’s push comes as the death toll and number of people infected by the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S. has surged over the past week. More than half the nation’s population is now under shelter-at-home orders mandated by states. “He should stop talking and start to listen to the medical experts,” Biden emphasized in his CNN interview. “Watch this spike. Watch the number of dead go up,” he warned. And on ""The View"" Biden urged, “We’ve got to flatten that curve and we’ve got to make sure that once in fact we have this under control, it doesn’t come back,” and said as he disagrees with a suggestion from President Trump to restart the economy by easing stay at home restrictions imposed to combat the coronavirus pandemic. “Now we’re catching up and I think it’s important to continue the road we’re on,” he stressed. It's tight A new national poll points to an extremely close contest between President Trump and Biden as the race for the White House shifts to a likely general election battle between the two. Biden stands at 48 percent support among registered voters nationwide in a Monmouth University poll, with the GOP incumbent at 45 percent. Biden’s slight 3-point edge over Trump is within the poll’s sampling error, meaning the race is roughly tied between the two candidates. Read the full story here.

"                          Lindsey Graham speaks about the coronavirus relief bill from the Senate floor. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. The White House and Senate leaders reached a breakthrough deal shortly after midnight Wednesday on a massive and historic $2 trillion coronavirus relief package for workers and businesses, Fox News has confirmed, capping off days of heated negotiations that had nearly been derailed by last-minute demands from House Democrats. “Ladies and gentleman, we are done,"" White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland announced as he left the office of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., near midnight. ""We have a deal."" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the bill amounts to “unemployment compensation on steroids,"" and that every American laid off will have their missed salary remunerated. The bombshell provision will enable companies to stay afloat and immediately bring back those employees when things are safe‬, Schumer said. McConnell said the Senate will meet at 12:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday, but did not set a time for a vote. By rule, the procedural vote to begin debate on the coronavirus package would happen at 1 p.m. ET, unless the Senate scraps that vote‬. Ueland told reporters that ""much of the work on bill text has been completed and I’m hopeful over the next few hours we’ll finish what's left and we will circulate it early in the morning.” Concerning any outstanding issues, he said ""we have either clear, explicit legislative text, reflecting all parties, or we know exactly where we're going to land without a legislative text, as we continue to finish.” The unprecedented economic rescue package would give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home.       Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, left, accompanied by White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland and acting White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, speaks with reporters as he walks to the offices of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky. on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, March 24, 2020. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)       One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines, given that Democrats wanted them to abide by new carbon emissions restrictions. Hospitals would get significant help as well. The deal came hours after President Trump's top economic adviser said an unprecedented $6 trillion stimulus plan was imminent, including $4 trillion in liquidity from the Federal Reserve and $2 trillion in new money from Congress. Tensions then abruptly ratcheted back up again on Capitol Hill Tuesday night -- with Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham and Steve Daines taking to the Senate floor and calling for an end to negotiations because, as Graham put it, Democrats were ""nickel-and-diming at a time when people are dying -- literally dying."" Graham and Daines' late-night push for an immediate vote on a stimulus bill came after tensions seemingly had cooled in Congress during the day, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its highest point gain in its history as leaders from both parties signaled that an agreement could be within reach. Shares advanced in Asia on Wednesday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged to its best day since 1933 as Congress and the White House neared a deal. Japan's Nikkei 225 index jumped 5.3 percent, while Hong Kong added 3 percent and Sydney climbed 3.6 percent. Markets across Asia were all up more than 2 percent. ""Ladies and gentleman, we are done. We have a deal."" But, the Republicans said late Tuesday, Democrats were still seeking new payouts that were delaying a vote on a final bill. ""In case you're watching,"" Graham said in reference to the president, his voice rising, ""tell [Treasury Secretary] Steven Mnuchin to come back to the White House and end negotiations. I think I understand the give-and-take of life and politics, but I've been called by two good friends on the Democratic side in the last five or six hours wanting more money. End the negotiations."" He added: ""This bill is $2 trillion. There's a ton of money in this bill for people who need it, but what we're doing now is, every special-interest group in town is trying to get a little bit more."" “Listen, we were told we are at the one-yard line last night to get this done,"" Daines, who led the colloquy with Graham, said from the Senate floor. ""All I’ve got to say is, the Senate may think it’s at the one-yard line right now, but Montanans are getting sacked. In fact, our unemployment claims in Montana since march 17th, we just looked it up 15 minutes ago, 14,350 Montanans have filed for unemployment in the last week.” Monday had been marked with furious debate on the Senate floor, as Republicans accused House Democrats of proposing an alternative stimulus bill that was full of unnecessary progressive wishlist items. Senate Democrats in the meantime repeatedly blocked the Republican stimulus bill, which would require 60 votes to survive. WATCH DAINES' FULL SPEECH ON THE SENATE FLOOR The bill offered by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., included measures to restrict airlines' carbon emissions, protect illegal immigrants, provide for same-day voter registration, pay off billions in student loan debt, encourage federal agencies to employ ""minority banks,"" bail out the U.S. Postal Service and even fund the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. ""There is a whole concern in our country that if we're giving tens of billions of dollars to the airlines, that we could at least have a shared value about what happens to the environment,"" Pelosi said Tuesday. Republicans, including the president, have called the measures irrelevant ""nonsense"" and total nonstarters. After Democrats signaled they might be willing to negotiate away some of their proposals, though, the Dow surged and lawmakers appeared optimistic. Democrats have argued the GOP package would do too much for large corporations and not enough for workers, and inaccurately suggested that the treasury secretary would have unilateral control over a massive ""slush fund."" ""This is ridiculous,"" Graham continued Tuesday night. ""Steven Mnuchin has done a good job. I appreciate his efforts to negotiate a bill that will help America. Senator [Mitch] McConnell says we're on the two-yard line. I believe the problem is that there are 20 people playing defense, and we need to take some people off the field. What bothers me is that at that late hour, I'm still getting calls from people wanting more money."" WHAT'S IN PELOSI'S CORONAVIRUS BILL? ARTS FUNDING, CLIMATE CHANGE WISHLIST, AND MORE ""I have lost my patience with the political process,"" Graham added. ""We're being nickel-and-dimed now. The big stuff we've got pretty well right, and if it's not perfect, we can fix it later. But, we need to vote tonight, and the reason I'm on the floor is because I've been called by two Democratic colleagues in the last five or six hours wanting more money. The store is closed. Mr. President, end negotiations. Require us to vote. Draft the bill, do it tonight.""       President Trump with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, during a briefing at the White House on Tuesday. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)       Graham and Daines' frustration was matched by many of his colleagues. Louisiana GOP Sen. John Kennedy told Fox News' Sean Hannity late Tuesday that while the coronavirus ""can kill you,"" so can ""hunger."" He charged Pelosi had demolished a Senate compromise bill with her own legislation. Barring anything else, the Senate has a lingering cloture petition which will automatically ripen for a vote, by rule, one hour after the Senate meets Wednesday. That is a third procedural vote to actually start debate on the bill. They would need 60 votes. But, it’s likely that vote is postponed or thrown out if there is an agreement. The Senate would probably skip directly to the vote to pass the bill or some other arrangement. Sources are indicating to Fox News that after a Wednesday vote in the Senate, there will be a Thursday or Friday vote in the House. That process might involve a voice vote with a skeleton crew, essentially requiring unanimous consent -- meaning just one House member could kill the vote. WATCH: TRUMP SAYS CORONAVIRUS SHUTDOWN MAY BE OVER BY EASTER Shortly before Graham spoke, Trump declared at a coronovirus task force briefing that the country was nearing ""the end of our historic battle"" with ""the invisible enemy"" of coronavirus. Trump's approval numbers hit their highest point ever this week, with 60 percent of Americans approving of his coronavirus response efforts. The president also sounded an unexpectedly magnanimous note: ""I also want to thank Congress, because whether or not we're happy that they haven't quite gotten there yet, they have been working long hours. I'm talking Republicans and Democrats, all of them, the House, the Senate. I want to thank Congress because they are really trying to get there, and I think they will."" DEMS FUME AS TRUMP SAYS COUNTRY MAY BE REOPENED BY EASTER Then, Director of the U.S. National Economic Council Larry Kudlow specifically said the new coronavirus bill working its way through congressional gridlock would total $6 trillion: $4 trillion in liquidity from the Federal Reserve and $2 trillion in new money. Typical annual appropriations from Congress in a given fiscal year are around $1.2-4 trillion, with total expenditures roughly $4.3 trillion. “This package will be the single largest Main Street assistance program in the history of the United States,” Kudlow said, adding that negotiations would continue into the evening but that a vote was imminent. Meanwhile, there was some good news inside the White House grounds. As the briefing concluded, White House press Secretary Stephanie Grisham, who has been quarantined since coming in contact with Brazilian officials almost two weeks ago and working from home, revealed she has received negative COVID-19 test results and will be back to work Wednesday. Grisham will return as the Trump administration increasingly has sought to project optimism.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar on Tuesday night suggested what she admitted may be a “radical idea” to help fight the coronavirus outbreak. “All private hospitals should be made public for the duration of the virus,” the Minnesota Democrat wrote on Twitter. She said a government takeover could help address “some of the pressures our healthcare system is facing.” ILHAN OMAR SLAMMED FOR RESPONSE TO IVANKA TRUMP'S 'FAMILY TOGETHER' TWEET Omar offered no specifics on how the takeover of private property would be achieved, but critics on social media quickly reacted that Omar’s plan sounded like communism. “Here is another radical idea,” one Twitter commenter wrote. “Let’s admit that communism doesn’t work and that it caused the #ChineseVirus.” “So you can run them in to the ground?” another wrote. “Spoken like a true Castroite,” a third commented. Omar has given her presidential endorsement to Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist from Vermont who has drawn criticism for past statements in support of the late Fidel Castro’s communist regime in Cuba, as well as Daniel Ortega’s socialist rule in Nicaragua. Both Sanders and Omar have spoken in support relieving student debt and providing Medicare for All, proposals that critics have derided as giveaways for which taxpayers would foot the bill. At Sanders campaign rallies, Omar has called for a ""mass movement of the working class"" to defeat President Trump and ""Western imperialism."" Seizing private property from citizens is a hallmark of many communist and socialist governments. About a year ago, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, another Democrat, pitched the idea of city government seizing some buildings from landlords in a proposal that critics derided as “straight communism.” “My first reaction was: Is this communist Cuba?” state Assemblymember Nicole Malliotakis, who ran against De Blasio in the 2017 mayoral race, and is now running for Congress, told Fox News at the time. “I can say that as a daughter of Cuban refugees who fled Castro’s Cuba in 1959, this is what happened to her family, she had her home taken, my grandfather had his gas station taken.

Later, de Blasio said New York City's Rikers Island prison would release 300 inmates.

"                          Vice President Mike Pence tells Fox News that FEMA has shipped 2,000 ventilators from the national stockpile to New York with another 2,000 on the way. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.  Sign up here. Vice President Pence said Tuesday the federal government sent 2,000 ventilators from the national stockpile to the state of New York, which has become the epicenter of coronavirus in the U.S., and vowed to send 2,000 more on Wednesday. “I just received word, and the challenge the state of New York faces. Earlier today, FEMA [the Federal Emergency Management Agency], from the national stockpile, shipped 2,000 ventilators to the state of New York,” Pence said during Fox News’ virtual coronavirus town hall Tuesday. PENCE SAYS WH NOT CONSIDERING NATIONAL QUARANTINE AMID CORONAVIRUS “Tomorrow, there will be another 2,000 ventilators shipped from the national stockpile,” Pence said. “We have a ways to go yet, it’s the reason why we’re marshaling all the resources, not just from national stockpiles but from our existing supply in hospitals, and that equipment can be converted.” Pence went on to stress to “the people in New York” that the 2,000 ventilators “were sent directly” to the state. Pence’s comments come after the president tweeted early Tuesday saying that the government had sent just 400 ventilators to New York. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo had requested some 15,000 ventilators to deal with the outbreak in the state. De Blasio and Cuomo, both Democrats, repeatedly have sounded the alarm on the shortage of ventilators in New York City hospitals, as many COVID-19 patients need the machines to help them breathe. Responding to a recent FEMA shipment of 400 ventilators, Cuomo said at a Tuesday news conference: “You want a pat on the back for sending 400 ventilators?... What are we going to do with 400 ventilators when we need 30,000?” He added: “I will turn this state upside down to get the number of beds we need.” New York now has more than 25,000 positive cases of coronavirus in the state, with roughly half of them in New York City. CUOMO SAYS NEW YORK MAY NEED AS MANY AS 140,000 HOSPITAL BEDS AMID COVID-19 CRISIS IN STATE To help the state grapple with the outbreak, Cuomo has also announced four sites in the state that will serve as additional space for hospitals overflowing due to the coronavirus outbreak. “We projected an apex at 100,000 hospital beds needed,” Cuomo said Tuesday. “The new projection suggests as high as 140,000 hospital beds will be needed.” Cuomo said that the coronavirus curve in the state hasn’t been “flattened” and instead “is actually increasing,” saying the peak of the virus in the state is likely to hit New York in 14 to 21 days. “New York is the canary in the coal mine,” Cuomo said. “New York is going first. We have the fastest and highest rate of infection. What’s happening in New York is going to happen in California, Washington Illinois, it’s just a matter of time.” Cuomo said that once New York has stifled the rate of infection and spread of the virus, it would be able to help other states not yet hit by the illness. Cuomo also vowed to explore every option to expand hospital capacity, including dorms and hotels. “I will turn the state upside down to get the number of beds we need,” he said.

President Trump on Friday invoked the Stafford Act while declaring a national emergency to help battle the coronavirus pandemic.  ""I worked very closely with Governor Cuomo, and this is the first time in our nation's history that a president used the Stafford Act to declare a major disaster response to a public health crisis,"" Trump said during Saturday's White House coronavirus task force press briefing. ""Never happened before. I'm considering other areas where we may or may not be doing that."" So just what is the Stafford Act?        President Donald Trump speaks about the coronavirus in the James Brady Briefing Room, Tuesday, March 24, 2020, in Washington.       (AP) The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act of 1988, named after for former Vermont Republican Sen. Robert Stafford, allows the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to help state and local governments during natural catastrophes.  The act is usually used in response to natural disasters like hurricanes and floods, having been most recently invoked when tornadoes hit Tennessee. But some of its provisions are useful in response to a pandemic like the coronavirus.  In a letter earlier this month, Trump signaled he would invoke the Stafford Act “based on the fact that our entire country is now facing a significant public health emergency.”  A president may invoke the Stafford Act when state and local officials have determined that an appropriate response to a “major disaster” – like a hurricane or earthquake – exceeds their resources. These areas will then have access to the Disaster Relief Fund, which currently contains about $35 billion.  TRUMP CALLS FOR RESTARTING ECONOMY BY EASTER: ‘WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO WORK’  Trump’s assertion that he is the first president to use the Stafford Act for a public health crisis is not entirely accurate. President Bill Clinton used the act in 2000 in response to West Nile outbreaks in New Jersey and New York.

The coronavirus has poured fuel on to the fire of an already raging debate surrounding abortion access as both sides discuss whether pandemic-related restrictions on medical care should apply to abortion clinics, as well. On Tuesday, a long list of pro-life leaders sent a letter demanding that the Health and Human Services Department (HHS) refrain from promoting abortion during the pandemic. Signed by leaders such as Marjorie Dannenfelser of the Susan B. Anthony List, the letter complained that abortion clinics were putting women at risk by sidestepping guidelines surrounding elective medical procedures. ""While surgery centers postpone elective and diagnostic procedures, abortion centers are churning out surgical and chemical abortions and putting women, especially the poor, at risk,"" the letter reads. ""Their continued operation depletes sorely needed personal protective equipment and leads to complications that will further overwhelm already overextended emergency rooms."" HHS did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is housed under HHS, advises health care facilities to ""delay inpatient and outpatient elective surgical and procedural cases."" SUPREME COURT HEARS ORAL ARGUMENTS IN LOUISIANA ABORTION CASE Ohio and Texas specifically directed abortion clinics to delay surgical abortions, describing them as non-essential services during the outbreak of COVID-19. Both states included exceptions for the health of the mother. NARAL, a leading pro-choice organization, seemed to criticize those states' decisions when it tweeted that ""abortion care is essential. Full stop."" The group has also blamed the administration for not doing enough to fund health care during the pandemic, nor ease restrictions on medicinal abortions obtained via telemedicine. Planned Parenthood similarly panned abortion restrictions as a way of playing politics with a public health emergency. 6 FEMALE UTAH SENATORS WALK OFF FLOOR TO PROTEST ABORTION ULTRASOUND BILL ""The safety and health of patients, our staff, and our communities must remain the highest priority as our country faces an unprecedented crisis,"" Planned Parenthood Acting President and CEO Alexis McGill Johnson said. ""Delays or additional barriers to care can make it more difficult or even impossible for some patients to access safe, legal abortion,"" she continued. ""While we continue to provide critical care during this pandemic and work with our partner health care providers, we must still ensure that patients can access the services they need. Unfortunately, while public health providers are working together in our communities to be there for patients whose health care can’t wait, some anti-abortion activists are exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic to push their ideological agenda. This is not the time for politicians or groups to advance their own agenda by taking advantage of a worldwide pandemic.” Pro-choice groups generally argue that abortion is ""safe,"" a claim that pro-life advocates ridicule given its impact on the unborn child and potential for complications. Former Planned Parenthood director Abby Johnson decried abortion clinic conditions in a statement provided to Fox News. Her organization runs a project -- CheckMyClinic.org -- that tracks health violations at clinics around the country. ""The abortion industry,"" the pro-life advocate said, ""is scrambling to figure out how to stay in business and continue to rake in money during this pandemic ... Waiting rooms in clinics are often packed. Abortion clinics aren't known for their pristine hygiene -- look at any state health department report to find violations like failing to sanitize equipment, rips and tears in tables, unlicensed staff."" PRO-LIFE WOMEN CRITICIZE ACTRESS BUSY PHILIPPS' PRAISE FOR ABORTION: 'WOMEN DESERVE BETTER' She added: ""They argue that their services are finite and therefore essential. That's accurate. I mean at some point the 'pregnancy' becomes a baby, right? And then it can't be aborted and that's what the abortion industry is so scared of."" The controversy came after a series of events -- including a recent Supreme Court case -- reignited debate about the safety and benefits of abortion. Pamela Whitehead, who leads the CheckMyClinic project, was more detailed about Texas' and Ohio's clinics. Both states include clinics that don't comply with health and safety regulations, she said. ""Preterm Clinic in Ohio has a documented history of botched abortions,"" she said. She added that ""at [Planned Parenthood] in Bedford Heights, medical records weren't accurate and complete. In Texas, we've seen repeated violations at Planned Parenthood and private clinics ... for not wearing PPE [personal protective equipment] in the surgical suite, ripped exam tables, failure to properly sterilize instruments, unqualified staff."" DAN LIPINSKI'S LOSS SEEN AS TURNING POINT FOR PRO-LIFE DEMS, BLOW TO BIG TENT POLITICS Planned Parenthood has repeatedly defended itself as a quality health care provider. The organization told Fox News it intended to follow through on Ohio's regulations. “We are complying with the Ohio Department of Health’s order regarding personal protective equipment, which requires hospitals and surgical facilities to stop providing non-essential surgeries and procedures and take other steps to reduce the use of equipment in short supply,"" McGill Johnson said. ""PPSWO’s [Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region's] attorney immediately responded to Ohio Attorney General Yost’s letter, assuring him that PPSWO was complying with Director Acton’s order. Under that order, Planned Parenthood can still continue providing essential procedures, including surgical abortion, and our health centers continue to offer other health care services that our patients depend on. Our doors remain open for this care."" In recent months, both sides of the abortion debate have challenged the other's narrative about the potential pitfalls of the procedure. Pro-choice advocates point to a study by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine, whose author argued that abortions in the U.S. were ""safe and effective."" The study looked at four different types of abortion, including medicinal abortions, which have received heightened attention as COVID-19 made traveling to or staying in health care facilities more hazardous. The report determined that complications for all types of abortion were ""rare."" Mayo Clinic advises that surgical abortions can perforate a woman's uterus and may result in infection, although it says infections are ""rare."" Pro-life advocates also argue that medicinal abortions can lead to hemorrhaging for the mother. The issue came to a head earlier this year when media outlets suggested a study highlighted the dangers of a treatment designed to reverse the effects of an abortion pill. The study, which had a small sample size, actually showed how dangerous the medication really was, pro-life advocates said. CLICK HERE TO GET COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE NARAL said on Tuesday that it was ""absolutely absurd"" that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) wouldn't reconsider restrictions on medicinal abortions obtained through telemedicine: ""During a pandemic, the government should be doing everything it can to make care more accessible, not less."" In a statement to Vice, the FDA said its regulations were necessary to ensure that the ""benefits"" of the medication outweighed its ""risks."" “Certain restrictions, known as a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS), are necessary for mifepristone when used for medical termination of early pregnancy in order to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks,” the agency told the outlet.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. The White House and Senate leaders reached a breakthrough deal shortly after midnight Wednesday on a massive and historic $2 trillion coronavirus relief package for workers and businesses, capping days of heated negotiations that had nearly been derailed by last-minute demands from House Democrats. “Ladies and gentleman, we are done,"" White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland announced as he left the office of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., near midnight. ""We have a deal."" Ueland told reporters that ""much of the work on bill text has been completed and I’m hopeful over the next few hours we’ll finish what's left and we will circulate it early in the morning.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the bill amounts to “unemployment compensation on steroids,"" and that every American who is laid off will have their missed salary remunerated. That bombshell provision will enable companies to stay afloat and immediately bring back those employees when things are safe‬, Schumer said. In a letter to his colleagues, Schumer remarked, “Democrats are ready to give our unanimous consent to speed up the consideration of the bill and get the job done.“ That means that if there are no objections from Republicans, the Senate could clear thie bill without a formal roll call vote. Parliamentarily, that is the fastest way to move something on the floor. A senior GOP source told Fox News contributor and Townhall.com editor Guy Benson that the move was a face-saving exercise by Schumer, and that he was trying to ""take credit"" for a GOP bill that he filibustered for ""small ball"" alterations. Democrats, the source said, couldn't drag the situation out much longer; economic conditions have worsened dramatically, and President Trump's approval rating has risen. McConnell said the Senate will meet at 12 p.m. ET on Wednesday, but did not set a time for a vote. By rule, the procedural vote to begin debate on the coronavirus package would happen at 1 p.m. ET, unless the Senate scraps that vote‬.       Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky. walks to the Senate chamber on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, March 24, 2020. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)       “Democrats are finally taking ‘yes’ for an answer,"" McConnell said in his remarks on the Senate floor early Wednesday morning. ""Help is on the way.” “After days of intense discussions, the Senate has reached a bipartisan agreement on a historic relief package for this pandemic,” he continued. “It will rush new resources onto the front lines of our nation's health care fight. And it will inject trillions of dollars of cash into the economy as fast as possible to help Americans workers, families, small businesses and industries make it through this disruption and emerge on the other side ready to soar."" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who was smiling after McConnell left the floor, told reporters: ""This is a very important bipartisan piece of legislation that is going to be very important to help American workers, American business and people across America. So, we couldn't be more pleased. I've spoken to the president, many times today, and he's very pleased with this legislation, and the impact that this is going to have."" Concerning the House, Mnuchin remarked, ""I can't speak for the Speaker. I hope she takes it up and she passes as-is. We need, we need this to get working for the American people. And, again, there are a lot of compromises. It's terrific bill, and it was a great accomplishment on everyone."" However, Mnuchin spoke, Michigan independent Rep. Justin Amash, who recently left the Republican Party, signaled that he might essentially delay consideration of the bill in the House. The lower chamber may seek to pass the legislation via unanimous consent because many members are not in Washington -- but a single member can ruin that plan.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)       ""This bipartisan deal is a raw deal for the people,"" Amash tweeted. ""It does far too little for those who need the most help, while providing hundreds of billions in corporate welfare, massively growing government, inhibiting economic adaptation, and widening the gap between the rich and the poor."" The unprecedented economic rescue package would give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines, given that Democrats wanted them to abide by new carbon emissions restrictions. Hospitals would get significant help as well. DEMS FUME AS TRUMP SAYS COUNTRY MAY BE REOPENED BY EASTER The deal came hours after President Trump's top economic adviser said an unprecedented $6 trillion stimulus plan was imminent, including $4 trillion in liquidity from the Federal Reserve and $2 trillion in new money from Congress. Tensions then abruptly ratcheted back up again on Capitol Hill Tuesday night -- with Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham and Steve Daines taking to the Senate floor and calling for an end to negotiations because, as Graham put it, Democrats were ""nickel-and-diming at a time when people are dying -- literally dying."" Graham and Daines' late-night push for an immediate vote on a stimulus bill came after tensions seemingly had cooled in Congress during the day, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its highest point gain in its history as leaders from both parties signaled that an agreement could be within reach.

Japan's Nikkei 225 index jumped 5.3 percent, while Hong Kong added 3 percent and Sydney climbed 3.6 percent. Markets across Asia were all up more than 2 percent. ""Ladies and gentleman, we are done.

""In case you're watching,"" Graham said in reference to the president, his voice rising, ""tell [Treasury Secretary] Steven Mnuchin to come back to the White House and end negotiations. I think I understand the give-and-take of life and politics, but I've been called by two good friends on the Democratic side in the last five or six hours wanting more money. End the negotiations."" He added: ""This bill is $2 trillion. There's a ton of money in this bill for people who need it, but what we're doing now is, every special-interest group in town is trying to get a little bit more."" “Listen, we were told we are at the one-yard line last night to get this done,"" Daines, who led the colloquy with Graham, said from the Senate floor. ""All I’ve got to say is, the Senate may think it’s at the one-yard line right now, but Montanans are getting sacked.

Senate Democrats in the meantime repeatedly blocked the Republican stimulus bill, which would require 60 votes to survive.

"                          At last we have a deal, announces Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell; congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. White House and Senate leaders reached a historic deal shortly after midnight Wednesday on a massive $2 trillion coronavirus relief package for workers and businesses, although support in the House of Representatives remained uncertain as one member openly criticized the plan. The bipartisan breakthrough in the Senate capped days of heated negotiations that had nearly been derailed by last-minute demands from House Democrats. “Ladies and gentleman, we are done,"" White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland announced as he left the office of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., near midnight. ""We have a deal."" Ueland told reporters that ""much of the work on bill text has been completed, and I’m hopeful over the next few hours we’ll finish what's left and we will circulate it early in the morning.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the bill amounts to “unemployment compensation on steroids,"" and that every American who is laid off will have their missed salary remunerated. That provision will enable companies to stay afloat and immediately bring back those employees when things are safe‬, Schumer said. The unprecedented economic rescue package would give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home.       Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky. walks to the Senate chamber on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, March 24, 2020. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)       One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines, given that Democrats wanted them to abide by new carbon emissions restrictions. Hospitals would get significant help as well. In a letter to his colleagues, Schumer remarked, “Democrats are ready to give our unanimous consent to speed up the consideration of the bill and get the job done.“ That means that if there are no objections from Republicans, the Senate could clear the bill without a formal roll call vote. Parliamentarily, that is the fastest way to move something on the floor. A senior GOP source told Fox News contributor and Townhall.com editor Guy Benson that the move was a face-saving exercise by Schumer, and that he was trying to ""take credit"" for a GOP bill that he filibustered for ""small ball"" alterations. Democrats, the source said, couldn't drag the situation out much longer; economic conditions have worsened dramatically, and President Trump's approval rating has risen. McConnell said the Senate will meet at noon on Wednesday, but did not set a time for a vote. By rule, the procedural vote to begin debate on the coronavirus package would happen at 1 p.m. ET, unless the Senate scraps that vote‬. “Democrats are finally taking ‘yes’ for an answer,"" McConnell said in his remarks on the Senate floor early Wednesday morning. ""Help is on the way.” “After days of intense discussions, the Senate has reached a bipartisan agreement on a historic relief package for this pandemic,” he continued. “It will rush new resources onto the front lines of our nation's health care fight. And it will inject trillions of dollars of cash into the economy as fast as possible to help Americans workers, families, small businesses and industries make it through this disruption and emerge on the other side ready to soar."" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who was smiling after McConnell left the floor, told reporters: ""This is a very important bipartisan piece of legislation that is going to be very important to help American workers, American business and people across America. So, we couldn't be more pleased. I've spoken to the president, many times today, and he's very pleased with this legislation, and the impact that this is going to have."" DEMS FUME AS TRUMP SAYS COUNTRY MAY BE REOPENED BY EASTER Concerning the House, Mnuchin remarked, ""I can't speak for the Speaker. I hope she takes it up and she passes as-is. We need, we need this to get working for the American people. And, again, there are a lot of compromises. It's terrific bill, and it was a great accomplishment on everyone."" Michigan independent Rep. Justin Amash, who recently left the Republican Party, signaled that he might essentially delay consideration of the bill in the House. The lower chamber may seek to pass the legislation via unanimous consent because many members are not in Washington -- but a single member can ruin that plan.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)       The House used unanimous consent during the 1918 flu pandemic as well. ""This bipartisan deal is a raw deal for the people,"" Amash tweeted. ""It does far too little for those who need the most help, while providing hundreds of billions in corporate welfare, massively growing government, inhibiting economic adaptation, and widening the gap between the rich and the poor."" The deal came hours after President Trump's top economic adviser said an unprecedented $6 trillion stimulus plan was imminent, including $4 trillion in liquidity from the Federal Reserve and $2 trillion in new money from Congress. Tensions then abruptly ratcheted back up again on Capitol Hill Tuesday night -- with Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham and Steve Daines taking to the Senate floor and calling for an end to negotiations because, as Graham put it, Democrats were ""nickel-and-diming at a time when people are dying -- literally dying."" Graham and Daines' late-night push for an immediate vote on a stimulus bill came after tensions seemingly had cooled in Congress during the day, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its highest point gain in its history as leaders from both parties signaled that an agreement could be within reach.

"                          President Trump tells Fox News that he wants the economy to reopen 'very soon' amid the COVID-19 pandemic. We’re all going to hear this phrase again and again: “We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself.” That’s what President Trump said at Monday’s briefing, and it reflects a major shift in his thinking, amplified by conservative commentators but also some on the left. It’s also pretty unnerving. The argument is that shutting down much of the economy is so drastic that the damage will be irreversible -- and that this could also hurt people’s health care if millions more lose their jobs. A TRULY AWFUL IDEA: SOME LIBERALS WOULD PULL PLUG ON TRUMP’S BRIEFINGS The president, comparing the situation to the seasonal flu, declared in a Fox town hall interview Tuesday that if America remains closed for business, “You’re going to lose people. You’re going to have suicides by the thousands.” But medical experts are urging the administration to stay the course, saying the death toll from the coronavirus could skyrocket if the country starts reopening businesses and schools and people again start congregating in close quarters. As the New York Times puts it, “Relaxing those restrictions could significantly increase the death toll from the virus, public health officials warn. Many economists say there is no positive trade-off — resuming normal activity prematurely would only strain hospitals and result in even more deaths, while exacerbating a recession that has most likely already arrived.” Clearly the financial impact, with some projecting a 30 percent shrinkage of the economy and unemployment soaring to 13 percent, is frightening. And the president, who is running for reelection, is obviously concerned by a stock market that has plummeted by one-third. That’s despite yesterday’s gains as Congress closed in on a $2-trillion bailout plan. Just over a week after much of the country went into virtual lockdown, especially such states as New York, CalifoCure Worse Than Disease? Trump, Pundits Want Restrictions Easedrnia, Illinois and Virginia, Trump is looking at easing the restrictions when the current 15-day period expires next Monday -- even though the virus in America is at more than 40,000 cases and rising. “Our country wasn’t built to be shut down,” Trump said. ""America will, again, and soon, be open for business. Very soon.” The Washington Post says the president “has received urgent pleas from rattled business leaders, Republican lawmakers and conservative economists imploring him to remove some of the stringent social distancing guidelines that he put in place.” Here’s the case from Fox’s Steve Hilton, one of a number of conservative pundits arguing that we’ve gone too far: “Quite frankly, if they keep up the shutdowns until the end of May, they'll need $5 trillion; if it's in August, $12 trillion. This is an inconceivable amount of public money. It amounts to a total government takeover of the economy...Don't turn a public health crisis into America's worst catastrophe.” Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, 69, went so far as to suggest that older people--who are in the highest-risk group--should be willing to die to protect the young. “No one reached out to me and said, as a senior citizen, are you willing to take a chance on your survival in exchange for keeping the America that all America loves for your children and grandchildren? And if that's the exchange, I'm all in,” he said on Fox. SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES But NYU bioethics professor Arthur Caplan is making the counter-argument, telling the Times: “You can’t call off the best weapon we have, which is social isolation, even out of economic desperation, unless you’re willing to be responsible for a mountain of deaths...Can’t we try to put people’s lives first for at least a month?” And Joe Biden said yesterday on “The View” that “I don’t agree with the notion that somehow it’s okay to let people die.” Yet this is not just a save-business-first campaign by the right. Andrew Cuomo, who is basking in praise for his blunt briefings from Albany, said at Monday’s session that “you can’t stop the economy forever.” The New York governor said “we have to start to think about does everyone stay out of work? Should young people go back to work sooner? Can we test for those who had the virus, resolved, and are now immune and can they start to go back to work?” Cuomo said yesterday that if the two priorities collide, public health must come first. These are the very questions the White House is examining. Liberal Times columnist Tom Friedman, a fierce Trump critic, asks whether we can “more surgically minimize the threat of this virus to those most vulnerable while we maximize the chances for as many Americans as possible to safely go back to work as soon as possible.” After interviewing many leading experts, the three-time Pulitzer winner concludes: “Either we let many of us get the coronavirus, recover and get back to work — while doing our utmost to protect those most vulnerable to being killed by it. Or, we shut down for months to try to save everyone everywhere from this virus — no matter their risk profile — and kill many people by other means, kill our economy and maybe kill our future.” My own view is that there’s a reason that Britain and India, which had resisted such drastic steps, have just ordered a three-week lockdown. And there’s a reason such medical veterans as Anthony Fauci are saying it’s too soon to lift the restrictions for at least several more weeks. Given that hospitals are starting to be overwhelmed and still don’t have enough masks, ventilators and respirators, it could be a catastrophic mistake to take steps that could overwhelm them with an even bigger surge of virus patients. Cuomo said yesterday that the rate of infection in New York, the virus epicenter, is doubling about every three days. He said the state, which has 53,000 hospital beds, now needs 140,000, and that the feds must order ventilators into production. But Trump, and to some extent Cuomo, are right: we can’t shut down the economy indefinitely. The question is how to balance the twin crises of medical health and financial health in ways that do the least harm to each one.    ",         Cure worse than disease?

President Trump taunted Mitt Romney on Wednesday after the Utah senator tested negative for coronavirus, ostensibly cheering the news before going on to slam his record as a presidential candidate and member of Congress. “This is really great news! I am so happy I can barely speak. He may have been a terrible presidential candidate and an even worse U.S. Senator, but he is a RINO, and I like him a lot!” Trump tweeted early Wednesday. A “RINO,” as Trump called Romney, stands for “Republican In Name Only.” Romney, R-Utah, went into self-quarantine after learning on Sunday that Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., with whom he had spent time over the weekend during negotiations over the Senate GOP’s proposed stimulus package, had tested positive. Romney was tested for COVID-19 on Monday and received negative results late Tuesday, but said he would stay quarantined. THESE US SENATORS ARE IN SELF-QUARANTINE AMID COVID-19 THREAT ""Thankfully, I tested negative for COVID-19,"" Romney tweeted. ""Nevertheless, guidance from my physician, consistent with CDC guidelines, requires me to remain in quarantine as the test does not rule out the onset of symptoms during the 14-day period."" Trump, during a press briefing on Sunday, first learned of Romney’s potential exposure. “Romney‘s in isolation?” Trump said. “Gee, that’s too bad.” When asked if there was sarcasm in his comment, he said: “No, none at all.” Trump and Romney have long been at odds. Romney broke party ranks last month, voting in favor of finding Trump guilty of abuse of power in the Senate’s impeachment trial. Romney, though stuck with Republican senators in voting to acquit Trump on the second article of impeachment—obstruction of Congress. ROMNEY, PAST CPAC STRAW POLL WINNER, NOW PANNED AS 'POLITICAL OPPORTUNIST' AT CONFERENCE  Romney and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who also went into self-quarantine after interacting with Paul, have missed key procedural votes on a phase three stimulus bill. Those votes failed, but senators have since struck a deal and plan to call up the legislation in the near future. Sens. Cory Gardner, R-Co., and Rick Scott, R-Fla., also missed the votes and are in self-quarantine after having interacted with other individuals who tested positive for COVID-19. Paul is the only senator known to have tested positive at this time. Meanwhile, Trump also took a swipe at Michael Avenatti, Stormy Daniels' former attorney, who requested he be released from prison amid the coronavirus outbreak. A judge on Tuesday rejected Avenatti's plea. ""Gee, that’s too bad. Such a fine guy. Presidential aspirations you know!"" Trump tweeted. Avenatti, in 2019, briefly weighed a presidential run. He is currently doing time after being convicted of extortion.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. White House and Senate leaders reached a historic deal shortly after midnight Wednesday on a massive $2 trillion coronavirus relief package for workers and businesses, although support in the House of Representatives remained uncertain as one member openly criticized the plan. The bipartisan breakthrough in the Senate capped days of heated negotiations that had nearly been derailed by last-minute demands from House Democrats. “Ladies and gentleman, we are done,"" White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland announced as he left the office of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., near midnight. ""We have a deal."" Ueland told reporters that ""much of the work on bill text has been completed, and I’m hopeful over the next few hours we’ll finish what's left and we will circulate it early in the morning.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the bill amounts to “unemployment compensation on steroids,"" and that every American who is laid off will have their missed salary remunerated. That provision will enable companies to stay afloat and immediately bring back those employees when things are safe‬, Schumer said. The unprecedented economic rescue package would give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)       One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines, given that Democrats wanted them to abide by new carbon emissions restrictions. But, support for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's climate-change push in the stimulus bill withered Tuesday. The former chief of staff to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Saikat Chakrabarti, wrote on Twitter: ""I helped write the #GreenNewDeal and I think this is ridiculous. The tiny little emissions standard increase doesn’t even do anything meaningful to stave off climate change and gives the @GOP  leverage to get rid of real help for working people. Solve the problem at hand. Hospitals would get significant help as well."" In a letter to his colleagues, Schumer remarked, “Democrats are ready to give our unanimous consent to speed up the consideration of the bill and get the job done.“ That means that if there are no objections from Republicans, the Senate could clear the bill without a formal roll call vote. Parliamentarily, that is the fastest way to move something on the floor. A senior GOP source told Fox News contributor and Townhall.com editor Guy Benson that the move was a face-saving exercise by Schumer, and that he was trying to ""take credit"" for a GOP bill that he filibustered for ""small ball"" alterations. Democrats, the source said, couldn't drag the situation out much longer; economic conditions have worsened dramatically, and President Trump's approval rating has risen. McConnell said the Senate will meet at noon on Wednesday, but did not set a time for a vote. By rule, the procedural vote to begin debate on the coronavirus package would happen at 1 p.m. ET, unless the Senate scraps that vote‬. “Democrats are finally taking ‘yes’ for an answer,"" McConnell said in his remarks on the Senate floor early Wednesday morning. ""Help is on the way.” “After days of intense discussions, the Senate has reached a bipartisan agreement on a historic relief package for this pandemic,” he continued. “It will rush new resources onto the front lines of our nation's health care fight. And it will inject trillions of dollars of cash into the economy as fast as possible to help Americans workers, families, small businesses and industries make it through this disruption and emerge on the other side ready to soar."" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who was smiling after McConnell left the floor, told reporters: ""This is a very important bipartisan piece of legislation that is going to be very important to help American workers, American business and people across America. So, we couldn't be more pleased. I've spoken to the president, many times today, and he's very pleased with this legislation, and the impact that this is going to have."" DEMS FUME AS TRUMP SAYS COUNTRY MAY BE REOPENED BY EASTER Concerning the House, Mnuchin remarked, ""I can't speak for the Speaker. I hope she takes it up and she passes as-is. We need, we need this to get working for the American people. And, again, there are a lot of compromises. It's a terrific bill, and it was a great accomplishment on everyone."" In a statement Wednesday morning, Pelosi said that ""House Democrats will now review the final provisions and legislative text of the agreement to determine a course of action.”       Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, left, accompanied by White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland and acting White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, speaks with reporters as he walks to the offices of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky. on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, March 24, 2020. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)       “This bipartisan legislation takes us a long way down the road in meeting the needs of the American people,"" she wrote. ""While the compromise does not go as far as our Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act, thanks to the unity and insistence of Senate and House Democrats, the bill has moved a great deal closer to America’s workers."" Michigan independent Rep. Justin Amash, who recently left the Republican Party, signaled that he might essentially delay consideration of the bill in the House. The lower chamber may seek to pass the legislation via unanimous consent because many members are not in Washington -- but a single member can ruin that plan. The House used unanimous consent during the 1918 flu pandemic as well. ""This bipartisan deal is a raw deal for the people,"" Amash tweeted. ""It does far too little for those who need the most help, while providing hundreds of billions in corporate welfare, massively growing government, inhibiting economic adaptation, and widening the gap between the rich and the poor."" The deal came hours after President Trump's top economic adviser said an unprecedented $6 trillion stimulus plan was imminent, including $4 trillion in liquidity from the Federal Reserve and $2 trillion in new money from Congress. Tensions then abruptly ratcheted back up again on Capitol Hill Tuesday night -- with Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham and Steve Daines taking to the Senate floor and calling for an end to negotiations because, as Graham put it, Democrats were ""nickel-and-diming at a time when people are dying -- literally dying."" Graham and Daines' late-night push for an immediate vote on a stimulus bill came after tensions seemingly had cooled in Congress during the day, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its highest point gain in its history as leaders from both parties signaled that an agreement could be within reach. Shares advanced in Asia on Wednesday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged to its best day since 1933 as Congress and the White House neared a deal. Japan's Nikkei 225 index jumped 5.3 percent, while Hong Kong added 3 percent and Sydney climbed 3.6 percent. Markets across Asia were all up more than 2 percent. But, the Republicans said late Tuesday, Democrats were still seeking new payouts that were delaying a vote on a final bill. ""In case you're watching,"" Graham said in reference to the president, his voice rising, ""tell [Treasury Secretary] Steven Mnuchin to come back to the White House and end negotiations. I think I understand the give-and-take of life and politics, but I've been called by two good friends on the Democratic side in the last five or six hours wanting more money. End the negotiations."" He added: ""This bill is $2 trillion. There's a ton of money in this bill for people who need it, but what we're doing now is, every special-interest group in town is trying to get a little bit more."" “Listen, we were told we are at the one-yard line last night to get this done,"" Daines, who led the colloquy with Graham, said from the Senate floor. ""All I’ve got to say is, the Senate may think it’s at the one-yard line right now, but Montanans are getting sacked. In fact, our unemployment claims in Montana since march 17th, we just looked it up 15 minutes ago, 14,350 Montanans have filed for unemployment in the last week.” Shortly before Graham and Daines spoke, Trump declared at a coronovirus task force briefing that the country was nearing ""the end of our historic battle"" with ""the invisible enemy"" of coronavirus. Trump's approval numbers hit their highest point ever this week, with 60 percent of Americans approving of his coronavirus response efforts. WATCH: TRUMP SAYS CORONAVIRUS SHUTDOWN MAY BE OVER BY EASTER The president also sounded an unexpectedly magnanimous note: ""I also want to thank Congress, because whether or not we're happy that they haven't quite gotten there yet, they have been working long hours. I'm talking Republicans and Democrats, all of them, the House, the Senate. I want to thank Congress because they are really trying to get there, and I think they will."" Then, Director of the U.S. National Economic Council Larry Kudlow specifically said the new coronavirus bill working its way through congressional gridlock would total $6 trillion: $4 trillion in liquidity from the Federal Reserve and $2 trillion in new money. Typical annual appropriations from Congress in a given fiscal year are around $1.2-4 trillion, with total expenditures roughly $4.3 trillion. “This package will be the single largest Main Street assistance program in the history of the United States,” Kudlow said, adding that negotiations would continue into the evening but that a vote was imminent. Meanwhile, there was some good news inside the White House grounds. As the briefing concluded, White House press Secretary Stephanie Grisham, who has been quarantined since coming in contact with Brazilian officials almost two weeks ago and working from home, revealed she has received negative COVID-19 test results and will be back to work Wednesday. Grisham will return as the Trump administration increasingly has sought to project optimism. The president, who tweeted Sunday that ""WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF,"" declared at the Fox News virtual town hall that he ""would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter.""       Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, center, on his way to the offices of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)       Pressed by Fox News' John Roberts on the timeline, Trump said at the briefing: ""We'll be looking at a lot of things -- we'll also be looking at very large portions of our country, but I'll be guided very much by Dr. [Anthony] Fauci, and by Deborah [Birx]."" Fauci, the longtime head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, whose absence from recent coronavirus briefings triggered a wave of speculation in the media, said the timeline was still ""flexible."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Democrats have reacted furiously to Trump's new timeline for relaxing economic restrictions, with Hillary Clinton suggesting people would ""needlessly die,"" and Joe Biden accusing Trump of spreading ""misinformation.""

On early Wednesday morning, Senate Democrats, Senate Republicans and the White House came to an agreement on a $2 trillion economic stimulus package meant to combat the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic, setting the measure up for a likely Wednesday vote in the Senate and potential enactment later this week. Leaders from both parties focused on ensuring that the bill, at least in part, targeted average Americans dealing with hardship related to the widespread economic slowdown resulting from stay-at-home orders and social distancing guidelines meant to stem the spread of the pandemic in the United States. One of those measures beefs up unemployment insurance in an effort to ease the sting on workers who are getting laid off because their businesses are closed. Here's how the proposal, which Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called ""unemployment insurance on steroids"" early Wednesday, will work if signed into law by President Trump.

(Senate Television via AP)       WHITE HOUSE, SENATE STRIKE DEAL ON HISTORIC $2T CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL, BUT HOUSE SUPPORT REMAINS UNCERTAIN Time The Senate bill, if enacted, would give Americans four months of unemployment insurance, an increase from the current three months. Schumer said the change ""ensures that laid-off workers, on average, will receive their full pay for four months."" Businesses Schumer also indicated that the unemployment insurance expansion would not just cover individuals who fall under the typical definition of an employee. ""It ensures that all workers are protected whether they work for businesses small, medium or large, along with self-employed and workers in the gig economy,"" Schumer said on Wednesday morning, Because the final text of the bill has not been released yet, it is unclear how exactly the unemployment benefits will apply to non-traditional workers or if they would get benefits the same exact way as typical employees under the Senate's scheme. Money Workers who file for unemployment will be able to receive up to $600 per week more than what is currently on the books. This is likely to help Americans who may make more money in their jobs – and thus may have higher expenses – but are temporarily unable to work due to the coronavirus. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sunset Schumer seemed to indicate that the ""unemployment insurance on steroids"" would be rolled back as soon as the coronavirus pandemic is not a threat to Americans. ""Because Democrats insisted on these changes, the assistance to working Americans is not just a one-shot deal, but a paycheck every work period that will go on for as long as the crisis lasts,"" Schumer said. ""We are giving America’s workers some peace of mind, knowing that they will continue to have an income, and it will be there until we defeat this horrible virus.""

Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak has restricted the prescription of two malaria medications that President Trump named as potential remedies for coronavirus, after a man died and his wife was hospitalized for using a fish tank cleaning additive with a similar name as a substitute. Sisolak, a Democrat, issued an executive order Tuesday prohibiting prescriptions of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for coronavirus patients after the president mentioned the two drugs during a press briefing. DOC'S WARNING FOR DIY CORONAVIRUS REMEDIES: 'SERIOUSLY, DON'T DO IT' ""While the two drugs have necessary medical purposes, there is no conclusive evidence at this time among COVID-19 experts or Nevada's own medical health advisory team that the drugs provide treatment for COVID-19 patients,"" Sisolak said in a statement. While addressing reporters, Trump mentioned both drugs as being fast-tracked for use as treatment, touting their likelihood of being effective despite the FDA still testing it for coronavirus use. The order also limits a prescription to a 30-day supply to ensure it’s available for “legitimate medical purposes"" and so that people cannot find a way to stockpile the drug. Sisolak faced a backlash from Trump allies over the order, as the drugs are in fact being used in trials. They are among a select group of possible therapies the World Health Organization is currently looking at as potentially treating or preventing COVID-19, though the effectiveness of the drugs remains unclear. The WHO originally did not have the two drugs as part of their trial, but high interest led them to reconsider.

Graham and Daines' late-night push for an immediate vote on a stimulus bill came after tensions seemingly had cooled in Congress during the day, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its highest point gain in its history as leaders from both parties signaled that an agreement could be within reach. Shares advanced in Asia on Wednesday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged to its best day since 1933 as Congress and the White House neared a deal. Japan's Nikkei 225 index jumped 5.3 percent, while Hong Kong added 3 percent and Sydney climbed 3.6 percent. Markets across Asia were all up more than 2 percent. ""Ladies and gentleman, we are done. We have a deal."" But, the Republicans said late Tuesday, Democrats were still seeking new payouts that were delaying a vote on a final bill. ""In case you're watching,"" Graham said in reference to the president, his voice rising, ""tell [Treasury Secretary] Steven Mnuchin to come back to the White House and end negotiations. I think I understand the give-and-take of life and politics, but I've been called by two good friends on the Democratic side in the last five or six hours wanting more money. End the negotiations."" He added: ""This bill is $2 trillion. There's a ton of money in this bill for people who need it, but what we're doing now is, every special-interest group in town is trying to get a little bit more."" “Listen, we were told we are at the one-yard line last night to get this done,"" Daines, who led the colloquy with Graham, said from the Senate floor. ""All I’ve got to say is, the Senate may think it’s at the one-yard line right now, but Montanans are getting sacked. In fact, our unemployment claims in Montana since march 17th, we just looked it up 15 minutes ago, 14,350 Montanans have filed for unemployment in the last week.” Monday had been marked with furious debate on the Senate floor, as Republicans accused House Democrats of proposing an alternative stimulus bill that was full of unnecessary progressive wishlist items. Senate Democrats in the meantime repeatedly blocked the Republican stimulus bill, which would require 60 votes to survive. The bill offered by Pelosi had included measures to restrict airlines' carbon emissions, protect illegal immigrants, provide for same-day voter registration, pay off billions in student loan debt, encourage federal agencies to employ ""minority banks,"" bail out the U.S. Postal Service and even fund the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. WATCH DAINES' FULL SPEECH ON THE SENATE FLOOR ""There is a whole concern in our country that if we're giving tens of billions of dollars to the airlines, that we could at least have a shared value about what happens to the environment,"" Pelosi said Tuesday. But, support for Democrats' climate-change push in the stimulus bill withered Tuesday. The former chief of staff to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Saikat Chakrabarti, wrote on Twitter in response to Pelosi's comments: ""I helped write the #GreenNewDeal and I think this is ridiculous. The tiny little emissions standard increase doesn’t even do anything meaningful to stave off climate change and gives the @GOP  leverage to get rid of real help for working people. Solve the problem at hand. Hospitals would get significant help as well."" Republicans, including the president, have called the measures irrelevant ""nonsense"" and total nonstarters. After Democrats signaled they might be willing to negotiate away some of their proposals, though, the Dow surged and lawmakers appeared optimistic. Democrats have argued the GOP package would do too much for large corporations and not enough for workers, and inaccurately suggested that the treasury secretary would have unilateral control over a massive ""slush fund."" WHAT'S IN PELOSI'S CORONAVIRUS BILL? ARTS FUNDING, CLIMATE CHANGE WISHLIST, AND MORE ""This is ridiculous,"" Graham continued Tuesday night. ""Steven Mnuchin has done a good job. I appreciate his efforts to negotiate a bill that will help America. Senator [Mitch] McConnell says we're on the two-yard line. I believe the problem is that there are 20 people playing defense, and we need to take some people off the field. What bothers me is that at that late hour, I'm still getting calls from people wanting more money.""       President Trump with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, during a briefing at the White House on Tuesday. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)       Graham and Daines' frustration was matched by many of his colleagues. Louisiana GOP Sen. John Kennedy told Fox News' Sean Hannity late Tuesday that while the coronavirus ""can kill you,"" so can ""hunger."" Shortly before Graham and Daines spoke, Trump declared at a coronovirus task force briefing that the country was nearing ""the end of our historic battle"" with ""the invisible enemy"" of coronavirus. Trump's approval numbers hit their highest point ever this week, with 60 percent of Americans approving of his coronavirus response efforts. WATCH: TRUMP SAYS CORONAVIRUS SHUTDOWN MAY BE OVER BY EASTER The president also sounded an unexpectedly magnanimous note: ""I also want to thank Congress, because whether or not we're happy that they haven't quite gotten there yet, they have been working long hours. I'm talking Republicans and Democrats, all of them, the House, the Senate. I want to thank Congress because they are really trying to get there, and I think they will."" Then, Director of the U.S. National Economic Council Larry Kudlow specifically said the new coronavirus bill working its way through congressional gridlock would total $6 trillion: $4 trillion in liquidity from the Federal Reserve and $2 trillion in new money. Typical annual appropriations from Congress in a given fiscal year are around $1.2-4 trillion, with total expenditures roughly $4.3 trillion. “This package will be the single largest Main Street assistance program in the history of the United States,” Kudlow said, adding that negotiations would continue into the evening but that a vote was imminent. Meanwhile, there was some good news inside the White House grounds. As the briefing concluded, White House press Secretary Stephanie Grisham, who has been quarantined since coming in contact with Brazilian officials almost two weeks ago and working from home, revealed she has received negative COVID-19 test results and will be back to work Wednesday. Grisham will return as the Trump administration increasingly has sought to project optimism. The president, who tweeted Sunday that ""WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF,"" declared at the Fox News virtual town hall that he ""would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter.""

"                          President Trump tells Fox News that he wants the economy to reopen 'very soon' amid the COVID-19 pandemic. We’re all going to hear this phrase again and again: “We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself.” That’s what President Trump said at Monday’s briefing, and it reflects a major shift in his thinking, amplified by conservative commentators but also some on the left. It’s also pretty unnerving. The argument is that shutting down much of the economy is so drastic that the damage will be irreversible -- and that this could also hurt people’s health care if millions more lose their jobs. A TRULY AWFUL IDEA: SOME LIBERALS WOULD PULL PLUG ON TRUMP’S BRIEFINGS The president, comparing the situation to the seasonal flu, declared in a Fox town hall interview Tuesday that if America remains closed for business, “You’re going to lose people. You’re going to have suicides by the thousands.” But medical experts are urging the administration to stay the course, saying the death toll from the coronavirus could skyrocket if the country starts reopening businesses and schools and people again start congregating in close quarters. As the New York Times puts it, “Relaxing those restrictions could significantly increase the death toll from the virus, public health officials warn. Many economists say there is no positive trade-off — resuming normal activity prematurely would only strain hospitals and result in even more deaths, while exacerbating a recession that has most likely already arrived.” Clearly the financial impact, with some projecting a 30 percent shrinkage of the economy and unemployment soaring to 13 percent, is frightening. And the president, who is running for reelection, is obviously concerned by a stock market that has plummeted by one-third. That’s despite yesterday’s gains as Congress closed in on a $2-trillion bailout plan. Just over a week after much of the country went into virtual lockdown, especially such states as New York, California, Illinois and Virginia, Trump is looking at easing the restrictions when the current 15-day period expires next Monday--even though the virus in America is at more than 40,000 cases and rising. “Our country wasn’t built to be shut down,” Trump said. ""America will, again, and soon, be open for business. Very soon.” The Washington Post says the president “has received urgent pleas from rattled business leaders, Republican lawmakers and conservative economists imploring him to remove some of the stringent social distancing guidelines that he put in place.” Here’s the case from Fox’s Steve Hilton, one of a number of conservative pundits arguing that we’ve gone too far: “Quite frankly, if they keep up the shutdowns until the end of May, they'll need $5 trillion; if it's in August, $12 trillion. This is an inconceivable amount of public money. It amounts to a total government takeover of the economy...Don't turn a public health crisis into America's worst catastrophe.” Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, 69, went so far as to suggest that older people--who are in the highest-risk group--should be willing to die to protect the young. “No one reached out to me and said, as a senior citizen, are you willing to take a chance on your survival in exchange for keeping the America that all America loves for your children and grandchildren? And if that's the exchange, I'm all in,” he said on Fox. SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES But NYU bioethics professor Arthur Caplan is making the counter-argument, telling the Times: “You can’t call off the best weapon we have, which is social isolation, even out of economic desperation, unless you’re willing to be responsible for a mountain of deaths...Can’t we try to put people’s lives first for at least a month?” And Joe Biden said yesterday on “The View” that “I don’t agree with the notion that somehow it’s okay to let people die.” Yet this is not just a save-business-first campaign by the right. Andrew Cuomo, who is basking in praise for his blunt briefings from Albany, said at Monday’s session that “you can’t stop the economy forever.” The New York governor said “we have to start to think about does everyone stay out of work? Should young people go back to work sooner? Can we test for those who had the virus, resolved, and are now immune and can they start to go back to work?” Cuomo said yesterday that if the two priorities collide, public health must come first. These are the very questions the White House is examining. Liberal Times columnist Tom Friedman, a fierce Trump critic, asks whether we can “more surgically minimize the threat of this virus to those most vulnerable while we maximize the chances for as many Americans as possible to safely go back to work as soon as possible.” After interviewing many leading experts, the three-time Pulitzer winner concludes: “Either we let many of us get the coronavirus, recover and get back to work — while doing our utmost to protect those most vulnerable to being killed by it. Or, we shut down for months to try to save everyone everywhere from this virus — no matter their risk profile — and kill many people by other means, kill our economy and maybe kill our future.” My own view is that there’s a reason that Britain and India, which had resisted such drastic steps, have just ordered a three-week lockdown. And there’s a reason such medical veterans as Anthony Fauci are saying it’s too soon to lift the restrictions for at least several more weeks. Given that hospitals are starting to be overwhelmed and still don’t have enough masks, ventilators and respirators, it could be a catastrophic mistake to take steps that could overwhelm them with an even bigger surge of virus patients. Cuomo said yesterday that the rate of infection in New York, the virus epicenter, is doubling about every three days. He said the state, which has 53,000 hospital beds, now needs 140,000, and that the feds must order ventilators into production. But Trump, and to some extent Cuomo, are right: we can’t shut down the economy indefinitely. The question is how to balance the twin crises of medical health and financial health in ways that do the least harm to each one.    ",         Cure worse than disease?

"                          Reaction from Hudson Institute's Chinese strategy director Dr. Michael Pillsbury. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. A class-action lawsuit filed in Florida this month seeks to ""make China pay for what they've done"" in its handling of the coronavirus crisis, saying the country acted ""negligently in their handling of the COVID-19 outbreak."" A personal injury law firm based in Boca Raton, Fla., is bringing the suit against China and various Chinese government agencies on behalf of ""individuals and business owners in the United States and State of Florida, for damages suffered as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic."" The suit claims China ""knew that COVID-19 was dangerous and capable of causing a pandemic, yet slowly acted, proverbially put their head in the sand, and/or covered it up in their own economic self-interest."" ""This is an undertaking against a world superpower who has the ability to pay for what they've done,"" Jeremy Alters, the lead spokesperson for the Berman Law Group, the class-action firm backing the suit, told Fox News. ""They have the money to pay for what they've done, and we should all together make China pay for what they've done,"" he said. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW Berman Complaint Against China by Fox News on Scribd WHITE HOUSE, SENATE STRIKE DEAL ON HISTORIC $2T CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL, BUT HOUSE SUPPORT REMAINS UNCERTAIN The original complaint has just a handful of named plaintiffs but the lawyers familiar with the case at Berman Law Group say they plan to file an amended complaint at some point with significantly more plaintiffs, including individuals who have gotten sick because of the coronavirus. The lawsuit does not name a specific dollar amount being sought from China, asking for ""compensatory and other damages to Plaintiffs and the Class Members, for their economic and non-economic damages ... to the full extent permitted by the law."" Alters, however, made clear that though lawyers for Berman would be seeking potentially ""tens of trillions"" from the communist nation, the suit was largely about the symbolism of forcing China to defend its actions in American courts. ""We want the court to make them pay for what they've done,"" Alters said. ""They have unleashed ... a massive pandemic on the world. It appears they knew about it long before they gave information about it to the rest of the world. We want our courts to say, 'China, you are going to be held accountable here in our courts because you have harmed hundreds of millions of Americans.'"" The suit also has the potential, according to its backers, to bring to light documents and other information about the coronavirus that China may still be withholding from other governments and health experts worldwide. This class-action suit is not the first one filed against China over the coronavirus, but it is the first serious complaint. The D.C.-based far-right organization Freedom Watch filed a $20 trillion suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia accusing the Chinese of creating the coronavirus as a bioweapon — an allegation that has been debunked. The Florida-based suit, however, seeks damages based on the Chinese government's negligence in containing the coronavirus after it first was transmitted from animals to humans, an allegation with a large amount of supporting evidence.       Residents wearing face masks purchase seafood at a wet market on Jan. 28 in Macau, China.      (Getty Images) THE CORONAVIRUS DID NOT ESCAPE FROM A LAB: HERE'S HOW WE KNOW This is made difficult, however, by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) which prevents Americans from suing other countries except under specific circumstances. The plaintiffs claim they fit under the exceptions for commercial activity and ""personal injury or death"" that stems from ""the tortious act or omission of that foreign state or of any official or employee of that foreign state while acting within the scope of his office or employment."" Yale law professor Stephen L. Carter, however, argued in a Bloomberg column Tuesday that the Florida suit's claims don't fall under the FSIA exceptions. ""The Florida class action suit asserts that the exception for commercial activities applies, but it’s not easy to see how,"" Carter writes. Carter also notes that the second exemption the Florida plaintiffs claim ""specifically bars any claim 'based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function regardless of whether the discretion be abused.' It’s hard to find a way around this restriction."" But Alters says China's negligence in its response to the coronavirus should fall under the exceptions to FSIA because of how egregious it is. ""There is a lengthy history of precedent for bringing foreign nations to our courts for their bad acts that affect Americans,"" he said Tuesday. ""I don't know in history whether there has been another bad act like this that has affected this many Americans at once, where the entire economy is basically at a standstill and 14 states are now in a stay-at-home order."" The Florida suit against China also is important, according to its backers, because of the collaboration between two very different firms working the case.

Alters, a spokesman for Berman, is a veteran of both Obama presidential campaigns and the 2004 John Kerry presidential campaign. The lobbying and public relations firm working on the case, Lucas Compton, is closer to the right side of the aisle. George Sorial is a partner at Lucas Compton and worked in the Trump Organization for several years before leaving the company to become a campaign surrogate for the now-president. ""It transcends politics,"" Sorial said of the effort to sue China. ""Even if you look at the collaboration of our two firms, two firms on very different sides of the aisle. ... They are who they are, we are who we are, but this transcends politics. ... This is a nonpolitical bipartisan effort on behalf of the United States citizenry. It's almost a patriotic thing to hold that country accountable."" Beyond the FSIA difficulties, another likely weakness in the case is the fact that it treats the idea that the coronavirus potentially came from a lab -- which has been debunked -- as a legitimate ""alternative theory."" This could potentially undermine the majority of its case, which pushes the widely understood story that the virus was transmitted from an animal to a human at a wild animal market in the city of Wuhan before China responded to the health threat with obfuscation and censorship. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Responding to a question about the inclusion of the manmade virus theory in their lawsuit, Alters said the presence of a high-security bio-agent lab in Wuhan ""cannot be ignored."" ""[The Wuhan Institute of Virology] handles the most dangerous viruses,"" he said. ""It resides in the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan. In that lab they cultivate viruses from exotic animals. The wet markets were supposed to be shut down years ago and the Chinese government turned a blind eye to the ongoing operations. This is not coincidental. They also knew of the active and routine trade of these exotic animals which harbor these viruses. The Chinese government has allowed the sale, exchange and consumption of these animals by putting their head in the sand knowing of the dangers this presented locally and internationally.""

"                          At last we have a deal, announces Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell; congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. White House and Senate leaders reached a historic deal shortly after midnight Wednesday on a massive $2 trillion coronavirus relief package for workers and businesses, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi offered something of a tepid endorsement of the agreement after previously pushing for her own legislation. The bipartisan breakthrough in the Senate capped days of heated negotiations that had nearly been derailed by last-minute demands from House Democrats. “Ladies and gentleman, we are done,"" White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland announced as he left the office of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., near midnight. ""We have a deal."" Ueland told reporters that ""much of the work on bill text has been completed, and I’m hopeful over the next few hours we’ll finish what's left and we will circulate it early in the morning.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the bill amounts to “unemployment compensation on steroids,"" and that Americans who have been laid off will have their missed salary remunerated. The package will enable companies to stay afloat and immediately bring back those employees when things are safe‬, Schumer said. The unprecedented economic rescue package would give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home.       Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky. walks to the Senate chamber on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, March 24, 2020. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)       One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines, given that Democrats wanted them to abide by new carbon emissions restrictions. But, support for Pelosi's climate-change push in the stimulus bill withered Tuesday. The former chief of staff to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Saikat Chakrabarti, wrote on Twitter: ""I helped write the #GreenNewDeal and I think this is ridiculous. The tiny little emissions standard increase doesn’t even do anything meaningful to stave off climate change and gives the @GOP  leverage to get rid of real help for working people. Solve the problem at hand. Hospitals would get significant help as well."" In a letter to his colleagues, Schumer remarked, “Democrats are ready to give our unanimous consent to speed up the consideration of the bill and get the job done.“ That means that if there are no objections from Republicans, the Senate could clear the bill without a formal roll call vote. Parliamentarily, that is the fastest way to move something on the floor. A senior GOP source told Fox News contributor and Townhall.com editor Guy Benson that the move was a face-saving exercise by Schumer, and that he was trying to ""take credit"" for a GOP bill that he filibustered for ""small ball"" alterations. Democrats, the source said, couldn't drag the situation out much longer; economic conditions have worsened dramatically, and President Trump's approval rating has risen. McConnell said the Senate will meet at noon on Wednesday, but did not set a time for a vote. By rule, the procedural vote to begin debate on the coronavirus package would happen at 1 p.m. ET, unless the Senate scraps that vote‬. HERE'S WHAT PELOSI WANTED: ARTS FUNDING, UNION HELP, CLIMATE CHANGE PROVISIONS AND MORE “Democrats are finally taking ‘yes’ for an answer,"" McConnell said in his remarks on the Senate floor early Wednesday morning. ""Help is on the way.” “After days of intense discussions, the Senate has reached a bipartisan agreement on a historic relief package for this pandemic,” he continued. “It will rush new resources onto the front lines of our nation's health care fight. And it will inject trillions of dollars of cash into the economy as fast as possible to help Americans workers, families, small businesses and industries make it through this disruption and emerge on the other side ready to soar."" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who was smiling after McConnell left the floor, told reporters: ""This is a very important bipartisan piece of legislation that is going to be very important to help American workers, American business and people across America. So, we couldn't be more pleased. I've spoken to the president, many times today, and he's very pleased with this legislation, and the impact that this is going to have."" Concerning the House, Mnuchin remarked, ""I can't speak for the Speaker. I hope she takes it up and she passes as-is. We need, we need this to get working for the American people. And, again, there are a lot of compromises. It's a terrific bill, and it was a great accomplishment on everyone."" In a statement Wednesday morning, Pelosi said that ""House Democrats will now review the final provisions and legislative text of the agreement to determine a course of action.”       Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, left, accompanied by White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland and acting White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, speaks with reporters as he walks to the offices of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky. on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, March 24, 2020. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)       “This bipartisan legislation takes us a long way down the road in meeting the needs of the American people,"" she wrote. ""While the compromise does not go as far as our Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act, thanks to the unity and insistence of Senate and House Democrats, the bill has moved a great deal closer to America’s workers."" However, Michigan independent Rep. Justin Amash, who recently left the Republican Party, signaled that he might essentially delay consideration of the bill in the House. The lower chamber may seek to pass the legislation via unanimous consent because many members are not in Washington -- but a single member can ruin that plan. The House used unanimous consent during the 1918 flu pandemic as well. DEMS FUME AS TRUMP SAYS COUNTRY MAY BE REOPENED BY EASTER ""This bipartisan deal is a raw deal for the people,"" Amash tweeted. ""It does far too little for those who need the most help, while providing hundreds of billions in corporate welfare, massively growing government, inhibiting economic adaptation, and widening the gap between the rich and the poor."" The deal came hours after President Trump's top economic adviser said an unprecedented $6 trillion stimulus plan was imminent, including $4 trillion in liquidity from the Federal Reserve and $2 trillion in new money from Congress. Tensions then abruptly ratcheted back up again on Capitol Hill Tuesday night -- with Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham and Steve Daines taking to the Senate floor and calling for an end to negotiations because, as Graham put it, Democrats were ""nickel-and-diming at a time when people are dying -- literally dying.""

But, the Republicans said late Tuesday, Democrats were still seeking new payouts that were delaying a vote on a final bill. ""In case you're watching,"" Graham said in reference to the president, his voice rising, ""tell [Treasury Secretary] Steven Mnuchin to come back to the White House and end negotiations.

"                          The coronavirus crisis stands to do damage to the U.S. economy and job market with the potential to send the U.S. unemployment rate much higher; Fox Business correspondent Susan Li reports. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. On early Wednesday morning, Senate Democrats, Senate Republicans and the White House came to an agreement on a $2 trillion economic stimulus package meant to combat the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic, setting the measure up for a likely vote in the Senate and potential enactment later this week. Leaders from both parties focused on ensuring that the bill, at least in part, targeted average Americans dealing with hardship related to the widespread economic slowdown resulting from stay-at-home orders and social distancing guidelines meant to stem the spread of the pandemic in the United States. One of those measures beefs up unemployment insurance in an effort to ease the sting on workers who are getting laid off because their businesses are closed. Here's how the proposal, which Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called ""unemployment insurance on steroids"" early Wednesday, will work if signed into law by President Trump.

(Senate Television via AP)       WHITE HOUSE, SENATE STRIKE DEAL ON HISTORIC $2T CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL, BUT HOUSE SUPPORT REMAINS UNCERTAIN Time The Senate bill, if enacted, would give Americans four months of unemployment insurance, an increase from the current three months. Schumer said the change ""ensures that laid-off workers, on average, will receive their full pay for four months."" Businesses Schumer also indicated that the unemployment insurance expansion would not just cover individuals who fall under the typical definition of an employee. ""It ensures that all workers are protected whether they work for businesses small, medium or large, along with self-employed and workers in the gig economy,"" Schumer said on Wednesday morning, Because the final text of the bill has not been released yet, it is unclear how exactly the unemployment benefits will apply to non-traditional workers or if they would get benefits the same exact way as typical employees under the Senate's scheme. Money Workers who file for unemployment will be able to receive up to $600 per week more than what is currently on the books. This is likely to help Americans who may make more money in their jobs – and thus may have higher expenses – but are temporarily unable to work due to the coronavirus. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sunset Schumer seemed to indicate that the ""unemployment insurance on steroids"" would be rolled back as soon as the coronavirus pandemic is not a threat to Americans. ""Because Democrats insisted on these changes, the assistance to working Americans is not just a one-shot deal, but a paycheck every work period that will go on for as long as the crisis lasts,"" Schumer said. ""We are giving America’s workers some peace of mind, knowing that they will continue to have an income, and it will be there until we defeat this horrible virus.""

"                          At last we have a deal, announces Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell; congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. The White House and Senate leaders reached a breakthrough deal shortly after midnight Wednesday on a massive and historic $2 trillion coronavirus relief package for workers and businesses, capping days of heated negotiations that had nearly been derailed by last-minute demands from House Democrats. Later Wednesday morning, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., offered something of a tepid endorsement of the agreement after previously pushing for her own legislation. “Ladies and gentleman, we are done,"" White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland announced as he left the office of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., near midnight. ""We have a deal."" Ueland told reporters that ""much of the work on bill text has been completed, and I’m hopeful over the next few hours we’ll finish what's left and we will circulate it early in the morning.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the bill amounts to “unemployment compensation on steroids,"" and that Americans who have been laid off will have their missed salary remunerated. The package will enable companies to stay afloat and immediately bring back those employees when things are safe‬, Schumer said. The unprecedented economic rescue package would give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines, given that Democrats wanted them to abide by new carbon emissions restrictions. Hospitals would get significant help as well. In a letter to his colleagues, Schumer remarked, “Democrats are ready to give our unanimous consent to speed up the consideration of the bill and get the job done.“ That means that if there are no objections from Republicans, the Senate could clear the bill without a formal roll call vote. Parliamentarily, that is the fastest way to move something on the floor. A senior GOP source told Fox News contributor and Townhall.com editor Guy Benson that the move was a face-saving exercise by Schumer, and that he was trying to ""take credit"" for a GOP bill that he filibustered for ""small ball"" alterations. Democrats, the source said, couldn't drag the situation out much longer; economic conditions have worsened dramatically, and President Trump's approval rating has risen.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)       McConnell said the Senate will meet at 12 p.m. ET on Wednesday, but did not set a time for a vote. By rule, the procedural vote to begin debate on the coronavirus package would happen at 1 p.m. ET, unless the Senate scraps that vote‬. “Democrats are finally taking ‘yes’ for an answer,"" McConnell said in his remarks on the Senate floor early Wednesday morning. ""Help is on the way.” “After days of intense discussions, the Senate has reached a bipartisan agreement on a historic relief package for this pandemic,” he continued. “It will rush new resources onto the front lines of our nation's health care fight. And it will inject trillions of dollars of cash into the economy as fast as possible to help Americans workers, families, small businesses and industries make it through this disruption and emerge on the other side ready to soar."" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who was smiling after McConnell left the floor, told reporters: ""This is a very important bipartisan piece of legislation that is going to be very important to help American workers, American business and people across America. So, we couldn't be more pleased. I've spoken to the president, many times today, and he's very pleased with this legislation, and the impact that this is going to have."" Concerning the House, Mnuchin remarked, ""I can't speak for the Speaker. I hope she takes it up and she passes as-is. We need, we need this to get working for the American people. And, again, there are a lot of compromises. It's terrific bill, and it was a great accomplishment on everyone."" In a statement Wednesday morning, Pelosi said that ""House Democrats will now review the final provisions and legislative text of the agreement to determine a course of action.” “This bipartisan legislation takes us a long way down the road in meeting the needs of the American people,"" she wrote. ""While the compromise does not go as far as our Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act, thanks to the unity and insistence of Senate and House Democrats, the bill has moved a great deal closer to America’s workers.""       Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, left, accompanied by White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland and acting White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, speaks with reporters as he walks to the offices of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky. on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, March 24, 2020. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)       However, Mnuchin spoke, Michigan independent Rep. Justin Amash, who recently left the Republican Party, signaled that he might essentially delay consideration of the bill in the House. The lower chamber may seek to pass the legislation via unanimous consent because many members are not in Washington -- but a single member can ruin that plan. The House used unanimous consent during the 1918 flu pandemic as well. ""This bipartisan deal is a raw deal for the people,"" Amash tweeted. ""It does far too little for those who need the most help, while providing hundreds of billions in corporate welfare, massively growing government, inhibiting economic adaptation, and widening the gap between the rich and the poor."" DEMS FUME AS TRUMP SAYS COUNTRY MAY BE REOPENED BY EASTER The deal came hours after President Trump's top economic adviser said an unprecedented $6 trillion stimulus plan was imminent, including $4 trillion in liquidity from the Federal Reserve and $2 trillion in new money from Congress. Tensions then abruptly ratcheted back up again on Capitol Hill Tuesday night -- with Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham and Steve Daines taking to the Senate floor and calling for an end to negotiations because, as Graham put it, Democrats were ""nickel-and-diming at a time when people are dying -- literally dying."" Graham and Daines' late-night push for an immediate vote on a stimulus bill came after tensions seemingly had cooled in Congress during the day, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its highest point gain in its history as leaders from both parties signaled that an agreement could be within reach. Shares advanced in Asia on Wednesday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged to its best day since 1933 as Congress and the White House neared a deal. Japan's Nikkei 225 index jumped 5.3 percent, while Hong Kong added 3 percent and Sydney climbed 3.6 percent. Markets across Asia were all up more than 2 percent. ""Ladies and gentleman, we are done. We have a deal."" But, the Republicans said late Tuesday, Democrats were still seeking new payouts that were delaying a vote on a final bill. ""In case you're watching,"" Graham said in reference to the president, his voice rising, ""tell [Treasury Secretary] Steven Mnuchin to come back to the White House and end negotiations. I think I understand the give-and-take of life and politics, but I've been called by two good friends on the Democratic side in the last five or six hours wanting more money. End the negotiations."" He added: ""This bill is $2 trillion. There's a ton of money in this bill for people who need it, but what we're doing now is, every special-interest group in town is trying to get a little bit more."" “Listen, we were told we are at the one-yard line last night to get this done,"" Daines, who led the colloquy with Graham, said from the Senate floor. ""All I’ve got to say is, the Senate may think it’s at the one-yard line right now, but Montanans are getting sacked. In fact, our unemployment claims in Montana since march 17th, we just looked it up 15 minutes ago, 14,350 Montanans have filed for unemployment in the last week.” Monday had been marked with furious debate on the Senate floor, as Republicans accused House Democrats of proposing an alternative stimulus bill that was full of unnecessary progressive wishlist items. Senate Democrats in the meantime repeatedly blocked the Republican stimulus bill, which would require 60 votes to survive. The bill offered by Pelosi had included measures to restrict airlines' carbon emissions, protect illegal immigrants, provide for same-day voter registration, pay off billions in student loan debt, encourage federal agencies to employ ""minority banks,"" bail out the U.S. Postal Service and even fund the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. WATCH DAINES' FULL SPEECH ON THE SENATE FLOOR ""There is a whole concern in our country that if we're giving tens of billions of dollars to the airlines, that we could at least have a shared value about what happens to the environment,"" Pelosi said Tuesday. But, support for Democrats' climate-change push in the stimulus bill withered Tuesday. The former chief of staff to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Saikat Chakrabarti, wrote on Twitter in response to Pelosi's comments: ""I helped write the #GreenNewDeal and I think this is ridiculous. The tiny little emissions standard increase doesn’t even do anything meaningful to stave off climate change and gives the @GOP  leverage to get rid of real help for working people. Solve the problem at hand. Hospitals would get significant help as well."" Republicans, including the president, have called the measures irrelevant ""nonsense"" and total nonstarters. After Democrats signaled they might be willing to negotiate away some of their proposals, though, the Dow surged and lawmakers appeared optimistic. Democrats have argued the GOP package would do too much for large corporations and not enough for workers, and inaccurately suggested that the treasury secretary would have unilateral control over a massive ""slush fund."" WHAT'S IN PELOSI'S CORONAVIRUS BILL? ARTS FUNDING, CLIMATE CHANGE WISHLIST, AND MORE ""This is ridiculous,"" Graham continued Tuesday night. ""Steven Mnuchin has done a good job. I appreciate his efforts to negotiate a bill that will help America. Senator [Mitch] McConnell says we're on the two-yard line. I believe the problem is that there are 20 people playing defense, and we need to take some people off the field. What bothers me is that at that late hour, I'm still getting calls from people wanting more money.""       President Trump with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, during a briefing at the White House on Tuesday. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)       Graham and Daines' frustration was matched by many of his colleagues. Louisiana GOP Sen. John Kennedy told Fox News' Sean Hannity late Tuesday that while the coronavirus ""can kill you,"" so can ""hunger."" Shortly before Graham and Daines spoke, Trump declared at a coronovirus task force briefing that the country was nearing ""the end of our historic battle"" with ""the invisible enemy"" of coronavirus. Trump's approval numbers hit their highest point ever this week, with 60 percent of Americans approving of his coronavirus response efforts. WATCH: TRUMP SAYS CORONAVIRUS SHUTDOWN MAY BE OVER BY EASTER The president also sounded an unexpectedly magnanimous note: ""I also want to thank Congress, because whether or not we're happy that they haven't quite gotten there yet, they have been working long hours. I'm talking Republicans and Democrats, all of them, the House, the Senate. I want to thank Congress because they are really trying to get there, and I think they will."" Then, Director of the U.S. National Economic Council Larry Kudlow specifically said the new coronavirus bill working its way through congressional gridlock would total $6 trillion: $4 trillion in liquidity from the Federal Reserve and $2 trillion in new money. Typical annual appropriations from Congress in a given fiscal year are around $1.2-4 trillion, with total expenditures roughly $4.3 trillion. “This package will be the single largest Main Street assistance program in the history of the United States,” Kudlow said, adding that negotiations would continue into the evening but that a vote was imminent. Meanwhile, there was some good news inside the White House grounds. As the briefing concluded, White House press Secretary Stephanie Grisham, who has been quarantined since coming in contact with Brazilian officials almost two weeks ago and working from home, revealed she has received negative COVID-19 test results and will be back to work Wednesday. Grisham will return as the Trump administration increasingly has sought to project optimism. The president, who tweeted Sunday that ""WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF,"" declared at the Fox News virtual town hall that he ""would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi signaled tepid support Wednesday for the Senate’s multitrillion-dollar coronavirus response package, saying the bipartisan deal has moved from “corporations-focused to workers-first” and her colleagues will review the plan. The statement came as draft text of the sprawling, $2 trillion plan emerged, with the Senate barreling toward a likely vote sometime Wednesday after two failed attempts on the original version of the legislation earlier in the week. WHITE HOUSE, SENATE STRIKE DEAL ON CORONAVIRUS BILL Senate lawmakers and Trump administration officials negotiated late into the night to reach a deal. But even if it passes the upper chamber, support in the Democrat-controlled House is key. Pelosi had scrambled talks by pursuing a separate House bill that contained provisions Republicans decried as extraneous and political in nature. In a written statement, Pelosi indicated, however, she is open to the latest Senate version. “America is facing a grave health crisis with a serious impact on our economy. I salute the strong leadership of Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats,” she said Wednesday. “I especially thank our House Democratic Committee Chairmen, who worked hard to move the Republican proposal from corporations-focused to workers-first and who will now review the legislative text of this agreement with our Caucus.” Pelosi went on to say that the original Senate GOP legislation, which was blocked by Democrats twice in the Senate, “was a non-starter.” “This bipartisan legislation takes us a long way down the road in meeting the needs of the American people,” Pelosi said. The speaker went on to say that the new package “does not go as far” as the bill she and House Democrats proposed on Monday, but that “due to the unity and insistence of Senate and House Democrats, the bill has moved a great deal closer to America’s workers.” HOW SENATE BILL BOOSTS UNEMPLOYMENT AID It remains unclear whether Pelosi's caucus will get on board with the bill, or whether any last-minute hurdles will emerge on the Senate side, as lawmakers say they want to send relief to Americans dealing with the economic fallout from the pandemic immediately. The House has adjourned and is not expected to meet again until late Thursday morning. Democrats had claimed the earlier Senate bill did too much for large corporations and didn’t do enough for workers. Upon reaching an agreement with Republicans and the White House, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the bill amounts to “unemployment compensation on steroids,"" and that every American who is laid off will have their missed salary remunerated. That provision will enable companies to stay afloat and immediately bring back those employees when things are safe, Schumer said. Democrats said the package specifically would help replace the salaries of furloughed workers for four months, rather than the three months first proposed. Furloughed workers would get whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment, plus a $600 per week add-on, with gig workers like Uber drivers covered for the first time. The package also would give one-time payments of $1,200 per adult and $500 per child directly to the public. The massive economic relief package would provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines, given that Democrats wanted them to abide by new carbon emissions restrictions. Republicans also won inclusion of an ""employee retention"" tax credit that's estimated to provide $50 billion to companies that retain employees on payroll and cover 50 percent of workers' paychecks. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2 percent Social Security payroll tax. Other provisions in a related package, according to a summary, include $100 billion for direct aid to health care institutions battling the crisis; more than $4 billion to health agencies; $200 million to help nursing homes cope with the challenge; $45 billion for FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund and millions more for FEMA grants; and $400 million in election assistance to help states expand early voting and vote-by-mail options. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Republicans would meet at noon on Wednesday, but did not set a time for a vote. “Democrats are finally taking ‘yes’ for an answer,"" McConnell said in his remarks on the Senate floor early Wednesday morning. ""Help is on the way.” “After days of intense discussions, the Senate has reached a bipartisan agreement on a historic relief package for this pandemic,” he continued. “It will rush new resources onto the front lines of our nation's health care fight.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. A class-action lawsuit filed in Florida this month seeks to ""make China pay for what they've done"" in its handling of the coronavirus crisis, saying the country acted ""negligently in their handling of the COVID-19 outbreak."" A personal injury law firm based in Boca Raton, Fla., is bringing the suit against China and various Chinese government agencies on behalf of ""individuals and business owners in the United States and State of Florida, for damages suffered as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic."" The suit claims China ""knew that COVID-19 was dangerous and capable of causing a pandemic, yet slowly acted, proverbially put their head in the sand, and/or covered it up in their own economic self-interest."" ""This is an undertaking against a world superpower who has the ability to pay for what they've done,"" Jeremy Alters, the chief strategist and non-attorney spokesperson for the Berman Law Group, the class-action firm backing the suit, told Fox News. ""They have the money to pay for what they've done, and we should all together make China pay for what they've done,"" he said. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW Berman Complaint Against China by Fox News on Scribd WHITE HOUSE, SENATE STRIKE DEAL ON HISTORIC $2T CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL, BUT HOUSE SUPPORT REMAINS UNCERTAIN The original complaint has just a handful of named plaintiffs but the lawyers familiar with the case at Berman Law Group say they plan to file an amended complaint at some point with significantly more plaintiffs, including individuals who have gotten sick because of the coronavirus. The lawsuit does not name a specific dollar amount being sought from China, asking for ""compensatory and other damages to Plaintiffs and the Class Members, for their economic and non-economic damages ... to the full extent permitted by the law."" Alters, however, made clear that though lawyers for Berman would be seeking potentially ""tens of trillions"" from the communist nation, the suit was largely about the symbolism of forcing China to defend its actions in American courts. ""We want the court to make them pay for what they've done,"" Alters said. ""They have unleashed ... a massive pandemic on the world. It appears they knew about it long before they gave information about it to the rest of the world. We want our courts to say, 'China, you are going to be held accountable here in our courts because you have harmed hundreds of millions of Americans.'"" The suit also has the potential, according to its backers, to bring to light documents and other information about the coronavirus that China may still be withholding from other governments and health experts worldwide. This class-action suit is not the only one filed against China over the coronavirus, but it is the main serious complaint. The D.C.-based far-right organization Freedom Watch filed a $20 trillion suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas accusing the Chinese of creating the coronavirus as a bioweapon — an allegation that has been debunked. The Florida-based suit, however, seeks damages based on the Chinese government's negligence in containing the coronavirus after it first was transmitted from animals to humans, an allegation with a large amount of supporting evidence.       Residents wearing face masks purchase seafood at a wet market on Jan. 28 in Macau, China.      (Getty Images) THE CORONAVIRUS DID NOT ESCAPE FROM A LAB: HERE'S HOW WE KNOW This is made difficult, however, by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) which prevents Americans from suing other countries except under specific circumstances. The plaintiffs claim they fit under the exceptions for commercial activity and ""personal injury or death"" that stems from ""the tortious act or omission of that foreign state or of any official or employee of that foreign state while acting within the scope of his office or employment."" Yale law professor Stephen L. Carter, however, argued in a Bloomberg column Tuesday that the Florida suit's claims don't fall under the FSIA exceptions. ""The Florida class action suit asserts that the exception for commercial activities applies, but it’s not easy to see how,"" Carter writes. Carter also notes that the second exemption the Florida plaintiffs claim ""specifically bars any claim 'based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function regardless of whether the discretion be abused.' It’s hard to find a way around this restriction."" But Alters says China's negligence in its response to the coronavirus should fall under the exceptions to FSIA because of how egregious it is. ""There is a lengthy history of precedent for bringing foreign nations to our courts for their bad acts that affect Americans,"" he said Tuesday. ""I don't know in history whether there has been another bad act like this that has affected this many Americans at once, where the entire economy is basically at a standstill and 14 states are now in a stay-at-home order."" The Florida suit against China also is important, according to its backers, because of the collaboration between two very different firms working the case.

Alters, a spokesman for Berman, is a veteran of both Obama presidential campaigns and the 2004 John Kerry presidential campaign. The lobbying and public relations firm working on the case, Lucas Compton, is closer to the right side of the aisle. George Sorial is a partner at Lucas Compton and worked in the Trump Organization for several years before leaving the company to become a campaign surrogate for the now-president.

They are who they are, we are who we are, but this transcends politics. ... This is a nonpolitical bipartisan effort on behalf of the United States citizenry. It's almost a patriotic thing to hold that country accountable."" Beyond the FSIA difficulties, another likely weakness in the case is the fact that it treats the idea that the coronavirus potentially came from a lab -- which has been debunked -- as a legitimate ""alternative theory."" This could potentially undermine the majority of its case, which pushes the widely understood story that the virus was transmitted from an animal to a human at a wild animal market in the city of Wuhan before China responded to the health threat with obfuscation and censorship. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Responding to a question about the inclusion of the manmade virus theory in their lawsuit, Alters said the presence of a high-security bio-agent lab in Wuhan ""cannot be ignored."" ""[The Wuhan Institute of Virology] handles the most dangerous viruses,"" he said. ""It resides in the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan. In that lab they cultivate viruses from exotic animals. The wet markets were supposed to be shut down years ago and the Chinese government turned a blind eye to the ongoing operations. This is not coincidental. They also knew of the active and routine trade of these exotic animals which harbor these viruses. The Chinese government has allowed the sale, exchange and consumption of these animals by putting their head in the sand knowing of the dangers this presented locally and internationally.""

The United Nations on Wednesday announced a $2 billion global response package to fight the coronavirus pandemic in countries that leaders say may not have the resources themselves to combat the virus. “COVID-19 is menacing the whole of humanity and so the whole of humanity must fight back.

Despite multiple members of Congress calling for their respective chambers to implement remote voting procedures as both senators and House members have fallen ill due to the coronavirus, a report by the House Rules Committee obtained by Fox News indicates such an option may be far off. The report cites the Iowa caucuses fiasco caused by an app as well as a 2007 controversy caused by a combination of human error and a malfunction in the House's electronic voting system that ""spurred the creation of an investigative committee"" as just some of the reasons not to rush to create a system for members to vote remotely. ""A rule change of this magnitude would also be one of the biggest rule changes in the last century, in one of the most critical institutions in our country,"" the report says. ""This change cannot be implemented overnight, and likely cannot be accomplished in time to address the current crisis. Without complete consensus, which we do not currently have, it would also require us to come back to Washington to vote to change House rules to allow for remote voting."" The report also mentions the potential of constitutional challenges to legislation passed by remote vote in the House; the risk that foreign enemies might attempt to attack that system to paralyze the House of Representatives in a crisis; the chance a member may have an issue connecting to the system and more as arguments against trying to immediately set up remote voting for House members during the coronavirus pandemic. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW CONGRESS WEIGHS REMOTE VOTING IN WAKE OF TWO LAWMAKERS TESTING POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS Members of both the House of Representatives and the Senate have fallen sick due to coronavirus, which causes a disease known officially as COVID-19. Rep. Ben McAdams, D-Utah, was even admitted to a hospital due to ""severe shortness of breath"" caused by the flu-like sickness. Fears about spreading the coronavirus among members and congressional staffs, as well as families of members and staffs, led Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, as well as Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., to push for voting rules changes in their respective chambers last week. Portman and Durbin introduced a resolution in the Senate asking for a rule change to permit remote voting in a crisis that could prevent members of Congress from being physically present in the Capitol. Hoyer sent a letter to his Democratic colleagues in the House saying that he expected to ""adjust our voting procedures"" to follow expert recommendations for social distancing and limiting the size of gatherings. ""Why is it required that we be physically present on the floor closer to one another than perhaps we should be at this moment of a public health crisis?"" Durbin asked in floor remarks. PELOSI INDICATES POTENTIAL SUPPORT FOR SENATE'S NEW CORONAVIRUS BILL, AS DETAILS EMERGE ""In times of a national emergency, the Senate must be able to convene and act expeditiously even if we can’t be together in person,"" Portman said in a statement. ""While I know there is resistance to changing a Senate tradition to allow for remote voting during national emergencies, I believe this is an important issue and worthy of robust discussion among our Senate colleagues."" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., an old-fashioned Senate parliamentarian, panned the idea of remote voting last Tuesday, saying he would work to keep senators from spreading the coronavirus among each other ""without fundamentally changing Senate rules."" One of the ways he suggested to do so was to keep votes open for a longer period of time to limit the number of senators in the chamber at any one time while still allowing everyone to vote on legislation. That was one of the top recommendations in the House report. The Rules committee report also says advancing legislation by unanimous consent and voice votes is ""[b]y far the best option to use the existing House rules and current practices."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As long as no members object or bring a point of order challenging whether or not there is a quorum, the House could advance major bills on which there is bipartisan consensus with very few members in the chamber. There is also currently a House rule that allows the body to set a provisional quorum, allowing the body to reduce the number of members who must be present as long as the House spends 96 hours trying to get enough members to the floor. It has not been previously used, however, so a vote taken consistent with that rule, which was put into place as a response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, could be subject to a constitutional challenge. Paired voting, proxy voting and enhanced unanimous consent — a potential change in House rules which could allow measures to pass by unanimous consent as long as fewer than a specific number of members object — are also possible rules changes mentioned by the report.

"                          President Trump comments on the state of the 2020 summer games in Tokyo at the White House. President Trump congratulated Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the International Olympic Committee for their “very wise decision” to reschedule the summer olympics to 2021 amid the coronavirus pandemic. “Congratulations to Prime Minister Abe of Japan, and the IOC, and their very wise decision to present the Olympics in 2021,” Trump tweeted Wednesday. “It will be a great success and I look forward to being there!” OLYMPICS THAT HAVE BEEN CANCELED OR INTERRUPTED OVER THE YEARS The president’s tweet comes after Abe announced the change Tuesday. Abe said that he and IOC President Thomas Bach came to an agreement to postpone the Summer 2020 games, which were slated to begin on July 24, and that they will instead take place next summer in Japan. ""In the present circumstances and based on the information provided by the WHO today, the IOC President and the Prime Minister of Japan have concluded that the Games of the XXXII Olympiad in Tokyo must be rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021, to safeguard the health of the athletes, everybody involved in the Olympic Games and the international community,"" the IOC and Abe said in a joint statement. ""The leaders agreed that the Olympic Games in Tokyo could stand as a beacon of hope to the world during these troubled times and that the Olympic flame could become the light at the end of the tunnel in which the world finds itself at present,” they continued. “Therefore, it was agreed that the Olympic flame will stay in Japan. It was also agreed that the Games will keep the name Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020.” TOKYO OLYMPICS TO BE POSTPONED The decision comes as the world grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic. As of midday Wednesday, there were more than 448,000 positive cases around the world. More than 19,675 people have died from the coronavirus.

"                          Bernie Sanders denies reports he will suspend his campaign after Biden sweeps primaries; Biden campaign senior adviser Symone Sanders reacts. Joe Biden is making clear he’s not going to personally tell Sen. Bernie Sanders to end his White House bid. “It’s not for me to tell him to drop out,” the all but certain Democratic presidential nominee said in an interview Tuesday on ""The View."" “It’s up to Bernie to do what he wants to do,” he added. BIDEN'S  SHORTLIST OF POTENTIAL RUNNING MATES ISN'T THAT SHORT  But organized labor is giving the former vice president a helping hand – with four of the biggest unions in the country all endorsing him in the past 10 days. The National Education Association was first, on March 14. Then followed the United Food and Commercial Workers, the American Federation of Teachers, and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees followed. Biden’s sweeping victories last week in the Florida, Illinois and Arizona primaries cemented his status as the party’s likely nominee and all-but-destroyed Sanders’ slight chances of any comeback. But the two-time White House hopeful doesn’t appear to be ready to call it quits. SANDERS SET TO APPEAR ON STAGE IF THERE'S AN APRIL PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY DEBATE Sanders' campaign told The New York Times that if there’s a Democratic presidential primary debate in April, their candidate expects to participate.  “If there is a debate in April, he plans to be there,” the campaign confirmed to Fox News.  And earlier this week, the campaign spotlighted how it's ramping up organizing efforts in New York ahead of that state’s primary – which for now is still scheduled to take place on April 28. The senator’s campaign said last week that Sanders is “reassessing” his presidential bid. Sanders has stopped criticizing Biden and is no longer fundraising for his White House bid. But he’s remained very active – holding virtual campaign events to discuss the coronavirus pandemic and raise funds to benefit the response to the outbreak. But the optics of the flurry of major union endorsements in recent days is another setback for Sanders, a longtime friend to organized labor whose progressive political revolution is all about helping workers. United Food and Commercial Workers president March Perrone – in his statement backing Biden – emphasized that “at a time when UFCW members in healthcare, food retail, packing, and processing are on the front lines of the coronavirus outbreak, the vice president has again stood by our side by calling for paid leave and designating these brave workers as first responders.”  American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten told Politico that “Bernie has a real decision to make.” But the AFT told Fox News that Weingarten has not urged Sanders to drop out. A senior organized labor official told Fox News that “in a perfect world, it would be time for Sanders to get out of the race, but with the uncertainly of the primary calendar and this summer’s national convention due to the coronavirus, it makes sense for Sanders to not close down his campaign.”  The official, who asked for anonymity to speak more freely, said that Sanders “has a chance to put out a message every day. He keeps his message and his clout by not suspending his campaign.” The official added that there’s no building frustration from organized labor that’s directed at Sanders for staying in the race, but explained that “the frustration is on the attacks on Biden by some Sanders supporters. The last thing we need is the presumptive nominee being attacked by fellow Democrats.” Fox News' Andrew Craft, Madeleine Rivera, and Allie Raffa contributed to this story    ",         Unions go all-in for Biden as Sanders defies pressure to drop out,         2020-03-25T102908-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/unions-go-all-in-for-biden-as-sanders-defies-pressure-to-drop-out,Fox
"                          At last we have a deal, announces Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell; congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. White House and Senate leaders reached a historic deal shortly after midnight Wednesday on a massive $2 trillion coronavirus relief package for workers and businesses, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi offered something of a tepid endorsement of the agreement after previously pushing for her own legislation. The bipartisan breakthrough in the Senate capped days of heated negotiations that had nearly been derailed by last-minute demands from House Democrats. “Ladies and gentleman, we are done,"" White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland announced as he left the office of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., near midnight. ""We have a deal."" Ueland told reporters that ""much of the work on bill text has been completed, and I’m hopeful over the next few hours we’ll finish what's left and we will circulate it early in the morning.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the bill amounts to “unemployment compensation on steroids,"" and that Americans who have been laid off will have their missed salary remunerated. The package will enable companies to stay afloat and immediately bring back those employees when things are safe‬, Schumer said. Democrats said the package specifically would help replace the salaries of furloughed workers for four months, rather than the three months first proposed. Furloughed workers would get whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment, plus a $600 per week add-on, with gig workers like Uber drivers covered for the first time. The package also would give one-time payments of $1,200 per adult and $500 per child directly to the public. Although 2019 tax returns would be used to determine income (or 2018 tax returns if those are the most recent available), experts said it was likely the bill would contain provisions for those who do not file returns. The massive economic relief package would provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines, given that Democrats wanted them to abide by new carbon emissions restrictions. Republicans also won inclusion of an ""employee retention"" tax credit that's estimated to provide $50 billion to companies that retain employees on payroll and cover 50 percent of workers' paychecks. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2 percent Social Security payroll tax.       Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky. walks to the Senate chamber on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, March 24, 2020. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)       Other provisions, according to a summary, include $100 billion for direct aid to health care institutions battling the crisis; more than $4 billion to health agencies; $200 million to help nursing homes cope with the challenge; $45 billion for FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund and millions more for FEMA grants; and $400 million in election assistance to help states expand early voting and vote-by-mail options. The breakthrough came as support for Pelosi's climate-change push in the stimulus bill withered Tuesday. The former chief of staff to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Saikat Chakrabarti, wrote on Twitter: ""I helped write the #GreenNewDeal and I think this is ridiculous. The tiny little emissions standard increase doesn’t even do anything meaningful to stave off climate change and gives the @GOP  leverage to get rid of real help for working people. Solve the problem at hand. Hospitals would get significant help as well."" In a letter to his colleagues, Schumer remarked, “Democrats are ready to give our unanimous consent to speed up the consideration of the bill and get the job done.“ That means that if there are no objections from Republicans, the Senate could clear the bill without a formal roll call vote. Parliamentarily, that is the fastest way to move something on the floor. A senior GOP source told Fox News contributor and Townhall.com editor Guy Benson that the move was a face-saving exercise by Schumer, and that he was trying to ""take credit"" for a GOP bill that he filibustered for ""small ball"" alterations. Democrats, the source said, couldn't drag the situation out much longer; economic conditions have worsened dramatically, and President Trump's approval rating has risen. A senior Republican aide separately told Fox News: ""Reading Chuck Schumer's list, I half expected that the next thing I read would be the Minority Leader taking credit for inventing fire. The reality is that almost every significant 'win' he's taking credit for, is actually a Senate Republican idea."" Republicans had ""never objected"" to more hospital funding, or that oversight of the stimulus stabilization fund ""be structured almost exactly like TARP oversight,"" the aide went on. And Republicans were the first to push for three months of unemployment insurance and ""did not oppose adding a fourth."" ""Virtually all of the main policy features that Senator Schumer describes as 'unemployment insurance on steroids' were ideas that took shape during the bipartisan weekend working group phase and which were included in the Sunday bill that Democrats blocked twice,"" the aide said. ""The only truly material change on unemployment during the Democrats‘ obstruction was the change from three months to four, something that could’ve easily been plussed up during the 30 hours of post-cloture time."" ""To sum up, Senator Schumer delayed life-saving aid to medical professionals and significant relief for families and small businesses in order to claim credit for wins that are either bipartisan or Republican ideas,"" the aide concluded. ""Stay tuned for all the unrelated wish list items Congressional Democrats demanded and Republicans stopped."" McConnell said the Senate will meet at noon on Wednesday, but did not set a time for a vote. By rule, the procedural vote to begin debate on the coronavirus package would happen at 1 p.m. ET, unless the Senate scraps that vote‬. “Democrats are finally taking ‘yes’ for an answer,"" McConnell said in his remarks on the Senate floor early Wednesday morning. ""Help is on the way.” “After days of intense discussions, the Senate has reached a bipartisan agreement on a historic relief package for this pandemic,” he continued. “It will rush new resources onto the front lines of our nation's health care fight. And it will inject trillions of dollars of cash into the economy as fast as possible to help Americans workers, families, small businesses and industries make it through this disruption and emerge on the other side ready to soar."" HERE'S WHAT PELOSI WANTED: ARTS FUNDING, UNION HELP, CLIMATE CHANGE PROVISIONS AND MORE Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who was smiling after McConnell left the floor, told reporters: ""This is a very important bipartisan piece of legislation that is going to be very important to help American workers, American business and people across America. So, we couldn't be more pleased. I've spoken to the president, many times today, and he's very pleased with this legislation, and the impact that this is going to have."" Concerning the House, Mnuchin remarked, ""I can't speak for the Speaker. I hope she takes it up and she passes as-is. We need, we need this to get working for the American people. And, again, there are a lot of compromises. It's a terrific bill, and it was a great accomplishment on everyone."" In a statement Wednesday morning, Pelosi said that ""House Democrats will now review the final provisions and legislative text of the agreement to determine a course of action.”       Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, left, accompanied by White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland and acting White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, speaks with reporters as he walks to the offices of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky. on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, March 24, 2020. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)       “This bipartisan legislation takes us a long way down the road in meeting the needs of the American people,"" she wrote. ""While the compromise does not go as far as our Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act, thanks to the unity and insistence of Senate and House Democrats, the bill has moved a great deal closer to America’s workers."" Later, Pelosi told reporters, ""We’re reviewing it now. We have a staff and our chairman reviewing the bill. We're optimistic but we’ll see."" Regardless, the House will not pass coronavirus bill on Wednesday. The chamber was quickly gaveled in and gaveled out. Senior sources tell Fox News House won’t meet again later today, and will convene Thursday at 11 a.m. ET. Meanwhile, Michigan independent Rep. Justin Amash, who recently left the Republican Party, signaled that he might essentially delay consideration of the bill in the House. The lower chamber may seek to pass the legislation via unanimous consent because many members are not in Washington -- but a single member can ruin that plan. The House used unanimous consent during the 1918 flu pandemic as well. DEMS FUME AS TRUMP SAYS COUNTRY MAY BE REOPENED BY EASTER ""We're optimistic, but we’ll see."" ""This bipartisan deal is a raw deal for the people,"" Amash tweeted. ""It does far too little for those who need the most help, while providing hundreds of billions in corporate welfare, massively growing government, inhibiting economic adaptation, and widening the gap between the rich and the poor."" The deal came hours after President Trump's top economic adviser said an unprecedented $6 trillion stimulus plan was imminent, including $4 trillion in liquidity from the Federal Reserve and $2 trillion in new money from Congress. Tensions then abruptly ratcheted back up again on Capitol Hill Tuesday night -- with Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham and Steve Daines taking to the Senate floor and calling for an end to negotiations because, as Graham put it, Democrats were ""nickel-and-diming at a time when people are dying -- literally dying."" Graham and Daines' late-night push for an immediate vote on a stimulus bill came after tensions seemingly had cooled in Congress during the day, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its highest point gain in its history as leaders from both parties signaled that an agreement could be within reach. Shares advanced in Asia on Wednesday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged to its best day since 1933 as Congress and the White House neared a deal. Japan's Nikkei 225 index jumped 5.3 percent, while Hong Kong added 3 percent and Sydney climbed 3.6 percent. Markets across Asia were all up more than 2 percent. But, the Republicans said late Tuesday, Democrats were still seeking new payouts that were delaying a vote on a final bill. ""In case you're watching,"" Graham said in reference to the president, his voice rising, ""tell [Treasury Secretary] Steven Mnuchin to come back to the White House and end negotiations. I think I understand the give-and-take of life and politics, but I've been called by two good friends on the Democratic side in the last five or six hours wanting more money. End the negotiations."" He added: ""This bill is $2 trillion. There's a ton of money in this bill for people who need it, but what we're doing now is, every special-interest group in town is trying to get a little bit more."" “Listen, we were told we are at the one-yard line last night to get this done,"" Daines, who led the colloquy with Graham, said from the Senate floor. ""All I’ve got to say is, the Senate may think it’s at the one-yard line right now, but Montanans are getting sacked. In fact, our unemployment claims in Montana since march 17th, we just looked it up 15 minutes ago, 14,350 Montanans have filed for unemployment in the last week.” Shortly before Graham and Daines spoke, Trump declared at a coronovirus task force briefing that the country was nearing ""the end of our historic battle"" with ""the invisible enemy"" of coronavirus. Trump's approval numbers hit their highest point ever this week, with 60 percent of Americans approving of his coronavirus response efforts. WATCH: TRUMP SAYS CORONAVIRUS SHUTDOWN MAY BE OVER BY EASTER The president also sounded an unexpectedly magnanimous note: ""I also want to thank Congress, because whether or not we're happy that they haven't quite gotten there yet, they have been working long hours. I'm talking Republicans and Democrats, all of them, the House, the Senate. I want to thank Congress because they are really trying to get there, and I think they will."" Then, Director of the U.S. National Economic Council Larry Kudlow specifically said the new coronavirus bill working its way through congressional gridlock would total $6 trillion: $4 trillion in liquidity from the Federal Reserve and $2 trillion in new money. Typical annual appropriations from Congress in a given fiscal year are around $1.2-4 trillion, with total expenditures roughly $4.3 trillion. “This package will be the single largest Main Street assistance program in the history of the United States,” Kudlow said, adding that negotiations would continue into the evening but that a vote was imminent. Meanwhile, there was some good news inside the White House grounds. As the briefing concluded, White House press Secretary Stephanie Grisham, who has been quarantined since coming in contact with Brazilian officials almost two weeks ago and working from home, revealed she has received negative COVID-19 test results and will be back to work Wednesday. Grisham will return as the Trump administration increasingly has sought to project optimism. The president, who tweeted Sunday that ""WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF,"" declared at the Fox News virtual town hall that he ""would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter.""       Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, center, on his way to the offices of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)       Pressed by Fox News' John Roberts on the timeline, Trump said at the briefing: ""We'll be looking at a lot of things -- we'll also be looking at very large portions of our country, but I'll be guided very much by Dr. [Anthony] Fauci, and by Deborah [Birx]."" Fauci, the longtime head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, whose absence from recent coronavirus briefings triggered a wave of speculation in the media, said the timeline was still ""flexible."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Democrats have reacted furiously to Trump's new timeline for relaxing economic restrictions, with Hillary Clinton suggesting people would ""needlessly die,"" and Joe Biden accusing Trump of spreading ""misinformation.""

""To sum up, Senator Schumer delayed life-saving aid to medical professionals and significant relief for families and small businesses in order to claim credit for wins that are either bipartisan or Republican ideas,"" the aide concluded. ""Stay tuned for all the unrelated wish list items Congressional Democrats demanded and Republicans stopped."" McConnell said the Senate will meet at 12 p.m. ET on Wednesday, but did not set a time for a vote. By rule, the procedural vote to begin debate on the coronavirus package would happen at 1 p.m. ET, unless the Senate scraps that vote‬. “Democrats are finally taking ‘yes’ for an answer,"" McConnell said in his remarks on the Senate floor early Wednesday morning. ""Help is on the way.” “After days of intense discussions, the Senate has reached a bipartisan agreement on a historic relief package for this pandemic,” he continued. “It will rush new resources onto the front lines of our nation's health care fight. And it will inject trillions of dollars of cash into the economy as fast as possible to help Americans workers, families, small businesses and industries make it through this disruption and emerge on the other side ready to soar."" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who was smiling after McConnell left the floor, told reporters: ""This is a very important bipartisan piece of legislation that is going to be very important to help American workers, American business and people across America. So, we couldn't be more pleased. I've spoken to the president, many times today, and he's very pleased with this legislation, and the impact that this is going to have."" Concerning the House, Mnuchin remarked, ""I can't speak for the Speaker. I hope she takes it up and she passes as-is. We need, we need this to get working for the American people. And, again, there are a lot of compromises. It's terrific bill, and it was a great accomplishment on everyone."" In a statement Wednesday morning, Pelosi said that ""House Democrats will now review the final provisions and legislative text of the agreement to determine a course of action.” “This bipartisan legislation takes us a long way down the road in meeting the needs of the American people,"" she wrote. ""While the compromise does not go as far as our Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act, thanks to the unity and insistence of Senate and House Democrats, the bill has moved a great deal closer to America’s workers.""       Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, left, accompanied by White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland and acting White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, speaks with reporters as he walks to the offices of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky. on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, March 24, 2020. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)       However, Mnuchin spoke, Michigan independent Rep. Justin Amash, who recently left the Republican Party, signaled that he might essentially delay consideration of the bill in the House. The lower chamber may seek to pass the legislation via unanimous consent because many members are not in Washington -- but a single member can ruin that plan. The House used unanimous consent during the 1918 flu pandemic as well. ""This bipartisan deal is a raw deal for the people,"" Amash tweeted. ""It does far too little for those who need the most help, while providing hundreds of billions in corporate welfare, massively growing government, inhibiting economic adaptation, and widening the gap between the rich and the poor."" DEMS FUME AS TRUMP SAYS COUNTRY MAY BE REOPENED BY EASTER The deal came hours after President Trump's top economic adviser said an unprecedented $6 trillion stimulus plan was imminent, including $4 trillion in liquidity from the Federal Reserve and $2 trillion in new money from Congress. Tensions then abruptly ratcheted back up again on Capitol Hill Tuesday night -- with Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham and Steve Daines taking to the Senate floor and calling for an end to negotiations because, as Graham put it, Democrats were ""nickel-and-diming at a time when people are dying -- literally dying."" Graham and Daines' late-night push for an immediate vote on a stimulus bill came after tensions seemingly had cooled in Congress during the day, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its highest point gain in its history as leaders from both parties signaled that an agreement could be within reach. Shares advanced in Asia on Wednesday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged to its best day since 1933 as Congress and the White House neared a deal. Japan's Nikkei 225 index jumped 5.3 percent, while Hong Kong added 3 percent and Sydney climbed 3.6 percent. Markets across Asia were all up more than 2 percent. ""Ladies and gentleman, we are done. We have a deal."" But, the Republicans said late Tuesday, Democrats were still seeking new payouts that were delaying a vote on a final bill. ""In case you're watching,"" Graham said in reference to the president, his voice rising, ""tell [Treasury Secretary] Steven Mnuchin to come back to the White House and end negotiations. I think I understand the give-and-take of life and politics, but I've been called by two good friends on the Democratic side in the last five or six hours wanting more money. End the negotiations."" He added: ""This bill is $2 trillion. There's a ton of money in this bill for people who need it, but what we're doing now is, every special-interest group in town is trying to get a little bit more."" “Listen, we were told we are at the one-yard line last night to get this done,"" Daines, who led the colloquy with Graham, said from the Senate floor. ""All I’ve got to say is, the Senate may think it’s at the one-yard line right now, but Montanans are getting sacked. In fact, our unemployment claims in Montana since march 17th, we just looked it up 15 minutes ago, 14,350 Montanans have filed for unemployment in the last week.” Monday had been marked with furious debate on the Senate floor, as Republicans accused House Democrats of proposing an alternative stimulus bill that was full of unnecessary progressive wishlist items. Senate Democrats in the meantime repeatedly blocked the Republican stimulus bill, which would require 60 votes to survive. The bill offered by Pelosi had included measures to restrict airlines' carbon emissions, protect illegal immigrants, provide for same-day voter registration, pay off billions in student loan debt, encourage federal agencies to employ ""minority banks,"" bail out the U.S. Postal Service and even fund the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. WATCH DAINES' FULL SPEECH ON THE SENATE FLOOR ""There is a whole concern in our country that if we're giving tens of billions of dollars to the airlines, that we could at least have a shared value about what happens to the environment,"" Pelosi said Tuesday. But, support for Democrats' climate-change push in the stimulus bill withered Tuesday. The former chief of staff to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Saikat Chakrabarti, wrote on Twitter in response to Pelosi's comments: ""I helped write the #GreenNewDeal and I think this is ridiculous. The tiny little emissions standard increase doesn’t even do anything meaningful to stave off climate change and gives the @GOP  leverage to get rid of real help for working people. Solve the problem at hand. Hospitals would get significant help as well."" Republicans, including the president, have called the measures irrelevant ""nonsense"" and total nonstarters. After Democrats signaled they might be willing to negotiate away some of their proposals, though, the Dow surged and lawmakers appeared optimistic. Democrats have argued the GOP package would do too much for large corporations and not enough for workers, and inaccurately suggested that the treasury secretary would have unilateral control over a massive ""slush fund."" WHAT'S IN PELOSI'S CORONAVIRUS BILL? ARTS FUNDING, CLIMATE CHANGE WISHLIST, AND MORE ""This is ridiculous,"" Graham continued Tuesday night. ""Steven Mnuchin has done a good job. I appreciate his efforts to negotiate a bill that will help America. Senator [Mitch] McConnell says we're on the two-yard line. I believe the problem is that there are 20 people playing defense, and we need to take some people off the field. What bothers me is that at that late hour, I'm still getting calls from people wanting more money.""       President Trump with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, during a briefing at the White House on Tuesday. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)       Graham and Daines' frustration was matched by many of his colleagues. Louisiana GOP Sen. John Kennedy told Fox News' Sean Hannity late Tuesday that while the coronavirus ""can kill you,"" so can ""hunger."" Shortly before Graham and Daines spoke, Trump declared at a coronovirus task force briefing that the country was nearing ""the end of our historic battle"" with ""the invisible enemy"" of coronavirus. Trump's approval numbers hit their highest point ever this week, with 60 percent of Americans approving of his coronavirus response efforts. WATCH: TRUMP SAYS CORONAVIRUS SHUTDOWN MAY BE OVER BY EASTER The president also sounded an unexpectedly magnanimous note: ""I also want to thank Congress, because whether or not we're happy that they haven't quite gotten there yet, they have been working long hours. I'm talking Republicans and Democrats, all of them, the House, the Senate. I want to thank Congress because they are really trying to get there, and I think they will."" Then, Director of the U.S. National Economic Council Larry Kudlow specifically said the new coronavirus bill working its way through congressional gridlock would total $6 trillion: $4 trillion in liquidity from the Federal Reserve and $2 trillion in new money. Typical annual appropriations from Congress in a given fiscal year are around $1.2-4 trillion, with total expenditures roughly $4.3 trillion. “This package will be the single largest Main Street assistance program in the history of the United States,” Kudlow said, adding that negotiations would continue into the evening but that a vote was imminent. Meanwhile, there was some good news inside the White House grounds. As the briefing concluded, White House press Secretary Stephanie Grisham, who has been quarantined since coming in contact with Brazilian officials almost two weeks ago and working from home, revealed she has received negative COVID-19 test results and will be back to work Wednesday. Grisham will return as the Trump administration increasingly has sought to project optimism. The president, who tweeted Sunday that ""WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF,"" declared at the Fox News virtual town hall that he ""would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter.""       Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, center, on his way to the offices of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)       Pressed by Fox News' John Roberts on the timeline, Trump said at the briefing: ""We'll be looking at a lot of things -- we'll also be looking at very large portions of our country, but I'll be guided very much by Dr. [Anthony] Fauci, and by Deborah [Birx]."" Fauci, the longtime head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, whose absence from recent coronavirus briefings triggered a wave of speculation in the media, said the timeline was still ""flexible."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Democrats have reacted furiously to Trump's new timeline for relaxing economic restrictions, with Hillary Clinton suggesting people would ""needlessly die,"" and Joe Biden accusing Trump of spreading ""misinformation.""

"                          Seen and Unseen: Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo reveals the story behind the headlines. Joe Biden has had a gaffe-filled week in his return to the spotlight after being oddly invisible the previous week amid the coronavirus pandemic, with his hastily arranged comeback blitz driving an onslaught of negative publicity. “Over the past 48 hours, he has shown up several times -- in his own live-streamed statement, on ‘The View,’ on MSNBC and CNN. It did not go well,” Fourth Watch editor Steve Krakauer wrote. “Look, I think we as a society should respect our elders. But there's just something wrong with Joe Biden.” It started Monday with widely panned remarks on the coronavirus, featuring the 2020 Democratic front-runner appearing to lose his train of thought when his teleprompter malfunctioned. BIDEN MOCKED AFTER APPARENT TELEPROMPTER ISSUE DURING CORONAVIRUS REMARKS: ‘LET ME GO TO THE SECOND THING’ The livestream began with Biden touching his face despite ongoing warnings not to do that during the coronavirus pandemic—but this would a reoccurring blunder for the former vice president. Biden then attempted to detail his plan to fight the coronavirus crisis, but appeared to lose track of his place on the teleprompter and signaled to his staff that there was something wrong, before going off on an uncomfortable ad-lib. ""And, in addition to that, in addition to that we have to make sure that we, we are in a position that we are, well met me go the second thing, I've spoken enough on that,"" Biden said. CNN'S JAKE TAPPER TEACHES BIDEN HOW TO COUGH PROPERLY IN AWKWARD INTERVIEW MOMENT Biden was back at it on Tuesday, first with an appearance on “The View,” and he touched his face so many times that social media guru Caleb Hull put together a compilation. Biden wasn’t only criticized for touching his face on “The View,” as he was also accused of giving an incoherent answer when co-host Sara Haines asked if businesses should reopen in the near future. JOE BIDEN'S CORONAVIRUS PLAN: WHAT'S IN IT? “We have to take care of the cure, that will make the problem worse, no matter what,” Biden responded, sparking confusion and criticism on social media. Conservative strategist Chris Barron compared Biden’s recent media appearances to “Monty Python” skits. “It’s truly incomprehensible how completely confused and befuddled he seems. The only chance Joe Biden has is if he is quarantined for the next six months,” Barron told Fox News. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Even far-left activist Shaun King was surprised by what he saw. “I repeatedly said that it was unthinkable that @JoeBiden was not on television,” King wrote. “I change my mind. I now understand why they didn't put him on TV.” Later in the day Biden appeared on CNN and was lectured by anchor Jake Tapper about how to properly cough during an on-air interview. Biden was discussing the latest on combating the pandemic from his home when it was interrupted by a cough. ""Excuse me,"" Biden said after he coughed into his hand. ""You know, you're supposed to cough into your elbow,"" Tapper told the former vice president as he himself demonstrated with his elbow. ""I learned that, actually, covering your White House."" ""Actually, that's true,"" Biden conceded. ""But fortunately, I'm alone in my home, but that's OK. I agree, you're right."" CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK: HOW SENIORS CAN GET HELP WITH GROCERIES, MEALS, MEDICINE The CNN anchor, however, doubled down on the proper etiquette lesson. ""It's kinda just old school to do it with your hand,"" Tapper added while demonstrating with his elbow again. ""Do it into your elbow."" The most uncomfortable moment of the week for Biden was arguably an appearance on MSNBC when he appeared to lose his train of thought, again, and even apologized for it during an interview with Nicolle Wallace. “Why doesn’t [Trump] just act like a president? That’s a stupid way to say it… I really wish he. Sorry,” Biden said as Wallace urged him to finish making his point. “Oh, ah, probably best I don’t,” Biden responded. HOW TO HELP YOUR COMMUNITY DURING THE ONGOING CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC Biden also made Wallace awkwardly smile when he compared Trump to a yo-yo before interrupting himself. “I shouldn’t have said it that way,” Biden said. By Tuesday evening, montages of Biden’s bloopers began to circulate on social media. By Wednesday morning the Internet was filled with negative headlines about the Democratic presidential hopeful. The Daily Caller accused him of “pushing misinformation” about the coronavirus and Deadline wrote, “Joe Biden Gaffe Alert: Stuns ‘The View’ By Claiming Coronavirus Cure Will Make The Problem Worse.” “Some Democrats have privately told Biden that he has to improve,” the Washington Post reported. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Los Angeles Times wrote that Biden is “struggling to find a message that gets him back on voters’ radar,” while The Federalist wrote that Biden “seems to have finally given up on sounding articulate.” The Atlantic’s Alex Wagner took things even further, writing a piece simply headlined, “Stay Alive, Joe Biden.” “Democrats need little from the front-runner beyond his corporeal presence,” Wagner’s article states directly in the subhead.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.  Sign up here. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi signaled tepid support Wednesday for the Senate’s multitrillion-dollar coronavirus response package, saying the bipartisan deal has moved from “corporations-focused to workers-first” and her colleagues will review the plan. The statement came as draft text of the sprawling, $2 trillion plan emerged, with the Senate barreling toward a likely vote sometime Wednesday after two failed attempts on the original version of the legislation earlier in the week. WHITE HOUSE, SENATE STRIKE DEAL ON CORONAVIRUS BILL Senate lawmakers and Trump administration officials negotiated late into the night to reach a deal. But even if it passes the upper chamber, support in the Democrat-controlled House is key. Pelosi had scrambled talks by pursuing a separate House bill that contained provisions Republicans decried as extraneous and political in nature. In a written statement, Pelosi indicated, however, she is open to the latest Senate version. “America is facing a grave health crisis with a serious impact on our economy. I salute the strong leadership of Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats,” she said Wednesday. “I especially thank our House Democratic Committee Chairmen, who worked hard to move the Republican proposal from corporations-focused to workers-first and who will now review the legislative text of this agreement with our Caucus.” Pelosi went on to say that the original Senate GOP legislation, which was blocked by Democrats twice in the Senate, “was a non-starter.” “This bipartisan legislation takes us a long way down the road in meeting the needs of the American people,” Pelosi said. The speaker went on to say that the new package “does not go as far” as the bill she and House Democrats proposed on Monday, but that “due to the unity and insistence of Senate and House Democrats, the bill has moved a great deal closer to America’s workers.” HOW SENATE BILL BOOSTS UNEMPLOYMENT AID It remains unclear whether Pelosi's caucus will get on board with the bill, or whether any last-minute hurdles will emerge on the Senate side, as lawmakers say they want to send relief to Americans dealing with the economic fallout from the pandemic immediately. The House has adjourned and is not expected to meet again until late Thursday morning. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on the floor Wednesday that his chamber would act on the legislation later in the day, calling it an “emergency relief” measure more than a “stimulus” package. “Nobody thinks legislation can end this. You cannot outlaw the virus,” he cautioned. “It’s the American people who will beat this virus.” Democrats had claimed the earlier Senate bill did too much for large corporations and didn’t do enough for workers. Upon reaching an agreement with Republicans and the White House, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the bill amounts to “unemployment compensation on steroids,"" and that every American who is laid off will have their missed salary remunerated. That provision will enable companies to stay afloat and immediately bring back those employees when things are safe, Schumer said. Democrats said the package specifically would help replace the salaries of furloughed workers for four months, rather than the three months first proposed. Furloughed workers would get whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment, plus a $600 per week add-on, with gig workers like Uber drivers covered for the first time. The package also would give one-time payments of $1,200 per adult and $500 per child directly to the public. The massive economic relief package would provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines, given that Democrats wanted them to abide by new carbon emissions restrictions. Republicans also won inclusion of an ""employee retention"" tax credit that's estimated to provide $50 billion to companies that retain employees on payroll and cover 50 percent of workers' paychecks. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2 percent Social Security payroll tax. Other provisions in a related package, according to a summary, include $100 billion for direct aid to health care institutions battling the crisis; more than $4 billion to health agencies; $200 million to help nursing homes cope with the challenge; $45 billion for FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund and millions more for FEMA grants; and $400 million in election assistance to help states expand early voting and vote-by-mail options. McConnell, R-Ky., has not yet set a time for a vote. “Democrats are finally taking ‘yes’ for an answer,"" McConnell said in his remarks on the Senate floor early Wednesday morning. ""Help is on the way.” “After days of intense discussions, the Senate has reached a bipartisan agreement on a historic relief package for this pandemic,” he continued. “It will rush new resources onto the front lines of our nation's health care fight. And it will inject trillions of dollars of cash into the economy as fast as possible to help Americans workers, families, small businesses and industries make it through this disruption and emerge on the other side ready to soar.” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who was smiling after McConnell left the floor, told reporters: ""This is a very important bipartisan piece of legislation that is going to be very important to help American workers, American business and people across America. So, we couldn't be more pleased. I've spoken to the president, many times today, and he's very pleased with this legislation, and the impact that this is going to have.” Meanwhile, the House may seek to pass the legislation via unanimous consent because many members are not in Washington -- but a single member can ruin that plan. The House used unanimous consent during the 1918 flu pandemic as well.

Joe Biden is taking aim again at President Trump’s response to the coronavirus outbreak. But he has seemingly tempered his comments this week compared to the language he used just a few days ago. “The American people are rising to meet this moment. We need our president to do the same,” the all-but-certain Democratic presidential nominee wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. The former vice president repeatedly called out Trump for what many critics charge is a continued downplaying of the severity of the pandemic. BIDEN STRUGGLING TO BREAK THROUGH DURING CORONAVIRUS CRISIS Compare that to how Biden – on a conference call with reporters on Friday -- urged Trump to “stop saying false things,"" saying, ""People are worried. They are really frightened. And when these things don’t come true, you just exacerbate their concern. Stop saying false things [you] think make you sound like a hero.” The former vice president also argued then that Trump had repeatedly lied to Americans, saying “for the first two months of this crisis, President Trump used his public statements to falsely tell us we had nothing to worry about….now he’s switched to falsely telling us that he’s taking action he has not taken, promising results he’s not delivered and announcing actions that he not even ordered. And people are scared.” But on Monday, a seemingly milder tone emerged from Biden. “Donald Trump is not to blame for the coronavirus. But he does bear responsibility for our response,” Biden said during the inaugural use of a new TV studio constructed in his home in Wilmington, Delaware. “This isn’t about politics. This is simply too much at stake.” On Tuesday -- after the president made controversial comments at a Fox News virtual town hall suggesting that social distancing efforts to limit the spread of the coronavirus outbreak could be lifted in the coming weeks and that Americans could be back to work and back in places of worship as early as Easter – Biden was critical but appeared to turn down the volume, saying in a CNN interview that Trump “should stop talking and start to listen to the medical experts.” THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN Asked about his jabs at the president, Biden said in an appearance on ""The View"" that “I’ve not been criticizing the president but I’ve been pointing out where there’s disagreement as to how to proceed.” Biden emphasized that “the American people don’t want us in a political fight and I want no part of a political fight either. But when a president says things that in fact turn out not to be accurate, we should not say ‘you’re lying,’ we should say ‘Mr. President that’s not the facts, here’s the deal.’ For example when he said we had all the tests were available, well they weren’t available.” A senior Biden campaign official told Fox News that “we’ve responded in real-time as the president continues to make what we think are the wrong decisions” and promised that “you’re going to continue to see him comment in real-time on social through statements, on video.” In recent days, Trump’s reelection campaign has repeatedly accused Biden of trying to politicize the crisis. ""By preying upon Americans’ fear amid the coronavirus outbreak, Biden isn’t just playing cheap politics. He’s making the crisis worse. It’s dangerous,” the Trump campaign said. ""Biden's Monday morning quarterbacking is an effort to sow anger and division among Americans."" A longtime Democratic strategist and communications consultant emphasized that the former vice president’s voice should preach unity. Lynda Tran, a veteran of the Democratic National Committee and the Obama-era grassroots group Organizing for America, told Fox News that Biden’s “message has to be about the unity it will require to survive this moment: We are better than this. We can and will get through this together. That is the point of social-distancing and shelter-in-place policies. It's literally the opposite of ‘I alone can solve this.’”    ",         Biden tempers attacks on Trump as coronavirus crisis builds,         2020-03-25T121252-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/biden-tempers-attacks-on-trump-as-coronavirus-crisis-builds,Fox
"                          The National Coalition for Men is challenging the Selective Service System in court, arguing that women should be part of the draft. A new report from a U.S. military commission concluded that women should be eligible for the draft if the country should ever need to reinstate the system that calls Americans into active-duty service. The National Commission on Military, National and Public Service determined that the U.S. would be best suited to require both men and women between the ages of 18 and 26 to register for the Selective Service, which would serve as a pool for any future draft. Currently, only men register. APPEALS COURT MULLS WHETHER ALL-MALE MILITARY DRAFT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL ""Should future circumstances become so dire that a draft is required, it is in the national security interest of the United States to be able to draw on the best talent in the country for military service,"" the commission's report said. ""Roughly doubling the pool from which the Nation might obtain conscripts would improve military readiness by raising the quality of those who might serve, as some women would be more qualified to serve than some men."" The report said the commission conducted ""extensive deliberations"" before reaching their conclusion, calling the inclusion of women ""a necessary and fair step."" Because the draft was abolished in 1973, a new law would have to be passed before any Selective Service registrants -- male or female -- would be conscripted. The report notes that a random lottery would then be held and then people would be called in an order based on birth year. Once a person is called, they would then have to go through a battery of examinations looking at physical, mental and moral fitness before they would actually join the military. This is just part of the commission's recommendations ""to modernize, enhance and improve America's system to draw on the talents, skills and abilities of all Americans if a national emergency requires lawmakers to do so."" The Supreme Court's 1981 decision in Rostker v. Goldberg held that restricting the Selective Service to men was constitutional because registration was primarily meant to prepare for drafting combat troops and at the time women were barred from combat roles. VETERANS' TIPS ON KEEPING CALM DURING CORONAVIRUS, STAYING SAFE The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals is currently considering a case that challenges the exclusion of women, after a lower court ruled that it was unconstitutional. The commission pointed to the lifting of restrictions on women in combat positions in 2015 and the varied roles played by military personnel in determining that the court's reasoning is outdated. ""Indeed, historical analysis shows that conscripts have been assigned to meet a range of military needs during conflict,"" the report said. ""For example, a comparison of the number of personnel inducted during World War II and the total assigned to combat roles reveals that less than half of all conscripts were assigned to ground combat roles in that conflict."" The commission also claimed that barring women from the Selective Service ""unacceptably excludes women from a fundamental civic obligation and reinforces gender stereotypes about the role of women, undermining national security."" The expansion of draft eligibility is only part of the commission's recommendations for increasing participation in national service. They recommend a ""revolutionary and inclusive approach to service"" comprising ""comprehensive civic education and service learning starting in kindergarten, service-year opportunities so ubiquitous that service becomes a rite of passage for millions of young adults, and new and revitalized service options for adults of any age, background, or experience. ""By 2031 — the 70th anniversary of President Kennedy's call for Americans to serve their Nation — the Commission envisions that 5 million Americans will begin participating in military, national, or public service each year,"" the report says. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Public service includes working for federal, state, tribal or local government, and national service includes non-governmental civilian effort ""that pursues and enhances the common good and meets the needs of communities, the States, or the Nation"" in areas including health, security and care for the elderly. The commission hopes that their recommendations can bring about ""a culture in which individuals of all backgrounds both expect and aspire to serve their Nation or community and have meaningful opportunities to serve throughout their lifetime.""

"                          President Trump announces he has suspended student loan payments without penalty for at least 60 days, and he's moving tax day to July 15, 2020 Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.  Sign up here. The Senate’s new coronavirus stimulus package would suspend federal student loan payments through the end of September, following President Trump’s recent order to postpone borrower payments for at least the next 60 days. Under the draft legislation, obtained by Fox News Wednesday, federal student loan payments would be suspended through Sept. 30. TRUMP ANNOUNCES CORONAVIRUS-RELATED SUSPENSION OF FEDERAL STUDENT LOANS The bill specifies that “interest shall not accrue” on the loans during this period, and that there would be no penalty for student borrowers. The language comes after proposals from House and Senate Democrats to suspend payments throughout the entirety of the national emergency over COVID-19. Democrats in both chambers had proposed reducing each borrower’s student loan balance by $10,000, a provision that was not included in the draft legislation. PELOSI WARMS TO SENATE CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS BILL The bill, at this point, has been embraced by the White House and has bipartisan support in the Senate. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., also signaled her early support for the proposed stimulus package. SENATE DEMS PROPOSE SUSPENDING STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS DURING CORONAVIRUS NATIONAL EMERGENCY Last week, Trump announced that he had suspended federal student loan payments for “at least the next 60 days,” penalty-free and interest-free. That announcement came after Trump, earlier in the week, waived interest on all federal student loans. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos announced that she also directed the Department of Education to halt collection and wage garnishments to provide additional assistance to borrowers, noting that flexibility would last, also, for at least 60 days. “These are difficult times for many Americans, and we don’t want to do anything that will make it harder for them to make ends meet or create additional stress,” DeVos said in a statement Wednesday. “Americans counting on their tax refund or Social Security check to make ends meet during this national emergency should receive those funds, and our actions today will make sure they do.” DeVos’ move also stops the Treasury from withholding money from defaulted student loan borrower’s federal income tax refunds, Social Security and other federal payments.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.  Sign up here. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi signaled tepid support Wednesday for the Senate’s multitrillion-dollar coronavirus response package, saying the bipartisan deal has moved from “corporations-focused to workers-first” and her colleagues will review the plan. The statement came as text of the sprawling, $2 trillion plan was released, with the Senate barreling toward a likely vote sometime Wednesday after two failed attempts on the original version of the legislation earlier in the week. WHITE HOUSE, SENATE STRIKE DEAL ON CORONAVIRUS BILL Senate lawmakers and Trump administration officials negotiated late into the night to reach a deal. But even if it passes the upper chamber, support in the Democrat-controlled House is key. Pelosi had scrambled talks by pursuing a separate House bill that contained provisions Republicans decried as extraneous and political in nature. In a written statement, Pelosi indicated, however, she is open to the latest Senate version. “America is facing a grave health crisis with a serious impact on our economy. I salute the strong leadership of Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats,” she said Wednesday. “I especially thank our House Democratic Committee Chairmen, who worked hard to move the Republican proposal from corporations-focused to workers-first and who will now review the legislative text of this agreement with our Caucus.” Pelosi went on to say that the original Senate GOP legislation, which was blocked by Democrats twice in the Senate, “was a non-starter.” “This bipartisan legislation takes us a long way down the road in meeting the needs of the American people,” Pelosi said. The speaker went on to say that the new package “does not go as far” as the bill she and House Democrats proposed on Monday, but that “due to the unity and insistence of Senate and House Democrats, the bill has moved a great deal closer to America’s workers.” HOW SENATE BILL BOOSTS UNEMPLOYMENT AID It remains unclear whether Pelosi's caucus will get on board with the bill, or whether any last-minute hurdles will emerge on the Senate side, as lawmakers say they want to send relief to Americans dealing with the economic fallout from the pandemic immediately. The House has adjourned and is not expected to meet again until late Thursday morning. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on the floor Wednesday that his chamber would act on the legislation later in the day, calling it an “emergency relief” measure more than a “stimulus” package. “Nobody thinks legislation can end this. You cannot outlaw the virus,” he cautioned. “It’s the American people who will beat this virus.” Democrats had claimed the earlier Senate bill did too much for large corporations and didn’t do enough for workers. Upon reaching an agreement with Republicans and the White House, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the bill amounts to “unemployment compensation on steroids,"" and that every American who is laid off will have their missed salary remunerated. That provision will enable companies to stay afloat and immediately bring back those employees when things are safe, Schumer said. Democrats said the package specifically would help replace the salaries of furloughed workers for four months, rather than the three months first proposed. Furloughed workers would get whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment, plus a $600 per week add-on, with gig workers like Uber drivers covered for the first time. The package also would give one-time payments of $1,200 per adult and $500 per child directly to the public. The massive economic relief package would provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines, given that Democrats wanted them to abide by new carbon emissions restrictions. Republicans also won inclusion of an ""employee retention"" tax credit that's estimated to provide $50 billion to companies that retain employees on payroll and cover 50 percent of workers' paychecks. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2 percent Social Security payroll tax. Other provisions in a related package, according to a summary, include $100 billion for direct aid to health care institutions battling the crisis; more than $4 billion to health agencies; $200 million to help nursing homes cope with the challenge; $45 billion for FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund; and $400 million in election assistance to help states expand early voting and vote-by-mail options. McConnell, R-Ky., has not yet set a time for a vote. “Democrats are finally taking ‘yes’ for an answer,"" McConnell said in his remarks on the Senate floor early Wednesday morning. ""Help is on the way.” “After days of intense discussions, the Senate has reached a bipartisan agreement on a historic relief package for this pandemic,” he continued. “It will rush new resources onto the front lines of our nation's health care fight. And it will inject trillions of dollars of cash into the economy as fast as possible to help Americans workers, families, small businesses and industries make it through this disruption and emerge on the other side ready to soar.” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who was smiling after McConnell left the floor, told reporters: ""This is a very important bipartisan piece of legislation that is going to be very important to help American workers, American business and people across America. So, we couldn't be more pleased. I've spoken to the president, many times today, and he's very pleased with this legislation, and the impact that this is going to have.” Meanwhile, the House may seek to pass the legislation via unanimous consent because many members are not in Washington -- but a single member can ruin that plan. The House used unanimous consent during the 1918 flu pandemic as well.

"                          The National Coalition for Men is challenging the Selective Service System in court, arguing that women should be part of the draft. A new report from a U.S. military commission concluded that women should be eligible for the draft if the country should ever need to reinstate the system that calls Americans into active-duty service. The National Commission on Military, National and Public Service determined that the U.S. would be best suited to require both men and women between the ages of 18 and 26 to register for the Selective Service, which would serve as a pool for any future draft. Currently, only men register. APPEALS COURT MULLS WHETHER ALL-MALE MILITARY DRAFT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL ""Should future circumstances become so dire that a draft is required, it is in the national security interest of the United States to be able to draw on the best talent in the country for military service,"" the commission's report said. ""Roughly doubling the pool from which the Nation might obtain conscripts would improve military readiness by raising the quality of those who might serve, as some women would be more qualified to serve than some men."" The report said the commission conducted ""extensive deliberations"" before reaching their conclusion, calling the inclusion of women ""a necessary and fair step."" Selective Service noted in a statement that in order for the commission's recommendations to be put into effect, ""the law would first have to be changed should Congress decide to adopt any of the Commission’s recommendations pertaining to Selective Service."" Additionally, because the draft was abolished in 1973, another new law would have to be passed before any Selective Service registrants -- male or female -- would be conscripted. The report notes that a random lottery would then be held and then people would be called in an order based on birth year. Once a person is called, they would then have to go through a battery of examinations looking at physical, mental and moral fitness before they would actually join the military. This is just part of the commission's recommendations ""to modernize, enhance and improve America's system to draw on the talents, skills and abilities of all Americans if a national emergency requires lawmakers to do so."" The Supreme Court's 1981 decision in Rostker v. Goldberg held that restricting the Selective Service to men was constitutional because registration was primarily meant to prepare for drafting combat troops and at the time women were barred from combat roles. VETERANS' TIPS ON KEEPING CALM DURING CORONAVIRUS, STAYING SAFE The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals is currently considering a case that challenges the exclusion of women, after a lower court ruled that it was unconstitutional. The commission pointed to the lifting of restrictions on women in combat positions in 2015 and the varied roles played by military personnel in determining that the court's reasoning is outdated. ""Indeed, historical analysis shows that conscripts have been assigned to meet a range of military needs during conflict,"" the report said. ""For example, a comparison of the number of personnel inducted during World War II and the total assigned to combat roles reveals that less than half of all conscripts were assigned to ground combat roles in that conflict."" The commission also claimed that barring women from the Selective Service ""unacceptably excludes women from a fundamental civic obligation and reinforces gender stereotypes about the role of women, undermining national security."" The expansion of draft eligibility is only part of the commission's recommendations for increasing participation in national service. They recommend a ""revolutionary and inclusive approach to service"" comprising ""comprehensive civic education and service learning starting in kindergarten, service-year opportunities so ubiquitous that service becomes a rite of passage for millions of young adults, and new and revitalized service options for adults of any age, background, or experience. ""By 2031 — the 70th anniversary of President Kennedy's call for Americans to serve their Nation — the Commission envisions that 5 million Americans will begin participating in military, national, or public service each year,"" the report says. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Public service includes working for federal, state, tribal or local government, and national service includes non-governmental civilian effort ""that pursues and enhances the common good and meets the needs of communities, the States, or the Nation"" in areas including health, security and care for the elderly. The commission hopes that their recommendations can bring about ""a culture in which individuals of all backgrounds both expect and aspire to serve their Nation or community and have meaningful opportunities to serve throughout their lifetime.""

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. Senate and White House leaders announced early Wednesday morning a deal for an unprecedented $2 trillion stimulus package to provide health care and economic aid amid the coronavirus outbreak and national shutdown of American daily life. It still has to pass the Senate and House before going to the president's desk for his signature. But here's a look at some of the highlights included in the sprawling, 500 page-plus measure. Checks and Unemployment The package provides direct financial help to Americans in the form of stimulus checks sent out to many Americans. The proposal would include a one-time payment of $1,200 per adult, $2,400 per couple in the U.S. and $500 a child. The stimulus checks would phase out for individuals making more than $75,000 and would no longer qualify for those making more than $99,000. Those thresholds double for couples. Democrats said the package specifically would help replace the salaries of furloughed workers for four months, rather than the three months first proposed. Furloughed workers would get whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment, plus a $600 per week add-on, with gig workers like Uber drivers covered for the first time. SENATE DEMS PROPOSE ADDITIONAL $200 IN MONTHLY SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS, AMID CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK Small Business Support         The massive economic relief package would provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. In addition, $562 million is also being put aside to help small businesses by ensuring SBA has the resources to provide Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) to businesses that need financial support. These loans will be available during an emergency period that ends June 30 and will be forgiven if the employer continues to pay workers for the duration of the public health and financial crisis. Funding for Public Health A large chunk of the bill focuses on public health, including $100 billion for a new program to provide direct aid to health care institutions on the front line of the coronavirus pandemic and $16 billion being allocated to replenish the Strategic National Stockpile supplies of pharmaceuticals, personal protective equipment, and other medical supplies, which are distributed to state and local health agencies, hospitals and other healthcare entities facing shortages during emergencies. Another $4.3 billion will go to federal, state, and local public health agencies to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the coronavirus, including for the purchase of personal protective equipment; laboratory testing to detect positive cases; infection control and mitigation at the local level to prevent the spread of the virus; and other public health preparedness and response activities. An additional $1 billion will be put into the Defense Production Act to bolster domestic supply chains, enabling the industry to quickly ramp up production of personal protective equipment, ventilators, and other urgently needed medical supplies, and billions dollars more for federal, state, and local health agencies to purchase such equipment.

It includes $10 billion in grants to help the country's airports as the aviation sector grapples with the steepest and potentially sustained decline in air travel in history. For airlines in particular, the bill includes $46 billion in total for the industry, with $25 billion going to passenger airlines, $4 billion for cargo companies, and $17 billion for companies deemed important to national security. Republicans also won the inclusion of an ""employee retention"" tax credit that's estimated to provide $50 billion to companies that retain employees on payroll and cover 50 percent of workers' paychecks. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2 percent Social Security payroll tax. With memories of the 2008 financial crisis still on the minds of many lawmakers, the bill will also the immediate disclosure of the recipients of any loans and stronger oversight. This includes installing an inspector general and congressionally appointed board to monitor and making sure companies can't use the loans for stock buybacks. A  final facet of the bill ensures that companies owned by President Trump's family can't receive any loans from the fund.

The Senate stimulus compromise package aimed at helping Americans cope with the economic woes caused by the coronavirus crisis includes millions for the arts. The inclusion in the Senate bill follows an outcry from conservatives over a host of provisions in the House Democrats' coronavirus proposal earlier this week, which critics said addressed liberal priorities rather than the coronavirus pandemic.

"                          Fox News has confirmed the departure of Corbin Trent from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's re-election campaign. He was the campaign’s spokesman and former leader at Justice Democrats. A Green New Deal co-author panned Speaker Nancy Pelosi for including ""tiny"" airline emissions standards in the House's coronavirus response package, arguing now is not the time for token environmental provisions when Americans' livelihoods are hanging in the balance. Saikat Chakrabarti, the former chief of staff to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, called Pelosi's idea ""ridiculous"" to include carbon emission language in legislation designed to keep Americans from losing their incomes, homes and businesses during the pandemic. ""I helped write the #GreenNewDeal and I think this is ridiculous,"" tweeted Chakrabarti, who helped author the Green New Deal while working with Ocasio-Cortez and Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey's office. ""The tiny little emissions standard increase doesn’t even do anything meaningful to stave off climate change and gives the @GOP leverage to get rid of real help for working people. Solve the problem at hand."" Chakrabarti was reacting to a TV interview where Pelosi defended the airline carbon emission language in the House bill. TRUMP ON HOUSE DEMS' CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL: 'NO WAY I’M SIGNING THAT DEAL' WITH 'GREEN NEW DEAL STUFF ""There is a whole concern in our country that if we're giving tens of billions of dollars to the airlines, that we could at least have a shared value about what happens to the environment,"" Pelosi said. The House stimulus bill, which hasn't passed, includes aid to the flagging airline industry but requires the airlines to fully offset their carbon emissions starting in 2025. The House Democrats'  legislation also calls for airlines to reduce their carbon emissions by 25 percent by 2035 and 50 percent by 2050. Republicans panned the House bill as being bogged down with unrelated goodies, including climate change provisions. President Trump and Republicans ripped the legislation as an effort to try to pass the ""Green New Deal,""  while Americans are struggling to keep their homes, businesses and health. However, the Green New Deal isn't in the House legislation. The Green New Deal aims to move away from old environmental regulations, such as airline emission and carbon cap and trade deals. The blueprint of the Green New Deal is a manufacturing initiative to build up a massive new clean energy infrastructure by ramping up production of solar panels, wind farms, batteries, new power grids, electric cars, charging stations and more. Green New Deal activists took issue with the coronavirus stimulus bill being stymied by minor environmental provisions they deem as laughable. Chakrabarti encouraged lawmakers to pass simple legislation immediately  -- without environmental mandates -- that ensures Americans have money coming in. ""Imagine if Pelosi had passed a simple, 5-page bill that just did the obvious stuff everyone knows [could] hold the economy together,"" the AOC ally tweeted. ""Payroll covered, debts pause[d], direct cash to people, 0% interest loans for business. Then dare the Senate to oppose it. We’d have a bill last week."" WHITE HOUSE, SENATE STRIKE DEAL ON HISTORIC $2T CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL; PELOSI OFFERS TEPID ENDORSEMENT During a conference call with House Democrats Tuesday afternoon, at least one Blue Dog Democrat said Pelosi's House bill ""set people off"" and angered struggling constituents in moderate districts who think Democrats were trying to seek partisan wins like the ""Green New Deal,"" according to a person familiar with the call. Pelosi quashed the claim and said the Green New Deal isn't part of the House bill, just the airline emissions standards. Her message to the Democrats was: I do not support the Green New Deal. There is no Green New Deal in our bill, the source said. The airline emission hubbub is likely moot at this point. The Senate reached a bipartisan deal for its $2 trillion stimulus bill that is not expected to have airline emission regulations. If the legislation passes the Senate, it will head to the House and to Trump. It would be the largest stimulus package passed in U.S. history, yet lawmakers already acknowledged at least one other round of aid is likely needed to help American families reeling from the shutdown of the economy because of the coronavirus.

White House and Senate leaders reached a historic deal shortly after midnight Wednesday on a massive $2 trillion coronavirus relief package for workers and businesses, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi offered something of a tepid endorsement of the agreement after previously pushing for her own legislation. The bipartisan breakthrough in the Senate capped days of heated negotiations that had nearly been derailed by last-minute demands from House Democrats. “Ladies and gentleman, we are done,"" White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland announced as he left the office of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., near midnight. ""We have a deal."" Ueland told reporters that ""much of the work on bill text has been completed, and I’m hopeful over the next few hours we’ll finish what's left and we will circulate it early in the morning.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the bill amounts to “unemployment compensation on steroids,"" and that Americans who have been laid off will have their missed salary remunerated.

The package also would give one-time payments of $1,200 per adult and $500 per child directly to the public. Although 2019 tax returns would be used to determine income (or 2018 tax returns if those are the most recent available), experts said it was likely the bill would contain provisions for those who do not file returns. A draft version of the bill, released Wednesday afternoon, states: ""If the individual has not filed a tax return ... use information with respect to such individual for calendar year 2019 provided in—‘(i) Form SSA-1099, Social Security Benefit Statement, or ‘(ii) Form RRB-1099, Social Security equivalent Benefit Statement.""

The breakthrough came as support for Pelosi's climate-change push in the stimulus bill withered Tuesday. The former chief of staff to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Saikat Chakrabarti, wrote on Twitter: ""I helped write the #GreenNewDeal and I think this is ridiculous. The tiny little emissions standard increase doesn’t even do anything meaningful to stave off climate change and gives the @GOP  leverage to get rid of real help for working people. Solve the problem at hand. Hospitals would get significant help as well."" In a letter to his colleagues, Schumer remarked, “Democrats are ready to give our unanimous consent to speed up the consideration of the bill and get the job done.“ That means that if there are no objections from Republicans, the Senate could clear the bill without a formal roll call vote. Parliamentarily, that is the fastest way to move something on the floor. A senior GOP source told Fox News contributor and Townhall.com editor Guy Benson that the move was a face-saving exercise by Schumer, and that he was trying to ""take credit"" for a GOP bill that he filibustered for ""small ball"" alterations. Democrats, the source said, couldn't drag the situation out much longer; economic conditions have worsened dramatically, and President Trump's approval rating has risen. A senior Republican aide separately told Fox News: ""Reading Chuck Schumer's list, I half expected that the next thing I read would be the Minority Leader taking credit for inventing fire. The reality is that almost every significant 'win' he's taking credit for, is actually a Senate Republican idea."" Republicans had ""never objected"" to more hospital funding, or that oversight of the stimulus stabilization fund ""be structured almost exactly like TARP oversight,"" the aide went on. And Republicans were the first to push for three months of unemployment insurance and ""did not oppose adding a fourth."" ""Virtually all of the main policy features that Senator Schumer describes as 'unemployment insurance on steroids' were ideas that took shape during the bipartisan weekend working group phase and which were included in the Sunday bill that Democrats blocked twice,"" the aide said. ""The only truly material change on unemployment during the Democrats‘ obstruction was the change from three months to four, something that could’ve easily been plussed up during the 30 hours of post-cloture time."" ""To sum up, Senator Schumer delayed life-saving aid to medical professionals and significant relief for families and small businesses in order to claim credit for wins that are either bipartisan or Republican ideas,"" the aide concluded. ""Stay tuned for all the unrelated wish list items Congressional Democrats demanded and Republicans stopped."" McConnell said the Senate will meet at noon on Wednesday, but did not set a time for a vote. By rule, the procedural vote to begin debate on the coronavirus package would happen at 1 p.m. ET, unless the Senate scraps that vote‬. “Democrats are finally taking ‘yes’ for an answer,"" McConnell said in his remarks on the Senate floor early Wednesday morning. ""Help is on the way.” “After days of intense discussions, the Senate has reached a bipartisan agreement on a historic relief package for this pandemic,” he continued. “It will rush new resources onto the front lines of our nation's health care fight.

Later, Pelosi told reporters, ""We’re reviewing it now. We have a staff and our chairman reviewing the bill. We're optimistic but we’ll see."" Regardless, the House will not pass coronavirus bill on Wednesday. The chamber was quickly gaveled in and gaveled out. Senior sources tell Fox News House won’t meet again later today, and will convene Thursday at 11 a.m. ET. Meanwhile, Michigan independent Rep. Justin Amash, who recently left the Republican Party, signaled that he might essentially delay consideration of the bill in the House. The lower chamber may seek to pass the legislation via unanimous consent because many members are not in Washington -- but a single member can ruin that plan. The House used unanimous consent during the 1918 flu pandemic as well. DEMS FUME AS TRUMP SAYS COUNTRY MAY BE REOPENED BY EASTER ""We're optimistic, but we’ll see."" ""This bipartisan deal is a raw deal for the people,"" Amash tweeted. ""It does far too little for those who need the most help, while providing hundreds of billions in corporate welfare, massively growing government, inhibiting economic adaptation, and widening the gap between the rich and the poor."" The deal came hours after President Trump's top economic adviser said an unprecedented $6 trillion stimulus plan was imminent, including $4 trillion in liquidity from the Federal Reserve and $2 trillion in new money from Congress. Tensions then abruptly ratcheted back up again on Capitol Hill Tuesday night -- with Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham and Steve Daines taking to the Senate floor and calling for an end to negotiations because, as Graham put it, Democrats were ""nickel-and-diming at a time when people are dying -- literally dying."" Graham and Daines' late-night push for an immediate vote on a stimulus bill came after tensions seemingly had cooled in Congress during the day, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its highest point gain in its history as leaders from both parties signaled that an agreement could be within reach. Shares advanced in Asia on Wednesday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged to its best day since 1933 as Congress and the White House neared a deal. Japan's Nikkei 225 index jumped 5.3 percent, while Hong Kong added 3 percent and Sydney climbed 3.6 percent. Markets across Asia were all up more than 2 percent. But, the Republicans said late Tuesday, Democrats were still seeking new payouts that were delaying a vote on a final bill. ""In case you're watching,"" Graham said in reference to the president, his voice rising, ""tell [Treasury Secretary] Steven Mnuchin to come back to the White House and end negotiations. I think I understand the give-and-take of life and politics, but I've been called by two good friends on the Democratic side in the last five or six hours wanting more money. End the negotiations."" He added: ""This bill is $2 trillion. There's a ton of money in this bill for people who need it, but what we're doing now is, every special-interest group in town is trying to get a little bit more."" “Listen, we were told we are at the one-yard line last night to get this done,"" Daines, who led the colloquy with Graham, said from the Senate floor. ""All I’ve got to say is, the Senate may think it’s at the one-yard line right now, but Montanans are getting sacked. In fact, our unemployment claims in Montana since march 17th, we just looked it up 15 minutes ago, 14,350 Montanans have filed for unemployment in the last week.” Shortly before Graham and Daines spoke, Trump declared at a coronovirus task force briefing that the country was nearing ""the end of our historic battle"" with ""the invisible enemy"" of coronavirus. Trump's approval numbers hit their highest point ever this week, with 60 percent of Americans approving of his coronavirus response efforts. WATCH: TRUMP SAYS CORONAVIRUS SHUTDOWN MAY BE OVER BY EASTER The president also sounded an unexpectedly magnanimous note: ""I also want to thank Congress, because whether or not we're happy that they haven't quite gotten there yet, they have been working long hours. I'm talking Republicans and Democrats, all of them, the House, the Senate. I want to thank Congress because they are really trying to get there, and I think they will."" Then, Director of the U.S. National Economic Council Larry Kudlow specifically said the new coronavirus bill working its way through congressional gridlock would total $6 trillion: $4 trillion in liquidity from the Federal Reserve and $2 trillion in new money. Typical annual appropriations from Congress in a given fiscal year are around $1.2-4 trillion, with total expenditures roughly $4.3 trillion. “This package will be the single largest Main Street assistance program in the history of the United States,” Kudlow said, adding that negotiations would continue into the evening but that a vote was imminent. Meanwhile, there was some good news inside the White House grounds. As the briefing concluded, White House press Secretary Stephanie Grisham, who has been quarantined since coming in contact with Brazilian officials almost two weeks ago and working from home, revealed she has received negative COVID-19 test results and will be back to work Wednesday. Grisham will return as the Trump administration increasingly has sought to project optimism. The president, who tweeted Sunday that ""WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF,"" declared at the Fox News virtual town hall that he ""would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter.""       Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, center, on his way to the offices of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)       Pressed by Fox News' John Roberts on the timeline, Trump said at the briefing: ""We'll be looking at a lot of things -- we'll also be looking at very large portions of our country, but I'll be guided very much by Dr. [Anthony] Fauci, and by Deborah [Birx]."" Fauci, the longtime head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, whose absence from recent coronavirus briefings triggered a wave of speculation in the media, said the timeline was still ""flexible."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Democrats have reacted furiously to Trump's new timeline for relaxing economic restrictions, with Hillary Clinton suggesting people would ""needlessly die,"" and Joe Biden accusing Trump of spreading ""misinformation."" ""This a--hole and his rich friends are too stupid to get that we can only get through this together,"" former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau wrote. ""Everyone is at risk from the virus. Everyone suffers when there aren’t enough hospital beds. Everyone struggles when millions are too sick to work."" Fellow Obama communications alum Tommy Vietor, meanwhile, deleted a tweet lamenting that he was reduced to drinking red wine in the shower during the economic shutdown.

Four Republican senators are warning that they will oppose fast-tracking the $2 trillion coronavirus response package unless a “massive drafting error” in the legislation, which they say would create an incentive for employers to lay off employees, is fixed. ""You want to destroy what's left of the economy? Pass it the way it’s written,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in a press conference. ""If you want to help people, pay them their wages, but don’t pay them more not to work."" PELOSI INDICATES SUPPORT FOR SENATE'S NEW CORONAVIRUS BILL, AS DETAILS EMERGE The concern from Sens. Graham, Tim Scott, R-S.C., Ben Sasse, R-Neb., and Rick Scott, R-Fla., is that the current version could pay workers more in unemployment benefits than they're currently making, by sticking a $600 per week payment on top of ordinary benefits that are calculated as a percentage of income. This could disrupt the labor market further, the lawmakers warn. ""A massive drafting error in the current version of the coronavirus relief legislation could have devastating consequences: Unless this bill is fixed, there is a strong incentive for employees to be laid off instead of going to work. This isn’t an abstract, philosophical point -- it’s an immediate, real-world problem,” Tim Scott, Sasse and Graham said in a statement. The White House and Senate leaders had come to an agreement on the $2 trillion package that is designed to boost the economy and provide aid to workers and businesses affected by the closing down of much of daily life in response to the coronavirus crisis. Leaders have emphasized the urgency of getting the package passed as quickly as possible in order to get assistance to Americans in need. HOW SENATE'S CORONAVIRUS BILL BOOSTS UNEMPLOYMENT AID But with the legislation nearing approval by the chamber, the Republican critics are warning that the text as written could incentivize layoffs, which they say could in turn lead to “life-threatening shortages” in health care and the food supply chain. In the press conference, Sen. Tim Scott gave the example of someone in South Carolina making $20 an hour, or $800 a week, who could get up to $326 of unemployment benefits in the state, followed by another $600 a week in the federal benefit, meaning they would be earning more than their normal salary. ""This legislation would not stop at 100 percent of your income, this legislation would allow you in unemployment to make more than you do in employment,"" Scott said. ""We know that that is a drafting error and we are simply providing an amendment to fix that so you do not make more in unemployment than you do when you're working."" ""Under this proposal ... under unemployment you’d be making $24.07 an hour in South Carolina,"" Graham said. ""There are a lot of jobs that in South Carolina don't pay $24.07 an hour."" MILLIONS FOR KENNEDY CENTER, ARTS INCLUDED IN SENATE CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS PACKAGE Graham also opened the door to the possibility that this was not a drafting error but said he was ""concerned"" that it was the explicit intention of Democrats. ""If this is not a drafting error then it's the worst idea I've seen in a long time and that's saying a lot given the fact that we’re in Washington,"" he said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The lawmakers instead are working on an amendment to fix the problem by making the unemployment benefit 100 percent of someone's salary. Graham said they would soon know whether or not it was a drafting error by whether or not their amendment is opposed by Democrats in the chamber. The lawmakers had indicated that they would oppose the fast-tracking of the bill if the error was not fixed. ""We must sadly oppose the fast-tracking of this bill until this text is addressed, or the Department of Labor issues regulatory guidance that no American would earn more by not working than by working,"" they said in the statement before the press conference.

"                          Reaction from liberal analyst Cathy Areu and Republican strategist Ash Wright. Joe Biden says he’s “had enough” of the Democratic presidential primary debates and that it’s time to “get on with this.” The former vice president and all-but-certain Democratic nominee – asked on a conference call Wednesday with reporters if there should be another primary debate in April – said, “My focus is just dealing with this crisis right now. I haven’t thought about any more debates. I think we’ve had enough debates. I think we should get on with this.” Biden’s comments came one day after the campaign of the only other remaining Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, told The New York Times that if there’s a Democratic presidential primary debate in April, their candidate expects to participate.  UNIONS GO ALL IN FOR BIDEN AS SANDERS DEFIES PRESSURE TO DROP OUT “If there is a debate in April, he plans to be there,” the Sanders campaign confirmed to Fox News.  Biden swept Sanders last week in major primaries in Florida, Illinois and Arizona. Those overwhelming victories cemented Biden’s status as the party’s likely nominee and all but destroyed Sanders’ slight chances of any comeback to win the nomination. Biden is now trying to unite the party and transition to mounting a general election challenge against President Trump. But Sanders doesn’t seem in any rush to suspend his campaign. The senator’s campaign said last week that Sanders is “reassessing” his presidential bid. Sanders has stopped criticizing Biden and is no longer fundraising for his White House bid. But he’s remained very active – holding virtual campaign events to discuss the coronavirus pandemic and raise funds to benefit the response to the outbreak. And earlier this week, the campaign spotlighted how it's ramping up organizing efforts in New York ahead of that state’s primary – which for now is still scheduled to take place on April 28. Biden stressed on Tuesday that he’s not going to personally tell the progressive senator from Vermont who’s making his second straight White House bid to call it quits. “It’s not for me to tell him to drop out.,” Biden said in an interview on ""The View."" “It’s up to Bernie to do what he wants to do.” THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN  Last year, the Democratic National Committee announced that 12 primary debates would be held. Eleven rounds have taken place to date, with the final potential debate tentatively scheduled for April. But with the nomination race all but over – and with most of the upcoming primaries being postponed as many Americans shelter in place in order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus pandemic – the likelihood of a final debate seems remote at best. The DNC has yet to weigh in on whether the debate will take place.

"                          Senate Republicans and Democrats, along with the White House, have come to an agreement on a bill to aid Americans dealing with the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Here's how the new stimulus package can expand unemployment aid if enacted by President Trump. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.  Sign up here. Rep. Seth Moulton, who briefly sought the 2020 Democratic nomination for president, revealed Wednesday he is under self-quarantine after experiencing symptoms of the novel coronavirus, but said he does not “qualify” for a test. “On Thursday, I began feeling unwell with a low grade fever and a concerning tightness in my chest, to a degree I’ve never felt before, that lasted several days,” Moulton, D-Mass., said in a statement. “I have also had a sore throat, though no serious cough, long with body aches and unusual fatigue. My wife Liz has had similar symptoms.” PELOSI INDICATES SUPPORT FOR SENATE CORONAVIRUS BILL  Moulton said that prior to experiencing symptoms consistent with coronavirus, he had “proactively instructed” his staff in both Salem, Mass. and Washington D.C. to “work entirely from home and self-isolate in order to mitigate the risk of spreading COVID-19.” Moulton said he has received medical advice from the VA, his primary health care provider, and the attending physician for Congress, Dr. Brian Monahan. “As the House doctor explained, I am ‘symptomatic,’ but because the symptoms are minor and a test would not change my treatment protocol, my wife and I don’t qualify for tests,” Moulton explained. “As a result, and out of an abundance of caution, I will follow my doctors’ direction and continue to stay home and self-quarantine until I hit seven days after my symptoms started to improve and I do not have a fever for 72 hours,” he said. Moulton added that his daughter, Emmy, who is 18-months old, “has no symptoms at all.” Moulton said he was making his symptoms and decision to self-quarantine public because he “will potentially miss some important votes as a result.” “Leadership must be personal as well, and I hope others who have mild symptoms will also self-quarantine and follow doctors’ orders,” he said. “People with symptoms should be tested, and the fact that tests are not available for Liz and me and far too many other Americans, a month after I wrote to the Vice President demanding more widespread testing, is a major failure of the Administration that I will continue fighting to fix."" He added: “We will get through this pandemic by working together from home, and we’ll be a stronger country on the other side.” Moulton is one of several House lawmakers in self-quarantine. Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., and Ben McAdams, D-Utah, tested positive for COVID-19. Meanwhile, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., tested positive for coronavirus over the weekend, sending several GOP Senators into self-quarantine. Paul is the only known senator to have coronavirus at this time. As of Wednesday afternoon, there were more than 60,000 cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. More than 825 people have died. Moulton announced his bid for president in April 2019 but suspended his bid for the White House in August.    ",         Rep.

Sign up here.**On the roster: The end of the end of recessions - Bailout deal poised for final passage - Big labor moves to push Bernie out - ‘We kind of overshot the hole on that one’THE END OF THE END OF RECESSIONSOne of the great punch lines of 20th century history is the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the 1929 treaty signed by every major world power outlawing war… 10 years before the start of the farthest-reaching, deadliest war in human history.A perfectly apt foreign policy capstone for the Hoover administration – highly idealistic, very modern and utterly misguided – it was the result of tireless work of Secretary of State Frank Kellogg, a progressive Republican former senator from Minnesota who made his fame busting up big businesses in Teddy Roosevelt’s Justice Department.Not only did the Nazis and the imperial Japanese care little about the legal power of the two-paragraph document when it came time for war, the pact itself may have even made thwarting such noxious ambitions harder. When war is outlawed, only outlaws will make war.We were thinking very much about dear, sweet Secretary Kellogg and his pact in the past six months or so as we heard increasingly adamant assurances that recessions were things of the past. We were told that thanks to the bipartisan decision to disregard any apparent limits on spending and the aggressive interventions of central banks, the normal vagaries of the business cycle and the threat of periodic recessions had been all but outlawed.Even in the longest period of economic expansion in American history, leaders in Washington and in finance were more than bullish. They were even using extraordinary measures to boost the already growing economy. When the bears have been banished, why not give the bulls their head? But nobody told the coronavirus.The tiniest, crudest of organisms have overwhelmed the capacities of the planners of every party and nation. Banks can intervene and governments can borrow, but there is no sane man or woman in the halls (or Zoom meetings) of power in Washington and New York who doesn’t know acknowledge that we are in for a serious economic beating. We don’t know how bad or for how long, but it is upon us.It has for years not been much in anyone’s political interest to complain about the constant stimulus borrowing or the Federal Reserve’s sugar highs. President Trump and his Democratic sparring partners couldn’t agree on how to wind a watch, but they certainly agreed that sloshing trillions more of funny money into the already growing economy was a good thing.But that meant that when the recession did come, the means we had been employing to keep juicing growth were insufficient for an actual rescue effort. Like antibiotic resistance, careless use on minor matters demands more and more extraordinary measures on larger threats.We can measure the consequences of these escalations not just in dollars, but also in diminished confidence in the institutions and individuals working so feverishly now to salvage as much of the supposedly unsinkable economy as they can.There are a lot of reasons that America has been wracked by spasms of angry populism for the past two decades. How we communicate, work, live and learn have all gone through massive changes in our young century, so it’s natural that our political lives would be disrupted too.But if you wanted to hold up a couple of lightning rods – real static collectors of this new populism – you might pick the Troubled Asset Relief Program of 2008 and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The bank bailout and President Barack Obama’s stimulus, both intended to address the financial panic spurred by the collapse in the housing market, became instant odiums.The government had been using extraordinary measures to keep the economy going for years after the dot-com bust and 9/11. And when the real estate bubble that our leaders themselves had helped to inflate went kablooey, they had to pump and pump and pump like they had never pumped before.The Occupy Wall Street movement and the Tea Party were coming from very different places, but they both agreed that the federal government was recklessly rewarding insiders and elites while ignoring the concerns of ordinary Americans. The government was putting the burden on all by borrowing money and levying taxes, but the benefits were only for some.We don’t know yet what components of the coronavirus stimuli will most infuriate voters in the elections to come. Bailouts for cruise ships? Another $20 billion in agriculture subsidies? Who knows?But the people in power now – many of whom rode into office partly on the strength of the anger over past bailouts – face the same kinds of pitchforks they once wielded. They will say the same things their former victims did, “But it was a crisis!” And fickle public opinion, desperate now for maximum intervention, will shift as the threat abates. Voters will tend to forget how scared they were and go back to being angry about the members of a government who failed to sufficiently protect them and then responded by dumping money on their friends in high places.BAILOUT DEAL POISED FOR FINAL PASSAGENYT: “The Senate on Wednesday moved toward a vote on a sweeping, roughly $2 trillion measure to respond to the coronavirus pandemic, after Democrats and Republicans reached a deal with the Trump administration on direct payments and jobless benefits for individuals, money for states and a huge bailout fund for businesses. The legislation, which is expected to be enacted within days, is the biggest fiscal stimulus package in modern American history, aimed at delivering support to companies forced to shut their doors, relief to Americans suffering layoffs and financial ruin, and critical aid to hospitals on the front lines of the rapidly spreading disease. The compromise was a package whose sheer size and scope would have been unthinkable only a couple of weeks ago. It touched virtually every aspect of American life, and amounted to hundreds of billions of dollars more than Congress provides for the entire United States federal budget for a single year, outside of social safety net programs.”What’s in the plan - Fox News: “The package provides direct financial help to Americans in the form of stimulus checks sent out to many Americans. The proposal would include a one-time payment of $1,200 per adult, $2,400 per couple in the U.S. and $500 a child. … The massive economic relief package would provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. … A large chunk of the bill focuses on public health, including $100 billion for a new program to provide direct aid to health care institutions on the front line of the coronavirus pandemic and $16 billion being allocated to replenish the Strategic National Stockpile supplies of pharmaceuticals, personal protective equipment, and other medical supplies… One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines…”What’s next - WaPo: “House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) gave an upbeat assessment of the bill early Wednesday, but the logistics of the legislation’s passage through the House remained unclear. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said House members needed to see final Senate text and would have 24 hours notice before any vote, ensuring that it could not happen before Thursday. … Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) raised major concerns of their own on Wednesday. They said a ‘drafting error’ in the bill would create incentives for companies to lay off workers instead of retain them on the payroll, citing a problem with the way unemployment benefits were changed.”THE RULEBOOK: $“Nothing which tends to facilitate the intercourse between the States can be deemed unworthy of the public care.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 42TIME OUT: THE SAGE OF MILLEDGEVILLEThe Writer’s Almanac: “It’s the birthday of the writer who said, ‘You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you odd,’ and ‘Where you come from is gone, where you thought you were going to never was there, and where you are is no good unless you can get away from it.’ She didn’t want a biography written about her because, she said, ‘Lives spent between the house and the chicken yard do not make exciting copy.’ That’s Flannery O’Connor, born in Savannah, Georgia (1925).

Then the United Food and Commercial Workers. The American Federation of Teachers came next, and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees followed. Joe Biden has racked up endorsements from four of the largest — and most politically influential — unions in the past 10 days, a show of force that has bolstered his standing as the de facto Democratic nominee for president and dealt a serious blow to Bernie Sanders’ flickering hopes. ‘Bernie has a real decision to make,’ AFT President Randi Weingarten said without explicitly calling on Sanders to drop out. … The coalescing of major labor support — including three of the four large public employee unions — behind Biden came as the latest blow to Sanders, a union ally whose progressive campaign is built around helping working people. Absent an unforeseen turn of events, Sanders has little realistic hope of overcoming Biden’s sizable lead in the race for enough delegates to clinch the nomination.”But he’s warming up for the next debate - NYT: “Senator Bernie Sanders plans to participate in the Democratic presidential debate in April if one is held, his campaign said on Tuesday, the strongest indication yet that he plans to continue competing against Joseph R. Biden Jr. in the 2020 primary for the foreseeable future. The Democratic National Committee has said previously that there would be a debate in April, but one has not been scheduled. The committee has not announced a media partner or a site host — critical elements that are typically agreed upon at least a month in advance. The coronavirus crisis has already upended most facets of the Democratic primary, and there is no guarantee that the debate will take place. Still, the fact that the Sanders campaign is signaling, for now, that he would be on a debate stage in April is a strikingly public sign of the Vermont senator’s determination to wield political influence and challenge Mr. Biden for primacy despite the former vice president’s nearly insurmountable delegate lead.”Biden struggles with tone, purpose in media tour - AP: “[From] a newly constructed television studio in his Wilmington, Del., home, Biden sat for a series of high-profile interviews on Tuesday. The appearances were a preview of a more public role he’s hoping to assume in the coming weeks as he emerges as the Democratic counter to Trump. In an interview with CNN, Biden took an increasingly aggressive stance against the president’s coronavirus response, urging him to ‘stop talking and start listening to the medical experts.’ He sounded similar themes in an afternoon interview on MSNBC, and during an earlier appearance on ABC’s ‘The View,’ where Biden said he’s trying to balance his critiques of Trump against anything that would seem to undermine the president during a crisis. ‘I’ve not been criticizing the president, but I’ve been pointing out where there’s disagreements on how to proceed,’ Biden said. ‘When the president says things that aren’t accurate, we should not say, ‘You’re lying.’ We should say, ‘Those aren’t the facts.’”RNC says full steam ahead for Charlotte convention - National Review: “North Carolina GOP Chairman Michael Whatley said that the Republican National Committee ‘is firmly committed to moving forward’ with its presidential convention, set to be held in Charlotte in late August, despite coronavirus concerns. ‘At this time, the RNC is firmly committed to moving forward with the RNC Convention which is scheduled to be held August 24th-27th in Charlotte,’ an open letter to North Carolina Republicans reads. ‘However, the RNC is closely monitoring conditions regarding the COVID-19 outbreak and is working closely with federal, state, and local governments in order to determine whether they will need to make any changes to the schedule.’ Democrats also have insisted that their convention, set to be held in Milwaukee in mid-July, is still on, despite reports that they were already planning for a backup, with sources telling Politico that planned walk-throughs of the convention site were delayed and convention organizing staffers are currently working from home.”PLAY BY PLAYMontana Republicans bankrolled Green Party - KTVHGeorgia moving toward a mail-in primary for May - AJCNevada switches to mail-only primary - The Nevada IndependentPoll: Trump gets a boost in approval - GallupPro-life groups push administration to stop Planned Parenthood abortions during health crisis - National ReviewAUDIBLE: LOVE YOUR BODY“Democrats need little from the front-runner beyond his corporeal presence.” -- Subhead on an Atlantic piece by former MSNBC anchor Alex Wagner declaring presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden personally irrelevant but conceptually useful.FROM THE BLEACHERS“[Tuesday’s Time Out headline] What’s a nine-letter word for puzzle?

One of the company’s founders, dentist Remington Townsend, traced the source of the masks the company was buying back to a factory in China and ordered a shipping container full of supplies, not fully realizing how large a shipping container is. ‘We kind of overshot the hole on that one,’ Townsend joked. Good thing they did. With the spread of the coronavirus, masks are suddenly in short supply and the dental group was sitting on more than 700,000 masks in storage. They spread the word about their good fortune and soon were supplying surrounding hospitals with much-needed masks at cost. … One hospital couldn’t wait for the shipment and sent an employee to Billings to load the several cartons of masks into a horse trailer.”AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES…“Don’t misunderstand. It is not that football is decadent. To say that in the age of Twisted Sister and low-cal dog food would be unfair. The problem with football is that it is imperial.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on Jan. 25, 1985.Chris Stirewalt is the politics editor for Fox News. Brianna McClelland contributed to this report.

The Senate stimulus compromise package aimed at helping Americans cope with the economic woes caused by the coronavirus crisis includes millions for the arts. The inclusion in the Senate bill follows an outcry from conservatives over a host of provisions in the House Democrats' coronavirus proposal earlier this week, which critics said addressed liberal priorities rather than the coronavirus pandemic. The appropriations text, released Wednesday along with the draft bill itself, includes $25 million in funding for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington D.C. That is down from the $35 million that was included in the recent Democratic-proposed House legislation. The Senate bill also provides $75 million to each the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. That is down from the $300 million for each that was in the House stimulus bill.

"                          Texas' Desert Door distillery has turned to making hand sanitizer to donate to first responders and health care workers during the COVID-19 crisis. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. Craft beer and spirit-makers in some of the communities most severely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic are doing more than just producing hand sanitizer for their patrons.  But even as they convert their operations almost entirely to charity, and at a time when sales are so bad they could lose everything, they are discovering new snags in the supply chain that are making it even harder to help in the current crisis.  “We sell beer from Massachusetts down to Florida with a few holes in between,” said Scott Vaccaro, founder of Captain Lawrence Brewing Co., which has been around since 2005. As a result of the current crisis, he said, “we've seen wholesale orders either completely cut to zero, by the third, half, down to a fraction.”  CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE On Tuesday, Vaccaro was cooking his first 300-gallon batch of chicken soup (40 whole chickens at a time) in what is typically his experimental-brew house. Now, that equipment is being used to support a local charity that aims to donate one million gallons of soup to local food industry workers now out of a job.  “If [people] want their favorite restaurant, or bar, or brewery to be around when this subsides, they should do their best to support them during this horrible time. Everyone is hurting and everyone could use the extra love.” “It’s the food service, it’s the restaurateurs that sell it for us, so we’ve got to take care of our people too,” he said, even though his own business “went from thriving to surviving pretty quick.” He hopes to crank out as much as 600 gallons of soup per day.  “To keep the lights on,” Vaccaro said Captain Lawrence is continuing curb-side, no-contact pickup of their beverages, family-style meals and make-your-own pizza kits.       Rob, an employee of Captain Lawrence Brewing Co. in Elmsford, New York, makes a curbside no-contact drink delivery while wearing rubber gloves as part of the brewery's coronavirus precautions, and efforts to stay afloat during the statewide shutdown.Capt. Lawrence is using brewing equipment to make hundreds of gallons of chicken soup for a local food industry worker charity.        Vaccaro also makes his own spirits, and like many other craft producers in that industry, he is now pursuing hand sanitizer production after industry regulations were changed to allow them to do so in the wake of the coronavirus. But he’s facing a new problem even in that effort, and one that may not have a quick fix in sight.  SANITIZER ""EVERYWHERE,"" NOT A BOTTLE TO BE FILLED “I have been on the phone and on the Internet for the past two days feverishly trying to acquire plastic containers to put it in,” Vaccaro said, “and let me tell you it is an absolute nightmare.” He managed to find some 3,000 10-ounce containers and a “bunch” of 64-ounce jugs, “but getting anything in the four- to eight-ounce range,” he said, “at this point seems like an almost impossibility.”  At Silk City Distillers in Clifton, N.J., the 4,000 four-ounce containers the company produced and distributed were scooped up in less than a week. The response was so high, the company had to post repeated warnings on its social media to remind people “FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, PRACTICE SOCIAL DISTANCING.”  But there was one thing that chief distiller James Bednar did not expect.  “The outreach from first responders and healthcare providers has been absolutely mind-boggling,” Bednar said. “I don’t think you could comprehend the amount of outreach, hundreds of e-mails from local fire departments to home healthcare aides to hospitals – and big hospitals,” he added.  Bednar says his company is having the same issues finding more bottles after blowing through the first 4,000. Thankfully, after hearing about what Silk City had been doing with the first 4,000 bottles, his distributor refunded the payment and promised to send another batch for free.  For their next batch, Bednar says they will likely be “shifting focus a bit and kind of focusing on the first responder side,” in the hopes of providing what they can to those on the front lines.  However, for anyone in the service industry, Vaccaro says the front lines are now everywhere. “If [people] want their favorite restaurant, or bar, or brewery to be around when this subsides, they should do their best to support them during this horrible time.

Doctors and nurses are getting sick. In New York City, reports say dozens of doctors are ill from coronavirus, including at least one physician intubated and on a respirator. The helpers desperately need help themselves. That is why several groups are working to get unused masks, gowns and other personal protection equipment [PPE]  items into the hands of the medical community by asking people for their unused items. ""I think it's absolutely shocking that we aren't able to support our health-care environment in this remarkably medically advanced nation,"" said Danielle Butin, the founder and CEO of the Afya Foundation, which since 2007 has distributed medical supplies and humanitarian aid to 72 countries around the globe. Now, the focus has been here at home. ""Afya"" means ""health"" in Swahili, and that's what the medical profession has needed right now. ""I'm getting emails that crack me in half from nurses and doctors who Afya loved to work with over 10 years, and they are saying, 'what do you have and what can you help us with?' Every single time one of those emails comes in, it's heart-wrenching."" Many people who normally wouldn't think they had the in-demand supplies, actually do. Painters, contractors, construction companies, nail salons, auto-body shops and so many other professions have relied on gear that now could be put to use to protect the nation's medical system. For example, The New York Historical Society donated all of its plastic gloves used by art handlers, to New York hospitals. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW On the other side of the country, in Oakland, Calif., two young entrepreneurs, Liz Klinger and Chloe Alpert, saw the sudden emergency -- and launched Mask Match. ""It's about getting masks [and] surgical masks out of people's cabinets, their garages, their workshops and getting them directly into the hands of the front-line health-care workers as soon as we can,"" Klinger told Fox News. She said she got the idea when her mother, a nurse, told her that the hospital had run out of masks. ""She was working on the floors and she told me they weren’t providing her or her coworkers any masks for them as they were taking care of their patients. That got me worried, especially because she’s over 65, she has some preexisting conditions and where she lives in California, she’s supposed to be quarantined, basically, by the state government's orders."" The pair got Mask Match up and running in 48 hours to distribute masks and protective gear directly from donors to doctors, nurses and clinics. Its website has offered an ""I need masks"" request form for health-care workers, and an ""I have masks"" for donors. The focus has been on smaller towns and cities that the larger drives could overlook.

And also, smaller rural clinics, their office managers just don't have the ability to order and make an order for masks for people in their community.""

"                          Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. President Trump signaled his support for the massive stimulus bill being ironed out in the Senate and called on Congress to immediately pass it and send it to him for his signature, as a prominent member of the president's taskforce warned Americans to prepare for the possibility of other coronavirus ""cycles"" in the future. “I encourage the House to pass this vital legislation,” Trump said Tuesday during a briefing of the White House coronavirus task force. “I will sign it immediately.” Trump’s comments come as the Senate is working out the final issues of the bill with a vote expected to occur later this evening after two failed attempts on the original version of the legislation earlier in the week. DO YOU QUALIFY FOR A STIMULUS CHECK IN SENATE’S CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE BILL? One part of the bill that Trump expressed support for during the press conference -- that came as a surprise to some -- is the bill's $25 million in funding for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington D.C. That is down from the $35 million that was included in the recent Democratic-proposed House legislation. Some conservatives have pointed to that as evidence that Democrats were trying to cram unrelated measures into the bill, but Trump said he backed its inclusion. “I’m a fan of that,” he said. “The Kennedy Center has suffered greatly.” While the president spent most of the press conference touting the Senate bill and talking about coronavirus, he also got into a testy exchange with a reporter over a tweet he sent out earlier in the day accusing the media wanting the economy shut down to hurt his re-election chances. ""The media would like to see me do poorly in the election,"" Trump charged. ""I think there are certain who would not like to see [the country] open quickly. I think there are a lot of people who would like to see the economy do poorly."" The back-and-forth comes a day after Trump said during a Fox News town hall that he believes the country can open back up by the Easter holiday. He has since slightly walked back the comment, saying now that the White House will reevaluate in April and that parts of the country less affected by the pandemic could be open sooner. Other members of the president's taskforce spoke to press on Thursday, including Dr. Deborah Birx, who recalled a family story of hers to pressure Americans to socially distance themselves. Birx said that her grandmother, as an 11-year-old, brought the Spanish flu home and infected and killed her great grandmother, who had just given birth. She added that her grandmother had to live with doing it for 88 years. Along with Birx, Dr. Anthony Fauci warned Americans that the coronavirus could come back in ""cycles"" like other pandemics have. ""We really need to be prepared for another cycle,"" Fauci said. As for the bill making its way through Congress, Democrats had claimed the earlier Senate bill did too much for large corporations and didn’t do enough for workers. Upon reaching an agreement with Republicans and the White House, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the bill amounts to “unemployment compensation on steroids,"" and that every American who is laid off will have their missed salary remunerated. That provision will enable companies to stay afloat and immediately bring back those employees when things are safe, Schumer said. Democrats said the package specifically would help replace the salaries of furloughed workers for four months, rather than the three months first proposed. Furloughed workers would get whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment, plus a $600 per week add-on, with gig workers like Uber drivers covered for the first time. The package also would give one-time payments of $1,200 per adult and $500 per child directly to the public. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP The massive economic relief package would provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines, given that Democrats wanted them to abide by new carbon emissions restrictions. Republicans also won inclusion of an ""employee retention"" tax credit that's estimated to provide $50 billion to companies that retain employees on payroll and cover 50 percent of workers' paychecks. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2 percent Social Security payroll tax. Other provisions in a related package, according to a summary, include $100 billion for direct aid to health care institutions battling the crisis; more than $4 billion to health agencies; $200 million to help nursing homes cope with the challenge; $45 billion for FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund; and $400 million in election assistance to help states expand early voting and vote-by-mail options. After earlier opposition, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi signaled tepid support Wednesday for the Senate’s package, saying the bipartisan deal has moved from “corporations-focused to workers-first” and her colleagues will review the plan. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW Even if it passes the upper chamber, support in the Democrat-controlled House is key. Pelosi had scrambled talks by pursuing a separate House bill that contained provisions Republicans decried as extraneous and political in nature. In a written statement, Pelosi indicated, however, she is open to the latest Senate version. “America is facing a grave health crisis with a serious impact on our economy. I salute the strong leadership of Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats,” she said Wednesday. “I especially thank our House Democratic Committee Chairmen, who worked hard to move the Republican proposal from corporations-focused to workers-first and who will now review the legislative text of this agreement with our Caucus.” Pelosi went on to say that the original Senate GOP legislation, which was blocked by Democrats twice in the Senate, “was a non-starter.” “This bipartisan legislation takes us a long way down the road in meeting the needs of the American people,” Pelosi said.

"                          New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's handling of the coronavirus outbreak in his state has wowed some Democrats; reaction and analysis from Fox News contributor Byron York and Mike Huckabee. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is grabbing plenty of attention.  He's warned that the coronavirus outbreak is spreading as fast as “a bullet train” and stressed that tens of thousands of New Yorkers “are going to die” unless President Trump and the federal government speed up delivery of promised ventilators. The three-term governor of the state that, by far, has been the hardest hit by the pandemic has become an instant national media star and the politician of the moment. Cuomo’s style at daily coronavirus briefings, which the national cable networks carry live, are garnering bipartisan praise for his tempered disposition – a vivid contrast to President Trump’s occasional and controversial verbal fistfights with some reporters. CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW  And Cuomo’s grabbing plenty of positive headlines. “How Cuomo, once on sidelines, became the politician of the moment,” read a recent headline from the New York Times. A CNN analysis was titled “Everyone needs to see Andrew Cuomo’s inspiring words on the fight against coronavirus.” And a GQ headline read “In a moment of information overload, Governor Andrew Cuomo dresses for facts only.” Even conservative outlets are also praising the three-term governor. The New York Post spotlighted that “#PresidentCuomo trends as governor’s star status rises over coronavirus response.” And the National Review asked “Could a ‘Draft Cuomo’ movement be in the Democrats' future?” The media blitz comes as former Vice President Joe Biden – the all-but-certain Democratic presidential nominee – struggles to increase his media footprint that was instantly erased last week as the coronavirus outbreak wiped the White House race from the headlines and froze the Democratic nomination battle in place. Without any formal current role in government, Biden has no direct role in combating the crisis and has been overshadowed both by Trump’s daily briefings as well as Cuomo’s meteoric media rise in recent days. BIDEN TEMPERS ATTACKS ON TRUMP AS CORONAVIRUS CRISIS BUILDS But add Biden to the growing list of people praising Cuomo over the past week. The former vice president’s repeatedly given the New York governor shoutouts since Friday. “#DraftCuomo” and “#AndrewforAmerica” hashtags have also popped up on Twitter and there’s now a @DraftCuomo2020 Twitter handle. But talk of a potential Cuomo draft movement is just talk right now. Cuomo’s brushed aside campaign hypotheticals as he combats the coronavirus in his state and the odds against him getting drafted as his party’s presidential nominee are daunting at this moment. End of debates? Biden says he’s “had enough” of the Democratic presidential primary debates and that it’s time to “get on with this.” Asked on a conference call Wednesday with reporters if there should be another primary debate in April – Biden answered that “my focus is just dealing with this crisis right now. I haven’t thought about any more debates. I think we’ve had enough debates. I think we should get on with this.” Biden’s comments came one day after the campaign of the only other remaining Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, told The New York Times that if there’s a Democratic presidential primary debate in April, their candidate expects to participate. Read the full story here. Biden's Green push The former vice president – during his briefing with reporters on Wednesday – seemed to call for including climate change legislation in the next bill Congress passes to jump-start an economy flattened by the coronavirus outbreak as many Americans huddle at home in order to prevent the spread of the pandemic. “We’re going to have an opportunity, I believe, in the next round [of economic aid] here to use…my Green Deal to be able to generate both economic growth as consistent with the kind of infusion of monies we need into the system to keep it going,” Biden said. Last year, as he unveiled his plan to combat climate change, Biden embraced parts of the ""Green New Deal,"" the massive framework authored by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts that’s been praised by progressives and lambasted by conservatives. President Trump’s reelection campaign on Wednesday quickly jabbed at Biden, tweeting that “Joe Biden wants to 'use' the #coronavirus crisis as an 'opportunity' to pass his version of the #GreenNewDeal in the 'next round' of emergency legislation.” Toning things down? Biden continues to take aim President Trump’s response to the coronavirus outbreak. But he has seemingly tempered his comments this week compared to the language he used just a few days ago. “The American people are rising to meet this moment. We need our president to do the same,” the all-but-certain Democratic presidential nominee wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. Biden’s repeatedly called out Trump for what many critics charge is a continued downplaying of the severity of the pandemic. But compare that to how Biden – on a conference call with reporters on Friday -- urged Trump to “stop saying false things,"" saying, ""People are worried. They are really frightened. And when these things don’t come true, you just exacerbate their concern. Stop saying false things [you] think make you sound like a hero.” Read the full story here    ",         Democracy 2020 Digest Cuomo's profile rises amid coronavirus storm,         2020-03-25T172826-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/democracy-2020-digest-cuomos-profile-rises-amid-coronavirus-storm,Fox
"                          The $2.2 trillion coronavirus economic stimulus bill gains more than the 60 votes needed to pass the U.S. Senate; congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports from Capitol Hill. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. By a vote of 96-0, the Senate passed a massive $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus compromise package just before midnight Wednesday, ending days of deadlock and sending the bill to the House of Representatives -- which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said will soon take up the historic measure to bring relief to individuals, small businesses, and larger corporations ""with strong bipartisan support."" The 880-page legislation is the largest economic relief bill in U.S. history. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., appeared somber and exhausted as he announced the vote. He released senators from Washington until April 20, though he promised to recall them if needed. ""96-0 in the United States Senate,"" President Trump wrote on Twitter. ""Congratulations AMERICA!"" The unanimous vote came despite misgivings on both sides about whether it goes too far or not far enough. The vote capped days of difficult negotiations as Washington confronted a national challenge unlike any it has ever faced. Unemployment numbers were set to be revealed Thursday morning, and experts warned they could reach alarming new highs. The package would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year, and $2,400 to married couples making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child. After a $75,000 threshold for individuals, the benefit would be reduced by $5 for each $100 the taxpayer makes. A similar $150,000 threshold applies to couples, and a $112,500 threshold for heads of households. READ THE FINAL BILL; READ A SUMMARY OF THE BILL ; READ THE SASSE AMENDMENT The legislation passed by the Senate will use 2019 tax returns, if available, or 2018 tax returns to assess income for determining how much direct financial aid individuals receive. Those who did not file tax returns can use a Form SSA-1099, Social Security Benefit Statement or Form RRB-1099, a Social Security Equivalent Benefit Statement, per Page 149 of the bill.

The 2 trillion dollar stimulus bill is expected to be voted on in the Senate Wednesday. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)       Further, the bill allocates $250 billion to extend unemployment insurance to more workers, and lengthen the duration to 39 weeks, up from the normal 26 weeks. $600 extra a week would be provided for four months. (Just before voting on the final package began late Wednesday, the Senate was debating an amendment from Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., to bar people from getting more from new unemployment benefits than they would have received on the job; the amendment needed 60 votes and failed 48-48.) The final package would additionally provide $349 billion in loans to small businesses -- and money spent on rent, payroll and utilities becomes grants that don't need to be paid back. Many hotels would qualify as small businesses under the plan. Passenger airlines would receive $25 billion for workers' ""salaries and benefits,"" plus up to $25 billion more in loan guarantees and loans. Contract workers would also receive $3 billion in assistance. Airlines would have to agree not to furlough workers until at least the end of September in return. WHO QUALIFIES FOR A CHECK? About $17 billion will go to other distressed companies like Boeing, which is seen as essential to national security. And, approximately $200 billion would be provided in tax assistance to small businesses, including through payroll tax deferrals. At the same time, the bill omits many -- though not all -- items from Pelosi's version of the legislation that Republicans had called wasteful or irrelevant, including climate-change-related emissions restrictions for airlines and various diversity-related provisions.       House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of Calif. speaks outside her office on Capitol Hill, Monday, March 23, 2020. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, Pool)       Gone from the stimulus bill are mentions of mandatory early voting, ballot harvesting, requirements that federal agencies review their usage of ""minority banks,"" and attempts to curb airlines' carbon emissions -- a Pelosi demand that even Saikat Chakrabarti, the former chief of staff to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and an author of the Green New Deal, called ""ridiculous."" ""What's not in the Senate's bipartisan coronavirus bill: Pelosi's outrageous wish list,"" wrote GOP national spokesperson Elizabeth Harrington. ""0 mentions of 'diversity.' 0 mentions of 'emissions.' 0 mentions of 'early voting.' 0 mentions of 'climate change.' Good!"" But, the package still contained some wins for Pelosi. Page 524 of the bill text indicates that many businesses that take a government loan would be obligated to remain neutral in any ""union organizing effort"" during the loan -- a major giveaway to unions. Affected businesses would have between 500 and 10,000 employees. And, Page 781 of the bill provides $25 million to the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives to cover ""salary and expenses."" Also in the final bill text, $25 million would still be allocated for the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Trump, speaking at the White House coronavirus briefing earlier Wednesday, said that he understood the provision was necessary because Democrats demanded some concessions in order to get the stimulus bill passed, even though it galled some conservatives. Pelosi was the first to demand the Kennedy Center money in her own bill, which Republicans said was full of unseemly payouts for well-connected special interests at a time of national crisis. The Kennedy Center put out a statement Wednesday evening saying it was ""extraordinarily grateful that Congress has recognized our institution's unique status and has included funding in its legislation to ensure that we can reopen our doors and stages as soon as we are able."" ""For an opera house, you sure are tone-deaf,"" responded blogger Jim Treacher, after telling the Kennedy Center where to shove its statement.       John F. Kennedy Center for Performing Arts shot at dusk across the Potomac in Georgetown       Meanwhile, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said the House would vote on the matter on Friday. Republican leaders said they'd whip votes to support the bill. ""Over the past few days, the Senate has stepped into the breach,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in his own remarks. ""We packed weeks or perhaps months of the legislative process into five days. Representatives from both sides of the aisle and both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue have forged a bipartisan agreement in highly partisan times, with very little time to spare."" He added: ""It’s been a long, hard road, with a remarkable number of twists and turns, but for the sake of millions of Americans, it will be worth it. It will be worth it to get help to millions of small businesses and save tens of millions of jobs."" However, earlier in the day, a senior GOP source told Fox News contributor and Townhall.com editor Guy Benson that the compromise bill was a face-saving exercise by Schumer, and that he was trying to ""take credit"" for a GOP bill that he filibustered for ""small ball"" alterations. Democrats, the source said, couldn't drag the situation out much longer; economic conditions have worsened dramatically, and President Trump's approval rating has risen. Stocks rally after Senate reaches deal on stimulus; White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow weighs in. And, a senior Republican aide separately told Fox News: ""I half expected that the next thing I read would be the Minority Leader taking credit for inventing fire. The reality is that almost every significant 'win' he's taking credit for, is actually a Senate Republican idea."" Republicans had ""never objected"" to more hospital funding, or that oversight of the stimulus stabilization fund ""be structured almost exactly like TARP oversight,"" the aide went on. And Republicans were the first to push for three months of unemployment insurance and ""did not oppose adding a fourth."" The stimulus movement came as stocks posted their first back-to-back gains in weeks, but much of Wednesday's early rally faded as the hitch developed in the Senate. The market is down nearly 27 percent since setting a record high a month ago. Amid the debate, presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders said he might try to torpedo the Senate's stimulus package as Republican senators raised objections about what they called a ""massive drafting error"" related to unemployment benefits. “In my view, it would be an outrage to prevent working-class Americans to receive the emergency unemployment assistance included in this legislation,"" Sanders said in a statement, also posted on social media. Sanders took to the Senate floor late Wednesday at approximately 9:30 p.m. ET to say he was concerned that the administration would be able to ""expend $500 billion in virtually any way they want"" under the legislation. In fact, the administration would not have such unilateral control. DO YOU QUALIFY FOR A STIMULUS CHECK? ""They're very upset that somebody who is making 10, 12 bucks an hour might end up with a paycheck for four months more than they received last week,"" Sanders went on. ""Oh, my god, the universe is collapsing!"" The concern from Sens. Lindsey Graham, Tim Scott, R-S.C., Sasse, and Rick Scott, R-Fla., was that the the bill could pay workers more in unemployment benefits than they'd make in salary, by sticking a $600 per week payment on top of ordinary benefits that are calculated as a percentage of income. Democrats and economists have countered that the point of the new unemployment benefit is, in fact, to make peoples' salaries whole, and that companies could simply raise wages to compete and attract workers. ""The weird thing about this hypothetical 'generous unemployment pay will discourage people from entering critical industries' is... they could just raise wages?"" Alex Godofsky wrote on Twitter. ""Amazon has already raised wages. Like, it's okay if wages - and prices - go up for a while. It's fine."" Others have noted that the unemployment benefits boost would expire in the summer. In an article entitled ""Republican Senators’ Objection to Expanded Unemployment Benefits Makes Little Sense,"" Josh Barro began by noting that ""these are unemployment benefits, and you generally have to have been laid off to claim them."" ""We will continue to have virus-mitigation measures that create mass unemployment for a significant period, and even after those measures can be relaxed through much of the country, it will take some time for employers to re-ingest all the previously laid-off workers,"" Barro wrote. ""In fact, it’s likely that the shutdowns will persist long enough that the enhanced benefits will need to be extended. If we’re in a situation by July where all the shutdowns are over and employers are eagerly hiring and our biggest concern is too many people don’t want to go back to work, I will be overjoyed and very surprised."" Later Wednesday, the Republicans agreed to drop their objections to fast-tracking the stimulus vote, as long as there was first a vote on the Sasse amendment to cap unemployment benefits to 100 percent of salary. Also in the evening, Pelosi said unanimous consent was a nonstarter in the House, and implied that quick passage in the lower chamber may be unrealistic. Pelosi has called for members to have at least 24 hours to review the bill text once it's available.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)       “That’s not gonna work,"" she told reporters shortly after 7:30 p.m. ET, referring to unanimous consent. ""Republicans have told us that’s not possible from their said. ... What I’d like to see -- because this a $2 trillion bill -- I’d like to see a good debate on the floor."" Meanwhile, the White House projected confidence. Insistently optimistic, President Trump said of the greatest public-health emergency in anyone's lifetime, ""I don’t think it's going to end up being such a rough patch"" and anticipated the economy soaring “like a rocket ship” when it's over. Yet he implored Congress late in the day to move on critical aid without further delay. The package is intended as relief for an economy spiraling into recession or worse and a nation facing a grim toll from an infection that's killed nearly 20,000 people worldwide. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, asked how long the aid would keep the economy afloat, said: “We’ve anticipated three months. Hopefully, we won’t need this for three months."" Underscoring the effort's sheer magnitude, the bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion annual federal budget.

As coronavirus cases start to overwhelm U.S. hospitals, American companies say they're starting to make face masks and other personal protective equipment critically needed by medical staff. In Minnesota, the MyPillow company is refocusing 75 percent of its production to face masks for health care workers. ""We have capacity to make a lot of things at big rates and we’re going to be going hopefully from 10,000 units a day to 50,000 units a day in a very short period of time,"" CEO Mike Lindell told FOX 9 of Minneapolis-St. Paul. Coronavirus relief: Fashion brands pledge to produce face masks for medical supply The masks will go to hospitals in Minnesota and other states, he said. MyPillow worked the Trump administration to get the proper design, Lindell told FOX 9. In New Jersey, Stuart Carlitz, president and CEO of mattress company Eclipse International, said he made the decision to switch production to masks last week after hearing New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo say that state had a shortage and was paying high prices for masks. “My first thought was that’s really terrible that people would take advantage of this time to profit,” he said, according to NJ.com. He said he realized one of the materials used in face masks is also used in his mattresses. He ordered the other materials and is ready to start production. The company is making an initial batch of 38,000 masks, which will be donated to a hospital in New Brunswick, N.J., where the factory is located. “I’m not trying to sell masks,” Carlitz said. “Whether it’s a dollar apiece or four dollars apiece, that’s not going to change my business. I’m going to donate the masks.” “I’m not trying to sell masks. Whether it’s a dollar apiece or four dollars apiece, that’s not going to change my business.

Los Angeles-based apron company Hedley &Bennett will also be putting its 30 factory employees to work on face masks. Owner Ellen Bennett said she was inspired after hearing fashion designer Christian Siriano had directed his seamstresses to start manufacturing them.  “I’ve always been a wake-up-and-fight kind of a girl. And I thought, ‘This is game time,’” Bennett said, according to Fast Company magazine.

"                          Joe Biden addresses the future of presidential debates amid the coronavirus pandemic. Former Vice President Joe Biden appeared to have made some factual errors during a virtual roundtable on Wednesday regarding this claim that he ""became a professor"" after leaving the Senate. During an online campaign event, Biden took questions from young people and while discussing the student debt crisis, Biden spoke about all the time he had spent on ""campus."" ""When I left the United States Senate, I became a professor at the University of Pennsylvania,"" Biden said. ""And I've spent a lot of time -- and the University of Delaware has the Biden School as well, so I've spent a lot of time on campus with college students."" Biden, quite notably, became vice president of the United States under President Obama when he left the Senate in 2009. It was, however, in 2017 when he received the title of ""Benjamin Franklin Presidential Practice Professor"" from the University of Pennsylvania. CNN'S JAKE TAPPER TEACHES BIDEN HOW TO COUGH PROPERLY IN AWKWARD INTERVIEW MOMENT According to The Daily Pennsylvania, the university opened the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement in Washington, D.C., outside of its campus as part of the professorship.

Bernie Sanders said Wednesday afternoon he might torpedo the Senate's compromise stimulus package unless Republican senators dropped their objections about what they called a ""massive drafting error"" related to unemployment benefits, in the latest twist to a process that has been marked by delays and last-minute hurdles. “In my view, it would be an outrage to prevent working-class Americans to receive the emergency unemployment assistance included in this legislation,"" Sanders said in a statement, also posted on social media. ""Unless these Republican Senators drop their objections, I am prepared to put a hold on this bill until stronger conditions are imposed on the $500 billion corporate welfare fund to make sure that any corporation receiving financial assistance under this legislation does not lay off workers, cut wages or benefits, ship jobs overseas, or pay workers poverty wages,"" he continued. An objection by a single senator would prevent the Senate from quickly passing the bill by unanimous consent, although it remained possible that the chamber could pass the legislation by voice vote or roll-call vote. Fox News is told lawmakers are leaning toward approving the bill via voice vote, in which senators in the chamber shout ""aye"" or ""nay,"" with the loudest side winning. Then, late Wednesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said unanimous consent was a nonstarter in the House, and implied that quick passage in the lower chamber may be unrealistic. Pelosi has called for members to have at least 24 hours to review the bill text once it's available. “That’s not gonna work,"" she told reporters shortly after 7:30 p.m. ET, referring to unanimous consent. ""Republicans have told us that’s not possible from their said. ... What I’d like to see -- because this a $2 trillion bill -- I’d like to see a good debate on the floor."" ""What I’d like to see -- because this a $2 trillion bill -- I’d like to see a good debate on the floor."" Pelosi said that implementing proxy voting was a possibility, but that it was an ""overwhelming"" sentiment among Democrats that they wanted to come back to Capitol Hill to debate and vote. Fox News has been told repeatedly in the 6 p.m. ET hour that the “hope” continues to be to advance the bill for a vote Wednesday night in the Senate. But, the Senate still doesn't have bill text, nearly 18 hours after an agreement was announced at around 1 a.m. ET Wednesday morning. Even then, senators would still have to agree as to how to handle the bill on the floor -- dictating whether there is any debate, amendments and how or when senators would actually vote on the measure. The upshot is that a House vote may be delayed to Friday at the earliest. The concern from Sens. Lindsey Graham, Tim Scott, R-S.C., Ben Sasse, R-Neb., and Rick Scott, R-Fla., is that the current version of the bill could pay workers more in unemployment benefits than they'd make in salary, by sticking a $600 per week payment on top of ordinary benefits that are calculated as a percentage of income. This could disrupt the labor market further, the lawmakers warn. Graham shot back at Sanders' latest warning in a series of posts on Twitter. ""Only in Senator @BernieSanders  world does it make sense to pay people more NOT to work than TO work,"" Graham wrote. ""I am all for making peoples salaries whole. However, I am not for increasing people’s salary through the unemployment insurance system."" Democrats and economists have countered that the point of the new unemployment benefit is, in fact, to make peoples' salaries whole, and that companies could simply raise wages to compete and attract workers. ""The weird thing about this hypothetical 'generous unemployment pay will discourage people from entering critical industries' is... they could just raise wages?"" Alex Godofsky wrote on Twitter. ""Amazon has already raised wages. Like, it's okay if wages - and prices - go up for a while. It's fine."" Others have noted that the unemployment benefit boost would expire in the summer. In an article entitled ""Republican Senators’ Objection to Expanded Unemployment Benefits Makes Little Sense,"" Josh Barro began by noting that ""these are unemployment benefits, and you generally have to have been laid off to claim them."" ""We will continue to have virus-mitigation measures that create mass unemployment for a significant period, and even after those measures can be relaxed through much of the country, it will take some time for employers to re-ingest all the previously laid-off workers,"" Barro wrote. ""In fact, it’s likely that the shutdowns will persist long enough that the enhanced benefits will need to be extended. If we’re in a situation by July where all the shutdowns are over and employers are eagerly hiring and our biggest concern is too many people don’t want to go back to work, I will be overjoyed and very surprised."" But, Graham has nevertheless suggested a larger problem. ""This proposal will make it hard for our employers to maintain their workforce, particularly in the area of healthcare, thus, significantly delaying the economic recovery and impairing our health and safety,"" Graham said. ""Simple Fix: Cap unemployment benefits at full salary before the crisis."" The Republicans have said they will oppose fast-tracking the $2 trillion coronavirus response package unless what they called the “massive drafting error” in the legislation, which they say would create an incentive for employers to lay off employees, is fixed. DEM BILL CONTAINS HUGE GIVEAWAY FOR UNIONS, ARTS CENTERS, BIG BIRD ""You want to destroy what's left of the economy? Pass it the way it’s written,"" Graham, R-S.C., said in a press conference. ""If you want to help people, pay them their wages, but don’t pay them more not to work."" ""A massive drafting error in the current version of the coronavirus relief legislation could have devastating consequences: Unless this bill is fixed, there is a strong incentive for employees to be laid off instead of going to work. This isn’t an abstract, philosophical point -- it’s an immediate, real-world problem,” Tim Scott, Sasse and Graham said in a statement. The White House and Senate leaders had come to an agreement on the $2 trillion package that is designed to boost the economy and provide aid to workers and businesses affected by the closing down of much of daily life in response to the coronavirus crisis. Leaders have emphasized the urgency of getting the package passed as quickly as possible in order to get assistance to Americans in need. HOW SENATE'S CORONAVIRUS BILL BOOSTS UNEMPLOYMENT AID ; PELOSI INDICATES SUPPORT FOR SENATE'S NEW CORONAVIRUS BILL, AS DETAILS EMERGE In the press conference, Scott gave the example of someone in South Carolina making $20 an hour, or $800 a week, who could get up to $326 of unemployment benefits in the state, followed by another $600 a week in the federal benefit, meaning they would be earning more than their normal salary. ""This legislation would not stop at 100 percent of your income, this legislation would allow you in unemployment to make more than you do in employment,"" Scott said. ""We know that that is a drafting error and we are simply providing an amendment to fix that so you do not make more in unemployment than you do when you're working."" ""Under this proposal ... under unemployment you’d be making $24.07 an hour in South Carolina,"" Graham said. ""There are a lot of jobs that in South Carolina don't pay $24.07 an hour."" Graham also opened the door to the possibility that this was not a drafting error but said he was ""concerned"" that it was the explicit intention of Democrats. ""If this is not a drafting error then it's the worst idea I've seen in a long time and that's saying a lot given the fact that we’re in Washington,"" he said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The lawmakers instead are working on an amendment to fix the ""problem"" by making the unemployment benefit 100 percent of someone's salary. Graham said they would soon know whether or not it was a drafting error by whether or not their amendment is opposed by Democrats in the chamber. Fox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.

They’re scared. They’re scared for the country. They’re scared for the people they represent. They’re scared for themselves. There’s a reason a verbal melee erupted inside the Senate chamber Monday afternoon. Senators traded barbs and vocally brawled as the Senate struggled to approve the latest legislative measure to combat the coronavirus. Lawmakers are stressed about not getting the bill done. They’re stressed about their continued presence in the Capitol complex, day after day, night after night. They’re fretting they’re converting the place into the legislative equivalent of a daycare center full of contagious toddlers the week after Christmas. The lawmakers worry they’re making one another sick as they linger in the same marble corridors, Senate office buildings and the Senate chamber itself. DO YOU QUALIFY FOR A STIMULUS CHECK IN SENATE’S CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE BILL? Tempers crescendoed and senators spewed rhetorical venom at one another because anxiety spiked this week. The U.S. has never quite fought an enemy like coronavirus. The U.S. Capitol is simply a soundstage for American history. It plays out under the Capitol Dome. And that’s why such invective commandeered the Senate floor this week. That’s what’s going on in the country. There’s fear. There’s dread. There’s concern. And it’s reflected in the U.S. Capitol. We have representative government. It had been 25 years since such oratorical rancor seized the Senate floor like Monday. You may have to go back to a verbal scrape between then-Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., and former Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., over the Balanced Budget Amendment in 1995 to find such acrimony in the U.S. Senate. It’s not uncommon for floor fights in the rowdier, much larger House of Representatives. But things are typically calmer and more polite in the U.S. Senate. But this is Congress in the time of Coronavirus. That’s why Monday was unique. To wit: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., angrily excoriated House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). “We have been fiddling around!” charged McConnell, angrily engaging Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., across the room. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., blocked Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, from speaking on the floor. “Unbelievable!” said an exasperated Collins, disgusted at how badly decorum deteriorated. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., presided over part of the verbal melee from the dais. “Reserving the right to object!” thundered Schumer. “There is not right to reserve the right to object!” responded Sasse. “I have the floor!” asserted the New York Democrat. “No! You do not!” shouted Sasse at Schumer. Senators cursed so loudly in the rear of the chamber, that their profanity made it onto the Senate’s video and audio feed. Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., the most-vulnerable Democrat running for re-election this cycle, sided with Democrats on a procedural vote Sunday related to the coronavirus bill. By Monday, Jones was fed up. “Do you think that was a good look for the United States government to see people acting like a bunch of kindergartners sniping at each other?” asked Jones. “What happened on the floor of the United States Senate earlier today was just embarrassing for everybody.” This may have been inevitable. Congress talks a lot about “must pass” bills. But there has never have been a “must pass” bill like this one in American history. The measure may prove to be the largest and potentially most-crucial piece of legislation in U.S. history. At Tuesday’s White House briefing, economic adviser Larry Kudlow described the price tag of the coronavirus phase three bill as clocking in around $6 trillion. Now, to be clear, that isn’t all new money. Kudlow noted that about $4 trillion accounted for liquidity measures taken by the Federal Reserve. Some of the money in the legislation deals with loans. Less than $2 trillion amounts for “new” money. But that is still a staggering bill in its raw size. Consider that Congress approved $8.3 billion for NIH and the CDC in the phase one coronavirus bill. No one truly knows the cost of the second coronavirus response. However, the family leave portion alone costs $104 billion. The government spends a grand total of around $4.3 trillion each year. More than 70 percent of that goes toward entitlements. The remaining $1.3 trillion is what Congress allocates each year in its annual appropriations bills. Large chunks of the bill go toward loans and other fiscal guarantees. But the size of this legislation - coupled with the other two bills – dwarfs what Congress spends each year. Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., signaled this week that work is already starting on a phase four bill. Who knows how big that will be. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW The Senate hoped to vote on the measure early this week. Then Tuesday night. Then during the day on Wednesday. As they say on Capitol Hill, nothing is decided until everything is decided. Nothing was going to happen until the Senate finally settled on concrete bill text – even though the White House and Senate Republican and Democratic leaders announced an agreement in the wee hours of Wednesday morning. Lawmakers and aides struggled with drafting the legislation. They were doing so on the fly – authoring monumental provisions at lightning speed. That’s why there were problems making sure the language was right. It’s now more likely the House doesn’t touch the plan until Friday – if not later. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., wrote to all House members on Wednesday, declaring “I remain committed to giving House members 24 hours notice before the House acts.” The House met briefly Wednesday morning for a short session and gaveled out immediately. This may seem counterintuitive. But stretching this out in the House could save time in the long run. Consider this: If the Senate wasn’t ready, why should the House commit? That’s the same reason the Senate cut town two weeks ago as the House struggled to finalize the coronavirus phase two bill. Calling the House back into session immediately could do more harm than good if the House wants to move fast. House leaders on both sides of the aisle are taking time to walk their respective members through the legislation to make sure that there is buy-in. House Republicans have already signaled lots of support for the bill – now bragging that they beat back many extraneous provisions pitched by Pelosi. And, many priorities important to House Democrats are already tucked in the legislation. Schumer continued to engage Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin at length. Part of Schumer’s negotiating was on behalf of Pelosi. That will make it easier for Pelosi to sell the plan to her caucus. Senate passage will send a strong, strong signal to the House that the bill is “ok” for members to support it on both sides of the aisle. As we’ve written in this space before, recall the old Life Cereal commercials. Remember that none of the kids would eat the cereal until “Mikey” tried it. Once Mikey ate it, all of the other kids jumped in. Congress works in a similar fashion. Once one body passes a bill, that legislation is much more palatable to the other chamber. But it’s unclear how the House will vote on the measure. It is unlikely that the House will conduct a regular roll call vote where they bring all 430 current members back to the chamber to vote. There are health risks. There are three ways both the House and Senate approve bills, resolutions and amendments: None of these methods are strange or weird. The House and Senate pass and defeat items all the time via all three methods. But the question is whether the House and Senate should vote on arguably the biggest bill in American history without a regular roll call vote. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., argued he may prefer the House to approve the bill via voice vote. That’s where everyone in the chamber (probably a smaller group) shouts aye and those opposed nay. The loudest side wins. That way, those who at least want to show up can say they tried to oppose the measure. The speaker presiding over the chamber decides which side is the most boisterous. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Interestingly, McCarthy asserted that the Senate should have approved the bill days ago, criticizing Democrats. But McCarthy pushed for at least a day pause so the House could consider the plan. There is also consternation about how long the process is taking. McConnell introduced the original version of this bill during the middle of last week. A bicameral legislative process involving up to 535 people was not designed for speed. What you are witnessing is Congress moving as fast as it can: writing a gigantic bill. Getting triple sign off from the Democratically controlled House, the Republican-controlled Senate and the Republican-controlled White House. Then, running all of the requisite parliamentary traps of advancing the package through not one but two houses of Congress. And that’s why things are so tense. There’s pressure. There’s fear. There’s alarm. Not just around the country. But inside the walls of the U.S. Capitol.

President Trump's reelection campaign sent cease and desist letters to local news outlets on Wednesday threatening legal action if they refused to stop airing a Democratic super PAC's ad suggesting the president called the coronavirus a ""hoax."" Priorities USA, led by a former adviser to Hillary Clinton, released the ad as part of a $6 million effort to attack Trump's response to the pandemic. Titled ""Exponential Threat,"" it followed other ads in splicing together Trump's statements to make it appear as though he said: ""The coronavirus, this is their new hoax."" According to The Washington Post, Trump never made that exact statement but it was included in another ad released by former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign. The Post also determined that Trump wasn't calling the virus itself a hoax. TOP DEM SUPER PAC ROLLING OUT $6M IN ADS ATTACKING TRUMP'S CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE The campaign highlighted the Post's fact check along with others in the letters sent to local news outlets. ""Should you fail to immediately cease broadcasting PUSA’s ad 'Exponential Threat,' Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. will have no choice but to pursue all legal remedies available to it in law and in equity; we will not stand idly by and allow you to broadcast false, deceptive, and misleading information concerning President’s Trump’s healthcare positions without consequence,"" read the letters, signed by campaign attorney Alex W. Cannon. According to the campaign, the local stations bore unique responsibility since they weren't required to broadcast PUSA's ad like they are with ads paid for by candidate committees. ""PUSA’s advertisement is false, misleading, and deceptive, and we formally demand that your station refuse to continue airing it to meet your responsibilities not to broadcast false information,"" the letter read, ""Unlike candidate committees, PUSA does not have a 'right to command the use of broadcast facilities.'"" The campaign further warned that failure to remove the ad could put stations' licenses in jeopardy. Trump's team previously asked Twitter to flag a nearly identical ad to Priorities USA's, but the social media giant refused. ""Fellow Americans,"" a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, ran the ad but it's unclear where the group originated. Its website is relatively sparse and vaguely refers to opposing political division in the United States.  Both ads splice together Trump's statements while displaying a chart that shows the increasing number of coronavirus cases in the United States. LATEST ANTI-TRUMP AD PASSES TWITTER SCRUTINY AS DARK MONEY TARGETS PANDEMIC RESPONSE PUSA's ad followed those from other Democrat-aligned groups who sought to criticize Trump's coronavirus response. A PAC tied to former Obama aide David Plouffe is also planning to spend millions in attack ads targeting several key swing states. Americans for Public Trust, an outside group led by former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt, a Republican, is claiming that similar anti-Trump messaging is coming from a series of organizations tied to Arabella Advisors -- a dark money nonprofit providing help to liberal groups. Specifically, it houses the New Venture Fund and Sixteen Thirty Fund, both of which have supported another Democrat-aligned group -- American Bridge -- that's hitting Trump on the coronavirus response. The New Venture Fund has also supported Acronym, the nonprofit led by Plouffe. New Venture Fund previously distanced itself from Pacronym, telling Fox News it had ""nothing to do"" with the group's ad. Guy Cecil, a former adviser to Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign, leads PUSA, which was created by former campaign officials for Barack Obama. The group also has received funding from liberal billionaire George Soros. JOE BIDEN SAYS TRUMP NEEDED TO MOVE FASTER ON CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE Other former advisers to top Democrats have also started a ""coronavirus war room"" at Protect Our Care, an organization which as been described as a project of the Sixteen Thirty Fund. According to the group's director, the war room was designed to hold Trump ""accountable for his failure to lead"" during the pandemic. Heading the war room is Zac Petkanas, a former adviser to Hillary Clinton and former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Sarah Chase, a former research associate for the presidential campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., is joining the team as well. Fox News previously reported on how multiple media outlets omitted context surrounding Trump's comments to his rally audience in February.

"                          GOP Doctors Caucus member Rep. Earl Carter weighs in on the coronavirus stimulus bill. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. The Senate emergency stimulus compromise package allocates $75 million for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), the nonprofit that funds National Public Radio (NPR), offers programming featuring the children's character ""Big Bird"" and supports other public stations. The massive payout -- which the draft bill says would ""make fiscal stabilization grants to public television and radio stations facing declines in non-federal revenues"" -- is less than the $300 million that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., had proposed in her own coronavirus stimulus proposal. The money nevertheless drew complaints from conservatives, who called the spending unrelated to the coronavirus, and who have long accused NPR of overt political bias. President Trump has repeatedly called for Congress to cut all funding for CPB in his budget requests. On Tuesday, a Washington state NPR station said it would stop airing Trump's coronavirus briefings because they could not be fact-checked ""in real-time."" ""That's why the Dems felt it was CRUCIAL to fund NPR in the coronavirus stimulus bill,"" mused conservative commentator Ann Coulter. WHAT KIND OF PET PELOSI PROJECTS WERE IN DEMS' BILL? The CPB was created under President Lyndon Johnson in 1967. In 2012, then-candidate Mitt Romney remarked during a PBS presidential debate: “I'm going to stop the subsidy to PBS. I'm going to stop other things. I like PBS, I love Big Bird. Actually like you, too. But I'm not going to -- I'm not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for.” ""Let's focus on addressing the problem and fighting the virus, not liberal pet projects,"" said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, referring to Pelosi's call to fund CPB with stimulus money. ""Congress is run by morons,"" wrote The Federalist co-founder Sean Davis. ""This bill should've been one page -- everyone gets a check and they'll be taxed on it in 2021 based on what they earned in 2020 (people who don't need it will pay it back) -- and it should've taken all of a day to enact."" The stimulus package's appropriations text, released Wednesday along with the draft bill itself, also includes $25 million in funding for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington D.C. That is down from the $35 million that was included in the recent Democratic-proposed House legislation. $25 million is also conspicuously allocated for the House of Representatives' own operating expenses, including salaries, in Democrats' proposal. Additionally, in a major win for unions, the bill provides that businesses with 500 to 10,000 employees can't oppose union organizing efforts if they take a Treasury loan. PELOSI INDICATES SUPPORT FOR SENATE'S NEW CORONAVIRUS BILL, AS DETAILS EMERGE The Senate bill further provides $75 million to each the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. That is down from the $300 million for each that was in the House stimulus bill. That $25 million for the Kennedy Center is designated to helping the center ""prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus, domestically or internationally, including deep cleaning and information technology to improve telework capability and for operations and maintenance requirements related to the consequences of coronavirus."" Still, a senior Republican aide told Fox News that the GOP had blocked some pork from the final bill draft. ""Senate Republicans blocked Senate Democrat attempt to insert tax schemes that would have benefited renewable energy over fossil fuels,"" the aide said. ""Senate Democrats prioritized their ideological greenhouse gas obsession over emergency health and economic needs of the nation."" The aide added: ""Senator Schumer wanted the funding for states and municipalities to have virtually no-strings attached. That would mean fiscally irresponsible states would have been able to use money from the CARES Act to pay for non-Coronavirus related expenses. Senate Republicans held firm though and mandated that by April 1st, all funding must be used for coronavirus-related expense."" An unnecessary bailout for the U.S. Postal Service was also averted, the source said. The Senate stimulus package is expected to receive a vote soon in the Senate as soon as Wednesday. The House will then consider the legislation, likely on Thursday. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW However, four Republican senators were warning Wednesday afternoon that they will oppose fast-tracking the $2 trillion coronavirus response package unless a “massive drafting error” in the legislation, which they say would create an incentive for employers to lay off employees, is fixed. ""You want to destroy what's left of the economy? Pass it the way it’s written,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in a press conference. ""If you want to help people, pay them their wages, but don’t pay them more not to work."" The concern from Sens. Graham, Tim Scott, R-S.C., Ben Sasse, R-Neb., and Rick Scott, R-Fla., is that the current version could pay workers more in unemployment benefits than they're currently making, by sticking a $600 per week payment on top of ordinary benefits that are calculated as a percentage of income. This could disrupt the labor market further, the lawmakers warn. Fox News' Mike Emanuel, Tyler Olson and Adam Shaw contributed to this report.

Foreign leaders from the Group of Seven (G-7) failed to agree on a joint declaration because of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's request that they refer to the novel coronavirus as the ""Wuhan virus,"" according to media reports. The dispute between leaders of the industrialized nations -- Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom -- and the United States has caused issues for the group, which was supposed to meet in Pittsburgh for a summit this week, German magazine Der Spiegel reported. The meeting was canceled amid the global pandemic and the group held a video conference instead.

""Make no mistake about it, everyone in that meeting this morning was very focused on making sure that we not only solve the health crisis associated with the Wuhan virus but also the economic challenges that face the globe as we confront it as well,"" he added.

At the press briefing, Pompeo called for transparency in order to combat the virus.

President Trump's 2020 campaign is firing back at former Vice President Joe Biden's team, arguing that the Democratic front-runner wasn't following his own directive about heeding the advice of experts such as Dr. Anthony Fauci, who's leading the administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic. On Tuesday, the former vice president specifically urged people to listen to experts like Fauci. He also released a video earlier this week in which he touted his decision to sound the alarm about the virus earlier in January. But Trump campaign Rapid Response Director Andrew Clark told Fox News that Biden was hypocritical since he himself had opposed a travel ban which Fauci has praised. “Joe Biden failed to follow his own advice and listen to experts like Dr. Fauci,"" Clark said. ""If Biden had been in charge, more Americans would have contracted the virus more quickly. President Trump’s China travel restrictions saved lives, according to health experts, but Biden attacked them as ‘hysterical xenophobia.’ This once again raises serious questions about Joe Biden’s poor judgement and capacity to lead.”  JOE BIDEN SAYS TRUMP NEEDED TO MOVE FASTER ON CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE Clark pointed to how Klain, who served as the ""ebola czar"" under former President Barack Obama, suggested a travel ban was inappropriate during a CNBC appearance on January 28. “I wouldn’t, I think that’s premature,"" he said when asked about a ban. The controversy came as Trump has received criticism from Democrats over his response to the virus. Last week, Biden's campaign released a video in which one of the former vice president's top aides, Ronald Klain, accuses Trump of suppressing experts' warnings about the pandemic and weakening the government's ability to deal with it. The Washington Post called Klain's ad ""false"" for claiming that Trump silenced a top Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) official. Trump has won repeated praise from Fauci, however, for his earlier decision to place restrictions on travel from China and Europe. Fauci also stood alongside Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar, who announced the travel restrictions on China on Jan. 31. On that same day, Biden seemed to describe the ban as ""hysterical xenophobia."" “This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia -- hysterical xenophobia -- and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science,"" he said during a campaign stop. BIDEN TEMPERS ATTACKS ON TRUMP AS CORONAVIRUS BUILDS Biden's campaign did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment. But when the Trump campaign previously called out Biden's xenophobia comment and accused him of incompetence, Biden's spokesman reportedly accused them of projection. ""This is projection, pure and simple -- a classic Trump campaign move. They are trying to attack Vice President Biden on an issue that President Trump has badly mishandled,"" spokesman TJ Ducklo said. ""Weeks ago, Vice President Biden called for President Trump to press China for greater transparency about the origins of the virus, which could have helped limit the spread of the virus and which now would help our scientists and public health professionals combat the epidemic here at home. That hasn't happened.""

As the coronavirus continues to tear through the United States, front-line health-care workers are not only in the line of fire, but they are also caught amid growing concern that medical facilities themselves could become hubs for transmission. What's more, global experts worry that the U.S. will soon take the baton from China and Italy, becoming the epicenter for the disease's spread. ""Health-care workers are living in a state of constant anxiety and fear — fear of exposure from sick patients, of getting sick themselves, of accidentally bringing the virus home to loved ones,"" Dr. Summer McGee, dean of the School of Health Sciences at the University of New Haven, told Fox News. ""Every day is filled with compromises, tradeoffs, and life-and-death decisions on a scale and regularity that our health-care system has never seen.""       A U.S. health care worker wearing a homemade mask for protection while working      (Provided to Fox News) Through her lens, one of the biggest concerns now is that health-care professionals ""know they are working in suboptimal and, in some cases, outright unsafe working conditions."" ""Many hospitals are telling workers that you cannot even use masks or other personal protective equipment (PPE) until they have confirmed that a patient has COVID-19, but tests aren't available for COVID-19. These health-care workers are playing Russian roulette with every patient they treat,"" she stressed. ""Having to ration, reuse, or entirely go without proper protective equipment is a major concern. Many health-care organizations have PPE today but only have a two-week supply."" WHY JAPAN APPEARS TO HAVE AVOIDED A MASS CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK In recent weeks, the novel pathogen – which is believed to have originated in a Chinese wet market late last year – has infected more than 64,500 Americans and killed over 900. As of Wednesday afternoon, more than 12 states have reported more than 1,000 cases, with New York registering over 26,400, followed by neighboring New Jersey at 3,675 and California at almost 2,700.       The newly renamed Hotel 166, located near the Northwestern University Hospital complex, in a Monday photo.      (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast) The United States represents 13.5 percent of the world's confirmed cases and some 4.2 percent of its fatalities – a figure that is climbing by the hour. Subsequently, the supply of vital PPE has seemingly not been able to keep up with the escalating demand, given the fast-acting nature of coronavirus, referred to officially as COVID-19. Lawmakers and leaders also worry that a disproportionate infection rate among providers, rendering them ill and unable to work, will have the spiral effect of deepening the already existing calamity. ""Hospitals are already short-staffed as we are in a severe flu season. Long hours, shortage of protective gear, and testing limitation have some fearing that they are flying blind,"" explained Dr. Azadeh Shirazi, a board-certified surgeon, disease specialist and founder of the California-based La Jolla Laser Surgery Center. ""It's a harrowing scene when you are not protecting a limited supply of trained workers. We cannot afford to lose them."" Beyond just the doctors and nurses in medical facilities, overrun and ill-outfitted hospitals as transmission points also threaten other vital services, including security and cleaning personnel. Moreover, the disease has ravished police and firefighting departments nationwide, and scores of EMTs are also grappling with high numbers of diagnoses among the ranks. Fox News interviewed a number of frontline medical workers across the country, who could only speak on the condition of anonymity because they were under strict mandates not to talk to the press about the developing situation.       New York-Presbyterian says visitors will no longer be allowed inside the labor and delivery units during the coronavirus outbreak.      (Google Maps) One Mississippi-based emergency room physician noted that some staff this week have been put on leave after exhibiting symptoms linked to coronavirus, said that in one incidence, five patients from the same family all went into a critical condition – requiring ventilators – after being in close contact with another at a funeral a week prior to becoming ill. ""The public can help us by not exposing themselves or others and practicing social distancing,"" the doctor stressed. The source depicted the emergency room scene in the state as akin to a ""marathon,"" with the number of those requiring ventilators more than half of the confirmed cases, and staff working extended shifts for more than three weeks straight. Dr. Dan Field, chief medical officer at M.D. Staffers, pointed out that with such demanding hours, many personnel are struggling to obtain safe and adequate child care. ""The best thing everybody can do to help the medical profession as follow the rules set down to flatten the curve by minimizing contact and risk of infection. Only go to the emergency department if you are sicker than a dog and feel like you are heading towards death,"" he said. ""Otherwise, find some way of triaging yourself through telemedicine and similar no-contact communication."" Another New York doctor at a large hospital tending to a number of coronavirus patients early last week lamented that they had fast run out of PPE, and had resorted to reusing n95 masks and even brown paper masks. In another New York hospital, a diagnostic sonographer expressed frustration at a mandate not to wear masks because patients had complained that it gave them anxiety, igniting an extra layer of stress for the workers and their families. Furthermore, many experts fear that – given China's initial smothering of information related to the virus and the incorrect information about its transmission stemming from the World Health Organization (WHO) in the first few critical weeks of the outbreak – the deadly pathogen was swarming unchecked through hospitals and doctor's offices for weeks. While at least 15 states have issued stay-at-home orders and shuttered nonessential businesses, local governments in many other pockets of the country are now being forced to adopt similarly stringent measures including closing public places and restaurants, as well as prohibiting medical procedures and surgeries considered not to be immediately required to ensure as much space and resources in left amid the coronavirus battle. ""We just lost a young nurse in Saint Louis to the Wuhan virus,"" lamented Dr. Scott Magill, executive director of Veterans in Defense of Liberty and former U.S. Army Medical Corps soldier. ""Watching these medical warriors, doctors, nurses and hospital staff, placing themselves and their families in grave danger for the sake of humanity, is emotionally powerful."" And Dr. Josh Luke, a Los Angeles-based hospital CEO – most recently Memorial Hospital of Gardena in Los Angeles County – opined that L.A. county officials and Orange County officials in California have been refusing his help, and has essentially been told, ""We are not set up to bring on individuals. We are relying on the health systems to help with pop-up hospitals and overflow isolation hotels."" As a former hospital CEO and licensed nursing home administrator with significant experience managing ventilator units, Luke noted, the red tape is a restriction at a time of desperate need. He pointed out that doctors are being asked to come out of retirement to help, but the process of streamlining management is ""clearly flawed."" After being turned away by L.A. county officials, Luke said he drove this week to a hotel in Pomona that's being converted to accommodate isolation overflow and was turned away by security. WILL' HERD IMMUNITY' WORK AGAINST CORONAVIRUS? Nonetheless, national data with regards to just how hard health-care personnel have been hit by coronavirus is not yet available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Dr. Attila Hertelendy, a Florida-based expert in biomedicine and emergency and disaster management, also underscored that the usual burden already placed on the medical infrastructure has not suddenly dispersed due to the coronavirus onslaught, either. ""Most of the current challenges in our health-care facilities stem from managing the day to day patients that come to our facilities, these patients that have chronic conditions requiring daily treatment such as dialysis, chemotherapy, etc. They don't go away just because there is a coronavirus pandemic,"" he said. ""Finding ways to continue to provide high-quality care for vulnerable patient groups such as the disabled, elderly remains a challenge as resources are diverted to manage an escalating number of cases daily."" Despite broad criticism over a lack of preparedness for such a public health crisis, a late 2019 assessment by the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) and the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security (JHCHS) ranked the United States as the best-prepared country in the world to handle a pandemic. President Trump this week acknowledged that the pandemic is likely to worsen but has assured workers that federal authorities are addressing concerns surrounding specialized masks and surgical gowns, with shipments on their way. On Wednesday, Trump affirmed that FEMA was distributing 8 million medical masks and 14 million surgical masks.

The unrest swirls amid veiled threats from the Communist leadership that supplies would be withheld should they be saddled with coronavirus blame. Moreover, the sudden onslaught of the coronavirus has also illuminated the ingenuity and selflessness of the many American individuals and private companies. According to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, more than 40,000 health-care professionals have signed on as volunteers to offer assistance in New York alone – some 6,000 of them in the realm of mental health care to provide free online services to those in need.       A large tent set up in front of the emergency room at EvergreenHealth Medical Center in Kirkland, Wash., last week.      (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren) Other non-traditional businesses – from car and electronic manufacturers to small apparel companies – have also taken to making such crucial medical supplies, including respirators, ventilators, masks, and gowns. Companies developing at-home testing kits have over the past week even reversed course and opted to send their technologies instead to medical facilities as the first priority.

""Once our ventilator and ICU capacity has run out, doctors and administrators must be prepared for how they will make rationing decisions, on the ground and in real-time, of who will get lifesaving care and who will not,"" McGee added.

"                          Joe Biden addresses the future of presidential debates amid the coronavirus pandemic. A piece published in The Atlantic made the argument this week that the ""idea"" of former Vice President Joe Biden is enough to defeat President Trump in November and that in order to do so, Biden would simply have to ""stay alive."" ""Democrats need little from the front-runner beyond his corporeal presence,"" Atlantic contributing writer Alex Wagner wrote on Tuesday in a piece titled ""Stay Alive, Joe Biden."" Wagner suggested that Democratic voters are so eager to oust Trump that Biden's ongoing campaign has less weight than his decades-old familiarity. ""Voters seem to have coalesced around Biden for his past -- who they have known him to be for the past four decades in American politics -- rather than for anything in his present. It’s as if Biden exists primarily as an idea, rather than an actual candidate,"" Wagner wrote. ""Democrats have chosen Biden as their vessel for Trump’s defeat, and that choice is the entire point: The vanquishing matters more than anything else."" She went on to make the case that the coronavirus effect on the 2020 election shouldn't weaken Biden's campaign as long as his team keeps the former vice president ""alive in the American imagination."" CNN'S JAKE TAPPER TEACHES BIDEN HOW TO COUGH PROPERLY IN AWKWARD INTERVIEW MOMENT ""Biden’s team appears to understand this, and to believe that what matters most now is keeping their candidate alive in the American imagination as an alternative to Trump,"" Wagner explained. ""His appearances these days have an almost parallel-universe quality to them: Biden’s audience-less remarks from his home in Delaware have the suggestion of an Oval Office address, and their content seems intended to offer a glimpse into the twilight zone where someone else, someone more empathetic and capable, is president. It’s as if Biden is telegraphing to his public: You have already imagined that I can beat Trump; now imagine what it will be like when I am president."" She continued: ""For the foreseeable future, there will be no more speeches in front of hundreds, or lines of people waiting to shake Biden’s hand. There may not even be the glossy fanfare of a convention with a primetime address. But, truthfully, all those things were always sort of beside the point... Biden was never really convincing anyone on the stump -- his political power at this point is an idea, held collectively, about how to defeat Trump. The work now is to keep that idea convincing enough, for long enough, among as many people as possible, for the corporeal man to actually win.""

As coronavirus cases start to overwhelm U.S. hospitals, American companies say they're starting to make face masks and other personal protective equipment critically needed by medical staff. In Minnesota, the MyPillow company is refocusing 75 percent of its production to face masks for health care workers. ""We have capacity to make a lot of things at big rates and we’re going to be going hopefully from 10,000 units a day to 50,000 units a day in a very short period of time,"" CEO Mike Lindell told FOX 9 of Minneapolis-St. Paul. Coronavirus relief: Fashion brands pledge to produce face masks for medical supply The masks will go to hospitals in Minnesota and other states, he said. MyPillow worked with the Trump administration to get the proper design, Lindell told FOX 9. In New Jersey, Stuart Carlitz, president and CEO of mattress company Eclipse International, said he made the decision to switch production to masks last week after hearing New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo say that state had a shortage and was paying high prices for masks. “My first thought was that’s really terrible that people would take advantage of this time to profit,” he said, according to NJ.com. He said he realized one of the materials used in face masks is also used in his mattresses. He ordered the other materials and is ready to start production. The company is making an initial batch of 38,000 masks, which will be donated to a hospital in New Brunswick, N.J., where the factory is located. “I’m not trying to sell masks,” Carlitz said. “Whether it’s a dollar apiece or four dollars apiece, that’s not going to change my business. I’m going to donate the masks.” “I’m not trying to sell masks. Whether it’s a dollar apiece or four dollars apiece, that’s not going to change my business. I’m going to donate the masks.” The Tablecloth Company in Paterson, N.J., decided to start making masks after requests from customers, including nursing homes where the virus can easily spread, according to NJ.com. Los Angeles-based apron company Hedley &Bennett will also be putting its 30 factory employees to work on face masks. Owner Ellen Bennett said she was inspired after hearing fashion designer Christian Siriano had directed his seamstresses to start manufacturing them.  “I’ve always been a wake-up-and-fight kind of a girl. And I thought, ‘This is game time,’” Bennett said, according to Fast Company magazine.

"                          Republican Kentucky senator Rand Paul tests positive for COVID-19 and will remain in quarantine, according to his official Twitter account. For millions around the globe waking up Wednesday, the big news was that Prince Charles has the coronavirus. His symptoms are said to be mild, and the prince is believed to have gotten the virus from his high number of public engagements, during which he would try to stop himself and remember not to shake hands. But for me, the news is that an old colleague, David Von Drehle, has mild to moderate symptoms, battling “waves of fever, I was drifting half in and half out of sleep. I was wearing a down jacket with the hood cinched around my head. I was buried under the covers, teeth chattering.” He’s “thankful” that it’s not worse. And that another old colleague, Anne Kornblut, is fighting the disease, “telling my kids to back away from me, while informing them that this scary thing upending the entire planet is now inside our house. Inside their mom. My daughter cried and asked if I will get better. I couldn’t hug her.” It’s not that these people are more deserving of sympathy because they’re journalists. Doctors, nurses, hospital staffers, police officers, even retail clerks are the ones on the front lines, their stories mostly untold. Journalists have a platform, of course, but they and their families are coping just like everyone else. The thing about this virus is that it doesn’t care if you are a working stiff, a prince, or a movie star. The difference for me is that I know some of these people, and that wipes away the abstractions. It’s how so many of us felt when Tom Hanks and his wife got the virus in Australia (though I’ve only met the actor once, for a brief interview). When Andrew Cuomo tells the administration that he needs 26,000 more ventilators or that many people will die, it’s hard to wrap your head around such a figure. When people at your own news organization get the virus --as have six Fox News staffers in New York, now under self-quarantine --it hits home. Von Drehle, with whom I shared a small New York office many years ago and later sat nearby in a Washington newsroom, now lives in Kansas City. CURE WORSE THAN DISEASE?

I earn my living by solitary work from my own home, and I adopted every recommended hygiene and distancing technique weeks before the president took the pandemic seriously. Bottom line: I don’t know where I picked it up. It’s everywhere.” Dave says he hears people on TV all day talking about testing, but there was no testing in his area. A kind ER doctor listened to his lungs in a hospital parking lot, said he probably has the virus and told him to come back if he got worse. “It’s going to be a race now to see whether I can finish this column before I pass out,” Von Drehle writes. Kornblut, a longtime Washington Post reporter and editor, is now a Facebook executive living in California. After a trip to New York, she says on her page, “I had to get in bed and go to sleep. It hit me like a truck.” Her son wrote up the development for their home newspaper: “Anne Kornblut has the coronavirus but do not worry it is not the bad kind. Please note that you should not be within ten feet of Anne.” Kornblut says the health department “called to inform me to stay away from everyone, including my children. So who should take care of them if my husband tests positive, too? ‘We haven’t had that scenario yet,’ the public health nurse said.” Her husband has since tested positive for the virus. I was even harder hit by news yesterday that Alan Finder, a retired New York Times editor and reporter and onetime City Hall bureau chief, has died from the virus. He was extremely gracious to me when I was a rookie reporter decades ago at New Jersey’s Bergen Record. Smart, savvy and a terrific writer, he was always generous and someone I looked up to. Times reporter Kevin Sack tweeted that Finder was “a terrific reporter, a calming presence and, as anyone who knew him will attest, one of the menschiest guys around. RIP.” I also know people in the world of politics who have been affected. Amy Klobuchar revealed that her husband, John Bessler, has the virus, and was hospitalized in Virginia after registering “very low oxygen levels.” The senator and former presidential candidate told MSNBC that “you can't go and visit your loved one. I would love to be at my husband's side right now.” I’ve interviewed another former presidential candidate, Rand Paul, numerous times. He has come under sharp criticism from some fellow lawmakers because he continued to work for six days, including a visit to the Senate gym, after being tested for the virus, though he self-quarantined as soon as he got a positive result. SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES In a column for USA Today, Paul said he sought a test, even though that was not recommended by health officials, because he’d been traveling extensively and had part of his lung removed seven months ago: “For those who want to criticize me for lack of quarantine, realize that if the rules on testing had been followed to a T, I would never have been tested and would still be walking around the halls of the Capitol.” There are, as I mentioned, so many individual stories among the 60,000 confirmed virus cases in America. The Washington Post, to its credit, spotlighted some of them: The Rev. Jadon Hartsuff, an Episcopal priest in D.C., who first felt drained after a Sunday service. Mike Saag, an infectious disease doctor in Alabama, who developed a cough and was bone-tired. Ritchie Torres, a New York City councilman from the Bronx, whose ordeal began with a general sickly feeling. “It is psychologically unsettling to know I am carrying a virus that could harm my loved ones,” he says. Indeed, this entire crisis has been psychologically unsettling. It’s that way for journalists looking at the struggles of other journalists, health workers looking at the struggles of other health workers, or all of us, as Americans, looking at the suffering in our country. Even if those bearing the brunt aren’t royalty.

Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s nearly 500-page report was also sharply critical at times of the FBI’s handling of the case, including failing to share information. Earlier this month, Boasberg largely approved revisions that the FBI said it would make to its process for seeking wiretaps – in reaction to Horowitz's report. Among the problems, Boasberg noted, were that the FBI had ""omitted or mischaracterized"" various ""information bearing on [former British spy Christopher] Steele's personal credibility and professional judgment.""

"                          Texas issues disaster declaration; Gov. Greg Abbott speaks out. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA), along with other pro-choice groups, filed a lawsuit Wednesday against Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, Attorney General Ken Paxton and several other state officials over a temporary ban on elective abortion during the coronavirus pandemic. The ban was issued as part of an executive order by Abbott aimed at conserving medical equipment and the capacity of the health care system after warnings from health care professionals that patients sick with the coronavirus might overwhelm hospital capacity and deplete supplies, such as personal protective equipment for doctors and nurses. Pro-choice activists say the ban was issued in bad faith and limits access to an ""essential"" procedure. ""Gov. Abbott and anti-abortion activists nationwide are forcing a legal and political fight in the middle of a public health crisis,"" PPFA acting president and CEO Alexis McGill-Johnson said. ""Elected leaders are expending valuable time and resources exploiting a global pandemic to score political points instead of rallying to respond to this crisis."" CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW FISA COURT DELAYS DEADLINE FOR DOJ'S PROPOSED REFORMS AMID CORONAVIRUS Nancy Northrop, the president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement that even a temporary ban on abortion would harm women in Texas. ""Abortion care is time-sensitive and essential health care that has a profound impact on a person’s health and life, which is why it is protected as a constitutional right. Texas is abusing the state’s emergency powers and we are filing suit today to stop it,"" she said. Paxton, however, countered that it is abortion providers who are acting in bad faith and putting the lives of Texans at risk. CORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN ""It is unconscionable that abortion providers are fighting against the health of Texans and withholding desperately needed supplies and personal protective equipment in favor of a procedure that they refer to as a ‘choice,'"" he tweeted Wednesday night. ""My office will tirelessly defend Governor Abbott’s Order to ensure that necessary supplies reach the medical professionals combating this national health crisis."" Paxton's interpretation of the governor's order would only allow abortions ""medically necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother."" A group of pro-life leaders had sent a letter to the federal Department of Health and Human Services on Tuesday, opposing the promotion of abortion during the coronavirus pandemic. It also called on ""all public health officials"" to oppose efforts to allow abortion providers to use protective gear or receive coronavirus response funds, among other things. ""While surgery centers postpone elective and diagnostic procedures, abortion centers are churning out surgical and chemical abortions and putting women, especially the poor, at risk,"" the letter reads. ""Their continued operation depletes sorely needed personal protective equipment and leads to complications that will further overwhelm already overextended emergency rooms. The abortion industry is compounding one crisis with another. Therefore, we urge public officials to use their broad emergency authority to safeguard against the extreme abortion agenda."" BIDEN'S CLAIM HE 'BECAME A PROFESSOR' AFTER LEAVING SENATE SPARKS CONFUSION The Planned Parenthood suit argues that Abbott's order, and Paxton's interpretation of it, violate patients' right to ""substantive due process"" under the 14th Amendment, a legal catch-all involving states' authority to regulate peoples' actions, particularly those – like abortion – that the Supreme Court has said are constitutionally protected. It also says the order violates abortion providers' 14th Amendment's equal protection clause by ""singling abortion providers and their patients out for differential treatment from providers of other medical services and their patients."" The suit also points out that the surgical abortions do not require much PPE and abortion by medication – which Paxton has included in his interpretation of the ban – requires none. Because of that, the suit argues, the Texas order is aimed more at stopping abortion than at conserving resources. ""If the Executive Order is enforced, as interpreted by the Attorney General (contrary to its plain language), to apply to both procedural abortion and medication abortion, it effectively bans abortion in Texas for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency,"" the suit says. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But it also argues that surgical abortion should be allowed because medication abortion is not effective ""after ten weeks of pregnancy."" The suit asks the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas for a restraining order and injunctions to allow Texas abortion providers to immediately continue performing abortions. It also asks that the court eventually rule that Abbott's executive order and Paxton's interpretation of it are unconstitutional. President Trump granted Texas' request for a major disaster declaration on Wednesday, opening the door for extra federal funding to fight the coronavirus in the state.

"                          Congressman Doug Collins discusses what made it into the $ 2 trillion stimulus bill to respond to the coronavirus pandemic Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. The massive $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package President Trump is waiting to sign into law upon likely passage by the House of Representatives includes $400 million to help states move toward mail-in voting, amid a pandemic that is forcing many Americans to shelter at home. The funds would assist states as they expand voting by mail, early voting, online registration and make in-person voting safer for all. SENATE PASSES CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS BILL; ACTION MOVES TO HOUSE Lawmakers and election advocates are warning that if states don’t receive federal assistance to move away from in-person voting, there could be low turnout and disruptions in November’s general election. The coronavirus outbreak has upended the presidential nominating calendar, with many states postponing their remaining contests.  Mail-in voting was already the default option for three states that are scheduled to hold primaries on April 4: Alaska, Hawaii and Wyoming. Now all three states are moving to 100 percent vote-by-mail and are extending the deadlines for ballots to be delivered.  Among the states that have postponed their primaries until June, Georgia and Ohio are spending millions to send absentee ballots to voters. Currently three states – Colorado, Oregon and Washington – vote only by mail. More than a dozen other states allow mail-in-voting as an option. The $400 million in election funding in the bill passed by the Senate is up from $140 million proposed in the original bill assembled by Senate Republicans. Some Senate Democrats had pushed for $2 billion in funding. That was the price tag suggested last week by the non-partisan Brennan Center for Justice to help states make voting safe from the threat of coronavirus. The Brennan Center warned on Twitter that the funding in the Senate bill is “far less than election officials need to hold a safe, fair, accurate election in Nov. Congress needs to make up the difference ASAP.” Some Republican lawmakers oppose coronavirus stimulus funding to beef up voting by mail, arguing that it has nothing to do with helping workers, small businesses and large companies devastated by the shutdown of much of the economy due to the pandemic. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION Among the critics was GOP Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, who tweeted earlier this week that early voting and other elements pushed by Democrats do “nothing” to help workers and small businesses “survive the coronavirus crisis.”    ",         Coronavirus package has $400 million to help states beef up mail-in voting,         2020-03-26T101115-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/400-million-in-coronavirus-package-to-help-states-beef-up-mail-in-voting,Fox

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. The Pentagon said Thursday cases of the novel coronavirus have quadrupled in the U.S. military since last week, with more than 280 service members now infected around the world. Fox News has learned that as of Thursday, 280 members of the military, 62 contractors, 134 Defense Department civilians and 98 military dependents had tested positive for COVID-19. CORONAVIRUS WILL WORSEN OVER NEXT MONTH IF RESTRICTIONS ARE EASED According to the latest numbers, 24 American troops have recovered and 15 remain in the hospital fighting complications of the virus. The new numbers come after the Pentagon reported last Friday that 67 service members had tested positive. Also on Thursday, acting Secretary of the U.S. Navy Thomas Modly announced that all 5,000 sailors aboard aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt will be tested for COVID-19, after eight sailors aboard the ship tested positive in recent days. Those who tested positive were flown off the ship earlier this week and are only showing “mild symptoms,” according to Modly. Modly said 104 Navy sailors and 31 U.S. Marines have tested positive around the world. ""We are trending higher,"" Modly said, regarding the Navy accounting for roughly one-third of all U.S. military positive cases. Top Pentagon officials have warned that the pandemic is showing no signs of letting up, with Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Army Gen. Mark Milley estimating that the outbreak will last in the U.S. for at least the next “three months.” Later, President Trump suggested reopening parts of the U.S. economy by Easter, which falls on April 12 this year, and argued he doesn’t want “to turn the country off” and see a continued economic downfall from the pandemic. But on Wednesday, Air Force Brig. Gen. Dr. Paul Friedrichs, a top Pentagon doctor, said that the potential easing of restrictions by a predetermined date could potentially “make this worse.” ""We're going to continue to see this – no surprise – continue to grow,"" Friedrichs told reporters. TOP PENTAGON OFFICIALS ESTIMATE COVID-19 OUTBREAK WILL LAST 3 MONTHS When asked by Fox News’ Jennifer Griffin if it was wise to ease restrictions by Easter, Friedrichs said he did not think there was a “great deal of value in speculating a particular date.” “What I would ask for everyone’s help with is worry about today,” he said. “Because if we stop doing the right thing today because we think something’s going to happen in four weeks, we will make this worse.” He added: ""I don't think it matters what day things start to get better. What matters is what we're doing right now to mitigate this outbreak. I'm not sure how to say it any more clearly than that.” As of Thursday morning, the U.S. reported more than 69,100 positive cases of COVID-19. Late Wednesday night, the death toll in the country exceeded 1,000.

The Department of Health and Human Services on Thursday implemented President Trump’s executive order to prevent the hoarding of certain health and medical resources necessary to respond to the coronavirus outbreak. HHS Secretary Alex Azar on Thursday announced a list of certain health and medical resources subject to the hoarding prevention measures, which also target price-gouging. BARR SAYS DOJ WILL GO AFTER CORONAVIRUS PRICE GOUGERS, HOARDERS “Today, we designated a set of medical products that will be subject to the president’s recent executive order to prevent hoarding and price-gouging,” Azar said. The order prevents accumulation in excess of reasonable demands of business, personal or home consumption, or for the purpose of resale prices in excess of current market prices. The designated materials include N-95 filtering face masks, other “filtering face piece respirators;” air purifying respirators and filters and cartridges. The order also protects chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (the malaria drugs that are being used to help the symptoms of COVID-19); sterilization services for medical devices; and disinfecting and hand sanitizing products. Personal protective equipment (PPE) including medical gowns, apparel, surgical gowns, Tyvek suits, PPE face masks, surgical masks and face shields are also protected under the order. The order also covers portable ventilators, regular ventilators, anesthesia gas machines, and other breathing devices. “HHS and FEMA will continue working closely together to monitor and address shortages of necessary medical products, and we look forward to working closely with the Department of Justice on hoarding prevention measures,” Azar said Thursday. “The president will take every possible step to get American health care providers the supplies they need to stay safe and save lives.” Earlier this week, the Trump administration vowed to go after price gougers and those hoarding critical medical supplies amid the COVID-19 pandemic. “Very simply, we will not allow anyone to exploit the suffering of American citizens for their own profit,” Trump said Monday. QUESTIONS ABOUT CORONAVIRUS? ASK AN EXPERT Attorney General Bill Barr said Monday that he has seen evidence of price gouging and hoarding in recent weeks. “Once specific materials are so designated, persons are prohibited from accumulating those items in excess of reasonable personal or business needs or for the purpose of selling them in excess of prevailing market prices,” Barr said Monday. ""We’re talking about people hoarding these goods and materials on an industrial scale for the purposes of manipulating the market and ultimately driving windfall profits,"" Barr said. ""If you have a big supply of toilet paper in your house, this is not something you have to worry about. But, if you are sitting on a warehouse with masks, surgical masks, you will be hearing a knock on your door.” The order comes after states, like New York, which has become the epicenter of the country’s COVID-19 outbreak, complained about price-gouging on necessary PPE like N-95 masks. As of Thursday morning, the U.S. reported more than 69,100 positive cases of COVID-19. Late Wednesday night, the death toll in the country exceeded 1,000.

The final version of the Senate’s coronavirus stimulus package left out billions of dollars that had been planned for the Department of Energy to go toward replenishing the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve. An earlier draft of the legislation included $3 billion in appropriations for the Energy Department’s SPR Petroleum Account meant “for necessary expenses related to the acquisition, transportation, and injection of domestic petroleum products.” After Democrats resisted, claiming it was an expensive bailout for the oil industry, it was removed from the final version.

WTI Crude is currently at just over $23 a barrel, down from a high of $63.27 in January.

Department of Energy spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes said in a statement to Fox News that buying oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a low price ""is a common sense move benefiting taxpayers and supporting our nation’s economic and national security interest,"" while the American energy sector suffers during the coronavirus outbreak.

Pam Pilkinton Anderson and Pat Pilkinton Norris, who perform together as the Chillbillie Twins, are becoming a bit of a viral sensation after writing and recording “Corona Virus Blues,” a song in which they lament not being able to find toilet paper, hand sanitizer and Clorox wipes, among other things. It doesn’t hurt that the song is also super catchy — again, in a good way. HOW TO AVOID GOING STIR CRAZY DURING SELF-ISOLATION “We’re just twin sisters that play music together around the house,” Anderson told Fox News. “We grabbed some old costumes and made a video and put it on Facebook hoping our friends would like it.”       They wanted to “help spread a little joy during this devastating time,"" the sisters tell Fox News.      (Pam Pilkinton Anderson and Pat Pilkinton Norris) Anderson said she and Norris were inspired to write ""Corona Virus Blues"" (aka ""Flatten That Curve"") as a way to “help spread a little joy during this devastating time.” That’s also likely why she and her sister — from Bossier City and Shreveport, respectively —decided to incorporate some lyrics about staying positive and supporting the community.

Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot is warning residents not to go on long runs or bike rides in the city’s latest effort to crack down over the spread of coronavirus, even cautioning that residents could be arrested should they break the rules. Lightfoot, during remarks Wednesday, reportedly urged residents to “stay at home” and “only go out for essentials” —rules put in place by Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker last week. NEW JERSEY 'STAY AT HOME ORDER' ISSUED TO HALT CORONAVIRUS SPREAD But Lightfoot took the order a step further. “Be smart,” Lightfoot said Wednesday, according to  CBS Chicago. “Not only will our police be deployed to shut them down if you are not abiding by these orders, we will be forced to shut down the parks and lakefront.” Lightfoot went on to announce that spending long periods of time outside or in playgrounds is not allowed. “You cannot go on long bike rides. Playgrounds are shut down,” she said. “You must abide by the order. Outside is for a brief respite, not for 5Ks.” She added: “I can’t emphasize enough that we abide [by] the rules.” The parks in Chicago are still open, according to the city, but officials warned residents to keep their distance from others. ""This is an order that’s enforceable by law,"" she reportedly said. ""We’re going to give you an admonition. And if you don’t turn right away and head home then you’re going to get a citation. And if worse, yeah, we will take you into custody."" She added: ""I hope that it doesn’t come to that, I hope that I don’t have to shut down the lake front, shut down all the parks, but I will."" The Chicago police doubled down on the warning that violations are punishable by a fine of $500 and potentially arrest. LOCKDOWNS, STAY AT HOME POLICIES MULTIPLY AS CORONAVIRUS CASES, DEATHS IN THE US MOUNT An accompanying press release, though, did not appear to place restrictions on the extent of outdoor exercise that Chicagoans are able to do, aside from telling people to keep their distance from others. The press release from the mayor's office said: ""Chicagoans are still able, and encouraged, to do the following during this time: Go for a walk or run but maintain physical distance from others while doing so; walk their dog, but not congregate at the dog park or beach; visit one of the City's public parks and outdoor recreation areas that remain open for use during regular operating hours but avoid clustering in groups."" The statement also said Chicagoans are able, like in other states and localities, to ""shop at the grocery stores that remain open, as long as you are not sick, and practice social distancing"" and ""continue visiting the restaurants that remain open for pick-up and delivery."" Chicago’s measures come as a number of states across the nation issued similar “stay at home” orders. Pritzker, last Friday, announced Illinois’ own version of a ""shelter-in-place"" order, which began over the weekend and is expected to continue at least through April 7. Pritzker’s order came after California Gov. Gavin Newsom, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont issued similar orders, which closed non-essential businesses and urged residents to work from home unless they are an essential worker. In New York, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S., Gov. Andrew Cuomo made exceptions for media, health care providers and financial institutions, among others, were made as well, with workers falling into the category of ""essential workers."" The statewide orders urge people to practice social distancing and only leave their homes for necessities such as groceries, picking up medications and seeking medical attention. And in New Jersey, Murphy banned birthday parties and funerals. COVID-19 was designated a pandemic by the World Health Organization earlier this month. As of Thursday morning, the U.S. reported more than 69,100 positive cases of COVID-19. Late Wednesday night, the death toll in the country exceeded 1,000.

One of the provisions tucked into the massive coronavirus relief bill approved by the Senate late Wednesday night restricts certain businesses that accept government loans in their dealings with labor unions. Businesses with between 500 and 10,000 employees that accept loans to tide them over until the pandemic abates will not be allowed to get rid of any collective bargaining agreement that they already have and will be barred from taking sides on any efforts by their employees to unionize. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., praised the Senate bill Wednesday night after lambasting an earlier version of the legislation. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW SENATE OKs $2T CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS PACKAGE IN UNANIMOUS VITE; HOUSE SETS FRIDAY VOTE ""This bipartisan legislation takes us a long way down the road in meeting the needs of the American people,"" she said. ""While the compromise does not go as far as our Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act, thanks to the unity and insistence of Senate and House Democrats, the bill has moved a great deal closer to America’s workers."" The union protections were not in an earlier version of the Senate bill released over the weekend which failed on two separate procedural votes. The requirement that mid-size businesses not ""abrogate existing collective bargaining agreements"" lasts until two years after the business has repaid its loan from the government and the requirement that they ""remain neutral in any organizing effort"" lasts until the loan is paid off. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The union-boosting passages lie on pages 523 and 524 of the 880-page, $2 trillion package aimed at beating back the coronavirus pandemic and limiting the economic fallout caused by it. The mandates are tucked in between a variety of other requirements meant to hold companies that take government money accountable. Those include requirements that the businesses keep on at least 90 percent of their workers, are not currently in bankruptcy, have more than 50 percent of their employees in the U.S., will not outsource jobs for at least two years after their loans are repaid, won't engage in stock buybacks and more. The House of Representatives is set to vote on the Senate bill on Friday. It is not expected to make any changes to the legislation as it rushes the massive relief package to President Trump's desk.

A provision in the $2 trillion coronavirus response package that Republican senators had warned could fuel layoffs looks likely to remain in the text -- after an 11th-hour effort to remove it in the Senate was shot down. Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, both of South Carolina, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, and Rick Scott of Florida flagged what they described as a “massive drafting error” that could have “devastating consequences.” SENATE OKS $2T CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS PACKAGE IN UNANIMOUS VOTE; HOUSE SETS FRIDAY VOTE The concern is that the current version could pay workers more in unemployment benefits than they're currently making, by adding a $600 per week payment on top of ordinary benefits that are calculated as a percentage of income. This could disrupt the labor market further, the lawmakers warned. “Unless this bill is fixed, there is a strong incentive for employees to be laid off instead of going to work. This isn’t an abstract, philosophical point -- it’s an immediate, real-world problem,” Tim Scott, Sasse and Graham said in a statement. In a press conference, Tim Scott gave the example of someone in South Carolina making $20 an hour, or $800 a week, who could get up to $326 of unemployment benefits in the state, followed by another $600 a week in the federal benefit, meaning they would be earning more than their normal salary. Critics of their stance noted that the unemployment boost would currently expire in the summer, plus one cannot leave a job voluntarily and then claim unemployment. Others suggested it could be solved by employers raising wages. But the senators warned that introducing such powerful incentives into the economy at such a crucial time could kneecap the economy even further. ""You want to destroy what's left of the economy? Pass it the way it’s written,"" Graham said. ""If you want to help people, pay them their wages, but don’t pay them more not to work."" It was a stance supported by conservative groups such as the Heritage Foundation. ""As currently drafted, the CARES Act will cripple the economy by pushing people away from their employers and onto unemployment insurance,""  said Paul Winfree, director of Heritage's Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies. ""This will ultimately hurt workers who will be better off remaining attached to their jobs so that when the pandemic subsides we can all get back to work as quickly as possible."" Sasse introduced an amendment Wednesday that would cap unemployment benefits at 100 percent of someone’s salary. It needed 60 votes in the upper chamber but only mustered 48 votes in the face of opposition mainly from Democrats but also including some Republicans. That opposition was encapsulated by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who even threatened to put a hold on the bill over the issue “until stronger conditions are imposed on the $500 billion corporate welfare fund to make sure that any corporation receiving financial assistance under this legislation does not lay off workers, cut wages or benefits, ship jobs overseas, or pay workers poverty wages.” The Republicans still voted for the bill -- given the urgency of the economic situation at large -- but kept their objections to that part of the bill. READ THE FINAL BILL; READ A SUMMARY OF THE BILL ; READ THE SASSE AMENDMENT “The bottom line is that the good in the bill outweighed the bad, and especially this provision that I thought was bad,” Sen. Tim Scott said on Fox & Friends. Their concerns have been echoed by Republicans in the Democrat-controlled House, where making changes that would limit unemployment faces an even bigger hurdle than the effort in the Senate. “Yes that’s a problem,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters late Wednesday when asked about the item. “This is not a moment in time, when all of America is trying to come together, that someone should benefit and get a higher payment than they're actually earning while they’re working by taking money from a taxpayer to pay you.” “I don’t think any American would actually want that, so why wouldn't we just correct that bill so that wouldn’t happen?” he said. But, with most lawmakers agreeing that time is of the essence, and leaders trying to keep all of their caucuses in check and on board for the enormous package, it seems likely that Republicans won’t mount a longshot effort to fix it, considering that it would likely be dead on arrival on a House vote. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Currently, the House plans to vote on the bill Friday in a voice vote, in part as a safety precaution -- which would make a protracted fight over legislation unlikely. “In order to protect the safety of Members and staff and prevent further spread of COVID-19 through Members’ travel, the Republican Leader and I expect that the House vote on final passage will be done by voice vote. Members who want to come to the House Floor to debate this bill will be able to do so,” Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said in a letter to colleagues, adding that there would be a chance for debate if needed.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. The Senate on Wednesday passed an unprecedented $2 trillion stimulus package to provide health care and economic aid amid the coronavirus outbreak and national shutdown of American daily life. It now has to pass the House before going to the president's desk for his signature. Here's a look at some of the highlights included in the sprawling, 500 page-plus measure. Checks and Unemployment The package provides direct financial help to Americans in the form of stimulus checks sent out to many Americans. The proposal would include a one-time payment of $1,200 per adult, $2,400 per couple in the U.S. and $500 a child. The stimulus checks would phase out for individuals making more than $75,000 and would no longer qualify for those making more than $99,000. Those thresholds double for couples. Democrats said the package specifically would help replace the salaries of furloughed workers for four months, rather than the three months first proposed. Furloughed workers would get whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment, plus a $600 per week add-on, with gig workers like Uber drivers covered for the first time. SENATE DEMS PROPOSE ADDITIONAL $200 IN MONTHLY SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS, AMID CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK Small Business Support         The massive economic relief package would provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. In addition, $562 million is also being put aside to help small businesses by ensuring SBA has the resources to provide Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) to businesses that need financial support. These loans will be available during an emergency period that ends June 30 and will be forgiven if the employer continues to pay workers for the duration of the public health and financial crisis. Funding for Public Health A large chunk of the bill focuses on public health, including $100 billion for a new program to provide direct aid to health care institutions on the front line of the coronavirus pandemic and $16 billion being allocated to replenish the Strategic National Stockpile supplies of pharmaceuticals, personal protective equipment, and other medical supplies, which are distributed to state and local health agencies, hospitals and other healthcare entities facing shortages during emergencies. Another $4.3 billion will go to federal, state, and local public health agencies to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the coronavirus, including for the purchase of personal protective equipment; laboratory testing to detect positive cases; infection control and mitigation at the local level to prevent the spread of the virus; and other public health preparedness and response activities. An additional $1 billion will be put into the Defense Production Act to bolster domestic supply chains, enabling the industry to quickly ramp up production of personal protective equipment, ventilators, and other urgently needed medical supplies, and billions dollars more for federal, state, and local health agencies to purchase such equipment. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Big Company Loans One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines, given that Democrats wanted them to abide by new carbon emissions restrictions. It includes $10 billion in grants to help the country's airports as the aviation sector grapples with the steepest and potentially sustained decline in air travel in history. For airlines in particular, the bill includes $46 billion in total for the industry, with $25 billion going to passenger airlines, $4 billion for cargo companies, and $17 billion for companies deemed important to national security. Republicans also won the inclusion of an ""employee retention"" tax credit that's estimated to provide $50 billion to companies that retain employees on payroll and cover 50 percent of workers' paychecks. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2 percent Social Security payroll tax. With memories of the 2008 financial crisis still on the minds of many lawmakers, the bill will also the immediate disclosure of the recipients of any loans and stronger oversight. This includes installing an inspector general and congressionally appointed board to monitor and making sure companies can't use the loans for stock buybacks. A  final facet of the bill ensures that companies owned by President Trump's family can't receive any loans from the fund.

The Pentagon said Thursday cases of the novel coronavirus have quadrupled in the U.S. military since last week, with more than 280 service members now infected around the world. Fox News has learned that as of Thursday, 280 members of the military, 62 contractors, 134 Defense Department civilians and 98 military dependents had tested positive for COVID-19. CORONAVIRUS WILL WORSEN OVER NEXT MONTH IF RESTRICTIONS ARE EASED According to the latest numbers, 24 American troops have recovered and 15 remain in the hospital fighting complications of the virus. The new numbers come after the Pentagon reported last Friday that 67 service members had tested positive. Also on Thursday, acting Secretary of the U.S. Navy Thomas Modly announced that all 5,000 sailors aboard aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt will be tested for COVID-19, after eight sailors aboard the ship initially tested positive. Those who tested positive were flown off the ship earlier this week and are only showing “mild symptoms,” according to Modly. A senior U.S. Navy official told Fox News Thursday that there are now 23 sailors onboard the Roosevelt who tested positive for COVID-19. The Roosevelt is now in a port in Guam, the official said. All sailors will remain onboard the ship and all 5,000 sailors are slated to be tested; however, Roosevelt only has 800 testing kits onboard and limited testing capacity. Modly also said 104 Navy sailors and 31 U.S. Marines have tested positive around the world. ""We are trending higher,"" Modly said, regarding the Navy accounting for roughly one-third of all U.S. military positive cases. Top Pentagon officials have warned that the pandemic is showing no signs of letting up, with Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Army Gen. Mark Milley estimating that the outbreak will last in the U.S. for at least the next “three months.” Later, President Trump suggested reopening parts of the U.S. economy by Easter, which falls on April 12 this year, and argued he doesn’t want “to turn the country off” and see a continued economic downfall from the pandemic. But on Wednesday, Air Force Brig. Gen. Dr. Paul Friedrichs, a top Pentagon doctor, said that the potential easing of restrictions by a predetermined date could potentially “make this worse.” ""We're going to continue to see this – no surprise – continue to grow,"" Friedrichs told reporters. TOP PENTAGON OFFICIALS ESTIMATE COVID-19 OUTBREAK WILL LAST 3 MONTHS When asked by Fox News’ Jennifer Griffin if it was wise to ease restrictions by Easter, Friedrichs said he did not think there was a “great deal of value in speculating a particular date.” “What I would ask for everyone’s help with is worry about today,” he said. “Because if we stop doing the right thing today because we think something’s going to happen in four weeks, we will make this worse.” He added: ""I don't think it matters what day things start to get better. What matters is what we're doing right now to mitigate this outbreak. I'm not sure how to say it any more clearly than that.” As of Thursday morning, the U.S. reported more than 69,100 positive cases of COVID-19. Late Wednesday night, the death toll in the country exceeded 1,000.

"                          House Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy blasts Democrats for blocking a coronavirus relief package despite negotiations through the weekend. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.  Sign up here. House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy accused Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday of holding up the $2 trillion coronavirus response package to extract partisan goodies while struggling families and businesses paid the price. And McCarthy, of California, blasted the top Democrat, also from California, in tough terms for touting her side's wins in the final coronavirus bill, claiming the fundamentals actually were in place on Sunday and each day Democrats sought more concessions created additional hardship on real families. ""How many people were laid off as the Democrats fought to change the election law or implement the Green New Deal?"" McCarthy charged Thursday in a press conference. The Green New Deal was never included in the House proposal, but it did include measures meant to curb airline emissions. PELOSI HINTS AT WHAT DEMS COULD INCLUDE IN NEXT CORONAVIRUS BILL The $2 trillion stimulus bill to expand unemployment benefits, send direct payments to Americans, support small businesses and help industries hard hit by the economic shutdown passed the Senate unanimously late Wednesday. White House, GOP and Democratic negotiators worked around the clock to secure a deal with the text written just hours before passage in the upper chamber. McCarthy argued the plan could have been passed days sooner if Pelosi hadn't sought to change the bill. Senate Democrats rejected earlier versions of the package because they said it favored toward corporate bailouts over struggling workers. A few minutes before McCarthy spoke, Pelosi boasted that Democrats had “won the day” in obtaining what they wanted from the Senate’s $2.2 trillion coronavirus response stimulus package, while hinting at other items she would like to see included in a forthcoming bill. DO YOU QUALIFY FOR A STIMULUS CHECK IN SENATE’S CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE BILL? Pelosi described the negotiations as a “jiu-jitsu” moment in securing legislation that she described as worker-first instead of corporation-focused, but still said Democrats walked away with “not getting everything we want” out of the bill. But McCarthy bristled at Pelosi's claim of legislative “jiu-jitsu.” ""That is an outright lie,"" he said. ""The fundamental portions of this bill [have] not changed since Sunday,"" McCarthy said, claiming Democrats tried to turn a crisis to their own political gain. ""The only few additions were funding of things that had nothing to do with the coronavirus. Was that worth holding it up?"" McCarthy said, citing $25 million funding for the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C., down from the $35 million that House Democrats proposed. McCarthy continued railing against Pelosi. ""She spent time thanking her members on wins. America's suffering does not care to hear about these superficial and fabricated claims."" He added: ""What Democrats did was a total disgrace. History will not be kind to the days that added to the millions who were unemployed."" AOC ALLY PANS 'RIDICULOUS' PELOSI CLAIM ON CLIMATE CHANGE MEASURE IN CORONAVIRUS BILL The House will vote Friday and is expected to approve the massive legislation -- the biggest in U.S. history -- and send the bill to President Trump. Meanwhile, Pelosi was careful to stress that Democrats didn't get everything they wanted. “As I’ve said, there are so many things we didn’t get in any of these bills yet in a way that we need to,” Pelosi said, referring not just to the Senate bill but to two previous bills that had already been approved. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Among them are a “better definition of who qualifies for family and medical leave,” greater OSHA protection for workers, a proposal for pensions that Pelosi said Trump approved and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said could be in the next bill, a 15 percent increase in food stamps, and additional funds for state and local governments.

"                          As the COVID-19 pandemic is forcing Americans to shelter at home amid an election year, the government is ready to help states beef up mail-in voting with additional funds. Check out how the coronavirus stimulus package is set to make voting safer for all. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. The massive $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package President Trump is waiting to sign into law upon likely passage by the House of Representatives includes $400 million to help states move toward mail-in voting, amid a pandemic that is forcing many Americans to shelter at home. The funds would assist states as they expand voting by mail, early voting, online registration and make in-person voting safer for all. SENATE PASSES CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS BILL; ACTION MOVES TO HOUSE Lawmakers and election advocates are warning that if states don’t receive federal assistance to move away from in-person voting, there could be low turnout and disruptions in November’s general election. The coronavirus outbreak has upended the presidential nominating calendar, with many states postponing their remaining contests.  Mail-in voting was already the default option for three states that are scheduled to hold primaries on April 4: Alaska, Hawaii and Wyoming. Now all three states are moving to 100 percent vote-by-mail and are extending the deadlines for ballots to be delivered.  Among the states that have postponed their primaries until June, Georgia and Ohio are spending millions to send absentee ballots to voters. Currently three states – Colorado, Oregon and Washington – vote only by mail. More than a dozen other states allow mail-in-voting as an option. The $400 million in election funding in the bill passed by the Senate is up from $140 million proposed in the original bill assembled by Senate Republicans. Some Senate Democrats had pushed for $2 billion in funding. That was the price tag suggested last week by the non-partisan Brennan Center for Justice to help states make voting safe from the threat of coronavirus. The Brennan Center warned on Twitter that the funding in the Senate bill is “far less than election officials need to hold a safe, fair, accurate election in Nov. Congress needs to make up the difference ASAP.” Some Republican lawmakers oppose coronavirus stimulus funding to beef up voting by mail, arguing that it has nothing to do with helping workers, small businesses and large companies devastated by the shutdown of much of the economy due to the pandemic. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION Among the critics was GOP Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, who tweeted earlier this week that early voting and other elements pushed by Democrats do “nothing” to help workers and small businesses “survive the coronavirus crisis.”    ",         Coronavirus package has $400 million to help states beef up mail-in voting,         2020-03-26T101115-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/400-million-in-coronavirus-package-to-help-states-beef-up-mail-in-voting,Fox

A total of 3.28 million people filed for unemployment insurance in the week ended March 21, dwarfing previous highs in Labor Department reports published since 1967. Two weeks earlier, before the closures swept across vast swaths of the country, the number stood at 211,000, close to a half-century low. ‘This shows the severity of the downturn, and the speed of it,’ said Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America Corp. ‘It speaks to the unusual nature of this recession -- it is an abrupt plunge into recession versus prior downturns, where the shock has time to multiply. We could have very high numbers continue for the next few weeks.’”Pelosi sets targets for next bailout package - Roll Call: “Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday laid out Democratic demands for the next phase of the legislative coronavirus response – a day before the House is scheduled to vote on an estimated $2.2 trillion deal that is the largest economic assistance package in U.S. history. Pelosi said she spoke with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday morning and laid out her wish list for follow-up legislation: ‘A better definition of who qualifies for family and medical leave’; Health care worker and pension protections, which she said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said could be done in the next phase; Increasing SNAP benefits by 15 percent; More funds to state and local governments; Free coronavirus testing, doctor visits and follow-up treatment; Equitable funding for Washington, D.C., residents. ‘It doesn’t make any sense,’ she said of the Senate’s decision to treat D.C. as a territory rather than a state, which deprives the district of at least $750 million more in emergency funding.”Feds set to take ownership stakes in airlines - WSJ: “Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin indicated that the U.S. government would take stakes in airline carriers in exchange for billions in direct grants to the companies, part of a $2 trillion economic rescue package, according to people familiar with the matter. He detailed his plans during last-minute negotiations when the aid to airlines emerged as a major sticking point. Republicans had rejected providing cash grants to airlines, and an earlier version of the legislation would have provided $50 billion in loans and loan guarantees to passenger airlines and $8 billion to cargo airlines—but no direct aid.”How lobbyists loaded legislation with special provisions - NYT: “Many of these special-interest provisions would be impossible for a casual reader of the legislation to identify. For example, on Page 15 of the bill, there is a section with the title ‘Business Concerns With More Than 1 Physical Location.’ It says this change in federal law will apply to companies that fit ‘a North American Industry Classification System code beginning with 72’ — a reference that turns out to mean the hotel and restaurant industry. The provision says that if a company owns multiple hotels, even if the overall hotel or restaurant chain has more than 500 employees — the limit to qualify for treatment as a small business — it will still be able to take advantage of the small-business benefits offered in the rescue package.”Senators head home until April 20 - CNBC: “Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the chamber would adjourn for nearly a month after it passed a historically huge $2 trillion coronavirus relief package late Wednesday night. But as the outbreak takes a toll on American health and financial well-being, the unprecedented crisis may force Congress to act again sooner than the Senate’s planned return date of April 20. McConnell acknowledged the reality Wednesday night, promising the chamber would stay ‘nimble’ as the pandemic spreads. ‘If circumstances require the Senate to return for a vote sooner than April the 20th, we will provide at least 24 hours of notice,’ he said.”Vacancies, inexperience hamper federal response - NYT: “Of the 75 senior positions at the Department of Homeland Security, 20 are either vacant or filled by acting officials, including Chad F. Wolf, the acting secretary who recently was unable to tell a Senate committee how many respirators and protective face masks were available in the United States. The National Park Service, which like many federal agencies is full of vacancies in key posts, tried this week to fill the job of a director for the national capital region after hordes of visitors flocked to see the cherry blossoms near the National Mall, creating a potential public health hazard as the coronavirus continues to spread. At the Department of Veterans Affairs, workers are scrambling to order medical supplies on Amazon after its leaders, lacking experience in disaster responses, failed to prepare for the onslaught of patients at its medical centers.”ABORTION PROVIDERS SUE OVER TEXAS EMERGENCY BANFox News: “Planned Parenthood Federation of America, along with other pro-choice groups, filed a lawsuit Wednesday against Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, Attorney General Ken Paxton and several other state officials over a temporary ban on elective abortion during the coronavirus pandemic. The ban was issued as part of an executive order by Abbott aimed at conserving medical equipment and the capacity of the health care system after warnings from health care professionals that patients sick with the coronavirus might overwhelm hospital capacity and deplete supplies, such as personal protective equipment for doctors and nurses. Pro-choice activists say the ban was issued in bad faith and limits access to an ‘essential’ procedure.”Pastor touts mass gatherings in Louisiana, a virus hotspot - USA Today: “A Louisiana pastor continues to defy the state’s orders prohibiting gatherings of more than 50 people by holding church services, the latest of which he claimed had over 1,000 attendees. The Rev. Tony Spell, who claims that congregants at Life Tabernacle Church in the city of Central City, about 15 miles northeast of Baton Rouge, have been cured of cancer and HIV, said that coronavirus is ‘politically motivated.’ Spell claims that around 1,000 churchgoers, who the church has bussed in from five different parishes in Louisiana, have attended his church every Sunday despite state recommendations against mass gatherings. Additional services on Tuesday, he added, attract an additional few hundred churchgoers.”THE RULEBOOK: CONSTITUTIONAL SHORTLIST“The principal purposes to be answered by union are these the common defense of the members; the preservation of the public peace as well against internal convulsions as external attacks; the regulation of commerce with other nations and between the States; the superintendence of our intercourse, political and commercial, with foreign countries.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 23TIME OUT: MAMMOTH, MANHistory: “On March 26, 1804, President Thomas Jefferson attends a public party at the Senate and leads a diverse crowd in consuming an enormous loaf of bread dubbed the mammoth loaf. … Early Americans’ use of the descriptive term mammoth arose from the discovery of a giant woolly mammoth skeleton in New York in 1801. Jefferson, fascinated with the natural sciences, was a member of the American Philosophical Society and helped the organization raise funds to complete the archaeological project. Jefferson’s Federalist opponents ridiculed the president’s scientific side projects as frivolous. In an attempt to embarrass the president, they dubbed the giant dairy product the mammoth cheese. To the Federalists’ surprise and disappointment, the general populace embraced the term with nationalistic zeal. Almost immediately, butcher shops and markets advertised mammoth-size products… The unveiling of the mammoth loaf occurred at a Senate-sponsored March 26 party to rally support for a naval war against the Barbary States.”        Flag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARDESTIMATED DELEGATES FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATIONBiden: 1,215Sanders: 910[Ed. note: 1,991 delegates needed to win]TRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE Average approval: 45.4 percentAverage disapproval: 49.6 percentNet Score: -4.2 percentChange from one week ago: ↑ 3.8 points[Average includes: Gallup: 49% approve - 45% disapprove; Monmouth University: 48% approve - 48% disapprove; NPR/PBS News/Marist: 43% approve - 50% disapprove; NBC News/WSJ: 46% approve - 51% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 41% approve - 54% disapprove.]I’LL TELL YOU WHAT: WHEN DOVES CRYThis week, Dana Perino and Chris Stirewalt touch base from their secure, undisclosed locations.

It now confers a huge bounty of delegates, second only to Super Tuesday in early March, with Indiana, Pennsylvania and others moving to hold their primaries on the first Tuesday in June.

Bernie Sanders next month. At a virtual news briefing on the coronavirus pandemic conducted from his home in Delaware, Biden was asked about the Sanders campaign’s statement to The New York Times on Tuesday that the senator would appear in an April debate if the Democratic National Committee proceeded with organizing the event. Pressed on whether he, too, would participate, Biden said: ‘My focus is just dealing with this crisis right now. I haven’t thought about any more debates. I think we’ve had enough debates.

But people close to him say he has recently become increasingly explicit that he may be choosing his own replacement, and that the candidates’ competence is now likely to be front and center in his considerations. ‘He’s been clear that he wants to pick someone who can be president if something happens to him,’ a senior Democrat in close contact with the Biden team told me. It’s a point he’s made on recent calls with political allies, and even with his former boss.”Dems to seek mail-in mandate for November - Roll Call: “For example, House Administration Chairwoman Zoe Lofgren of California said Democrats must secure a federal mandate requiring states to provide vote-by-mail or other remote options in the presidential election, with funding for state implementation. Democrats secured $400 million in election assistance in the phase three bill, but a federal vote-by-mail mandate would cost roughly $4 billion to implement, according to a senior Democratic aide.”TEAM TRUMP TRIES TO PUSH SUPER PAC INTO ACTIONPolitico: “In interviews, more than a half-dozen White House aides, campaign officials and other Trump allies said they felt deserted by the group, America First Action, openly questioning why it’s leaving [President Trump] exposed on the airwaves at the most vulnerable moment of his presidency. ‘There is a major vacuum on the political front right now, with the White House focused on coronavirus response and the campaign, rightly so, echoing the White House,’ said Chris LaCivita, who as chief strategist of the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth orchestrated the 2004 John Kerry takedown. ‘With attacks coming from all over, the simple question is: Where the hell is the president’s air cover?’ The campaign is legally barred from communicating directly with the super PAC. Trump’s reelection effort itself is not currently attacking Biden on the airwaves during the pandemic because it wants to focus on echoing the president's message.”GOPers with 2024 hopes look for distance from Trump - WashEx: “Prominent Republicans eyeing a 2024 White House bid have placed themselves at the epicenter of efforts to blunt the coronavirus pandemic, with some departing from President Trump by proposing an extended and more aggressive economic shutdown. As Trump floats reopening a quarantined national economy by Easter, two Republican senators with presidential aspirations, Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Rick Scott of Florida, support tightening current restrictions and maintaining them for at least 30 days. Scott’s eight-point plan would suspend domestic airline travel and place a moratorium on people’s monthly financial obligations.

But, as their employer, can the voters impose some rules to govern the two bodies? For example, I think most voters would support a rule that would be binding on both bodies to keep each bill passed relevant to the main issue being addressed by the bill. It would guarantee that we avoid important pieces of legislation being loaded up with ‘wish list’ items, such as what's been happening with the coronavirus measure.” – Lou Banas, Brea, Calif.[Ed. note: There is indeed such a way, Mr. Banas! Unfortunately for your ambitions, that way is to elect members who wish to change the rules of their respective bodies to so bind them. But even if you did that, you might find that, as with term limits and balanced-budget amendments, they would lose their ardor for the reforms once they were in power. Then there’s the other question about deciding what is or isn’t germane. What you consider irrelevant, another might consider crucial, and vice versa. The Senate could empower its parliamentarian to make such rulings more often, but then the parliamentarian would, in effect, become a super senator with the power to veto any changes to legislation. So who should decide what’s relevant? The obvious answer would be that the members themselves should vote, which brings us… right back to where we started.]“Read with interest your commentary that the President had already given back ‘the bump’ attributed to his role in the crisis.

"                          2020 Democrat hopeful Joe Biden kicks off what he says will be daily livestreams on the coronavirus response. Former Vice President Joe Biden wants Americans to know how he’d implement the massive $2 trillion coronavirus package to jumpstart the economy if he were in the White House. The all-but-certain Democratic presidential nominee on Thursday unveiled his plan for implementing the funding, which aims to rescue workers, small businesses and large companies devastated by an economy that’s been largely shut down as many Americans huddle in their homes to prevent the spread of the pandemic.  WHAT'S IN THE MASSIVE $2 TRILLION CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS PACKAGE President Trump is waiting to sign the bill into law after likely passage by the House of Representatives on Friday. The bipartisan measure passed the Senate 96-0 late Wednesday night. “The United States Senate just reached a deal on a major economic relief package. It’s a very important step and includes support for families and small businesses, the very things I’ve been calling for for a while now. And when it passes, the key will be its execution,” Biden said in a video that accompanied his plan. Biden outlined steps he “would do immediately” to make the plan work, including using “all available authorities,” including the much-discussed Defense Production Act, to help stop the spread of COVID-19, the diseased spread by the coronavirus outbreak. President Trump invoked the law last week – but has been criticized by Democrats for not yet implementing a key provision that would require private companies to immediately prioritize production of supplies desperately needed by hospitals and medical workers on the frontlines in the fight to combat the coronavirus. Biden also said that he’d bring congressional leaders together to hammer out the next deal. Biden said among the items he’d push for in the next package would be providing student loan forgiveness for at least $10,000 per person, Social Security increases, full paid sick leave for our workers, and if needed more direct cash relief. Biden took aim at the president for his suggestion this week that social distancing mandates could be relaxed next month in order to get the country back to work “In recent days, there’s been talk that we have to choose between public health and our economy,” Biden said. “That’s simply a false choice and a dangerous one. It would be catastrophic to reopen everything without a plan, and then have a spike in cases and shut it back down.” THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN  The former vice president also said if he were in the White House he’d “appoint a task force reporting directly to me to make sure that every single dollar going out the door gets to the people who need it the most.” He said that would include keeping workers on the payroll, keeping “small business in business throughout this crisis,” and he said that “I would call in the major banks and tell them to get those small business loans out the door. If they don’t make small business a priority, I would seek authority, similar to the Defense Production Act, to make sure that they had to do that.” Biden added that he’d insist that CEOs of larger companies “make hard commitments so they will put the aid toward their workers, not enriching CEOs or shareholders.” Pointing to Trump, Biden stressed that “Congress is doing its job. The president has to do his now.

Rodney ""Rocky"" Sickmann was a young Marine serving at the U.S. Embassy in Iran on Nov. 4, 1979, when an Iranian mob overwhelmed the compound and took Sickmann and dozens of others hostage. In a new episode of Fox Nation's series, ""Bible Study: Messages of Hope,"" Dan Rooney, an Air Force lieutenant colonel and founder of the veterans' charity, Folds of Honor, recounted his conversation with Sickmann about coping with isolation and how Americans can apply those lessons today. ""When he hit these moments, perspective is so important for everybody,"" explained Rooney on ""Fox and Friends"" on Thursday, ""Just like baseball, America will be back. It's suffering is relative."" ""On Nov. 4, 1979, [Sickmann's] life was changed when he was taken hostage as a Marine in Iran,"" said Rooney, ""It's different obviously, but the coronavirus has us all hostage.  Our normals lives have ceased to exist."" Sickmann and 51 fellow Americans were held for 444 days and subjected to extreme isolation and mental and physical abuse amounting to torture. For the first 30 days of his captivity, Sickmann was chained to a chair and was only allowed outside seven times throughout his entire ordeal. Rooney said that Sickmann told him that there were three things that enabled him to make it through 444 days in captivity, and Rooney detailed those lessons in the Fox Nation episode. ""Number one, prayer, deep, real conversations with God. The second thing was a codependency on his two friends that he spent most of his time in isolation with. And the third thing was his mind,"" said Rooney. According to Sickmann, the action of recalling happy family moments had the power to transport him out of his dire circumstances into a positive mindset. AIR FORCE LT COL STARTED VETS' CHARITY AFTER WITNESSES DISRESPECT FOR A FALLEN HERO ""Our mind is such an amazing tool. Rocky Sickmann, thank God, was released on Jan. 21, 1981,"" continued Rooney. ""But it is an awesome reminder to all of us, as a hostage of a different kind – this coronavirus, that we are still blessed."" ""The one universal truth as Americans throughout history is we have struggled, but we have always come out the other side stronger. Together we will rise.

Then obviously, the hospitals and the staff working on the front lines there, they’re putting in extra hours, extra work, exposing themselves. “We thought this was a way to help. Two birds with one stone. We can help local restaurants. We can help the hospitals and the workers and show our appreciation.” HEARTWARMING MOMENT MOM SURPRISES DAUGHTER IN ISOLATION FOR HER BIRTHDAY ** RUSSELL WILSON, SEATTLE SEAHAWKS Russell Wilson was among the first NFL stars to start jumping in and helping coronavirus relief efforts.

He pledged to cover the salaries of Smoothie King Center workers during the time of crisis. “My mother has always set an example for me about being respectful for others and being grateful for what we have, and so today I am pledging to cover the salaries for all of those Smoothie King Center workers for the next 30 days,” Williamson wrote on Instagram. “This is a small way for me to express my support and appreciation for these wonderful people who have been so great to me and my teammates and hopefully we can all join together to relieve some of the stress and hardship caused by this national health crisis. This is an incredibly resilient city full of some of the most resilient people, but sometimes providing a little extra assistance can make things a little easier for the community.” ** ZLATAN IBRAHIMOVIC, AC MILAN Zlatan Ibrahimovic moved from the LA Galaxy to AC Milan and, with Italian soccer shuttered for the foreseeable future, did his part to “kick the coronavirus away.” His fundraiser raised thousands of dollars for Humanitas hospitals. “Let's together kick the coronavirus away and win this match and remember, if the virus doesn't go to Zlatan, Zlatan goes to the virus,” he said in a video posted on Twitter.

Among them are a “better definition of who qualifies for family and medical leave,” greater OSHA protection for workers, a proposal for pensions that Pelosi said President Trump approved and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said could be in the next bill, a 15 percent increase in food stamps, and additional funds for state and local governments. Pelosi also called for additional free medical services related to coronavirus “We said free testing, free testing, free testing, but with free testing is the visit to the doctor’s office, the treatment that goes with it, and that has to be free as well,” she said, so people will not be discouraged from getting tested out of fear of having to pay large sums for treatment.

"                          Senate unanimously approves $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package; White House trade adviser Peter Navarro joins ‘America’s Newsroom.’ Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. The White House on Thursday said the record surge in unemployment claims is “to be totally expected” and “no surprise” considering the nationwide response to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. The latest numbers were released Thursday morning revealing that Americans filing for unemployment benefits surged to 3.28 million last week as the coronavirus pandemic forced businesses around the country to close. SENATE PASSES $2T STIMULUS BILL BY UNANIMOUS CONSENT AMID COVID-19 PANDEMIC The Labor Department said Thursday that the new number eclipsed the previous record of 695,000, which was set in 1982, and is well above the levels seen during the 2008 financial crisis. But the White House said Thursday that the latest numbers are no surprise, amid the Trump administration’s coronavirus strategy. “This is to be totally expected because the whole strategy of President Trump is to basically get social distancing so that we can combat the virus and put public health above economics in the very, very short run, so this is no surprise,” White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said on “America’s Newsroom” Thursday. “We should accept the news because we’re doing what we need to do to combat the virus,” he continued, adding that the more than $2 trillion stimulus package awaiting approval by the House of Representatives outlines “targeted relief, particularly for low-income workers” and “targeted industry relief.” US UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS SHATTER RECORD AS COVID-19 HAMMERS ECONOMY “Nobody understands the pain more than this White House,” Navarro said of the American workers who have lost their jobs due to the spread of COVID-19. “We are attuned to their plight and we’re going to try to get them that cash cushion as soon as possible, the loan window open for small businesses … what we’ve been waiting for is Congress to do their thing.” He added: “President Trump and his team are doing everything we possibly can to deal both with public health emergency and the economic crisis.” White House spokesman Judd Deere also weighed in, saying that ""Americans are making enormous sacrifices and he is grateful for their spirit."" ""The large increase in unemployment claims is just one of the many reasons why President Trump committed weeks ago to take care of all Americans, including affected industries and small businesses, so that we emerge from this challenge stronger and with a prosperous and growing economy,"" Deere said in a statement to Fox News. Navarro and Deere's comments come after Trump, during a Fox News virtual town hall on Monday, said he “would love to have the country opened up” by Easter, which falls on April 12 this year. The president has argued that he doesn’t want “to turn the country off” and see a continued economic downfall from the coronavirus pandemic. He also said he worries that the country will see “suicides by the thousands” if the novel coronavirus devastates the economy. “We lose thousands and thousands of people a year to the flu. We don’t turn the country off,” Trump said during the town hall. “We lose much more than that to automobile accidents. We don’t call up the automobile companies and say stop making cars.” He added: “We have to get back to work.” White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham appeared to soften the president’s message Tuesday, after harsh criticism from state officials, medical professionals and the media, saying that she thinks Trump “would love it if we were open up for business yesterday.” “After the 15 days, when we see the data come in, we’ll see where we’re at and I think the president will make his decision,” Grisham said on “Fox & Friends.” “But he is hopeful.” The White House, earlier this month, implemented a policy called “15 days to slow the spread,” which included social distancing, working from home when possible, and avoiding gatherings of more than 10 people in order to curb the spread of COVID-19. Many states have forced non-essential businesses to close during the pandemic. Meanwhile, Coronavirus Task Force member Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Health, said on ""The Ingraham Angle"" Wednesday that the president's Easter timeline is ""aspirational."" Fauci added: ""He's been very flexible about it, even though it looks like he's made this absolute decision on something. He does have an open mind about it."" Meanwhile, the Senate late Wednesday passed a massive $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package, ending days of deadlock. The bill was sent to the House, where Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., will soon take up the historic measure to bring relief to individuals, small businesses, and larger corporations. The package would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of up to $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year, and $2,400 to married couples making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child. After a $75,000 threshold for individuals, the benefit would be reduced by $5 for each $100 the taxpayer makes. A similar $150,000 threshold applies to couples, and a $112,500 threshold for heads of households. The legislation passed by the Senate will use 2019 tax returns, if available, or 2018 tax returns to assess income for determining how much direct financial aid individuals receive. Those who did not file tax returns can use a Form SSA-1099, Social Security Benefit Statement or Form RRB-1099, a Social Security Equivalent Benefit Statement, per page 149 of the bill. Further, the bill allocates $250 billion to extend unemployment insurance to more workers, and lengthen the duration to 39 weeks, up from the normal 26 weeks -- $600 extra a week would be provided for four months. The final package would additionally provide $349 billion in loans to small businesses -- and money spent on rent, payroll and utilities become grants that don't need to be paid back. Many hotels would qualify as small businesses under the plan. The House is slated to take up the measure for a final vote on Friday.

"                          Amid the COVID-19 outbreak, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot is cracking down on the spread of the coronavirus. Check out the latest on her most recent order to the citizens of Chicago. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot is warning residents not to go on long runs or bike rides in the city’s latest effort to crack down over the spread of coronavirus, even cautioning that residents could be arrested should they break the rules. Lightfoot, during remarks Wednesday, reportedly urged residents to “stay at home” and “only go out for essentials” —rules put in place by Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker last week. NEW JERSEY 'STAY AT HOME ORDER' ISSUED TO HALT CORONAVIRUS SPREAD But Lightfoot took the order a step further. “Be smart,” Lightfoot said Wednesday, according to  CBS Chicago. “Not only will our police be deployed to shut them down if you are not abiding by these orders, we will be forced to shut down the parks and lakefront.” Lightfoot went on to announce that spending long periods of time outside or in playgrounds is not allowed. “You cannot go on long bike rides. Playgrounds are shut down,” she said. “You must abide by the order. Outside is for a brief respite, not for 5Ks.” She added: “I can’t emphasize enough that we abide [by] the rules.” The parks in Chicago are still open, according to the city, but officials warned residents to keep their distance from others. ""This is an order that’s enforceable by law,"" she reportedly said. ""We’re going to give you an admonition. And if you don’t turn right away and head home then you’re going to get a citation. And if worse, yeah, we will take you into custody."" She added: ""I hope that it doesn’t come to that, I hope that I don’t have to shut down the lake front, shut down all the parks, but I will."" The Chicago police doubled down on the warning that violations are punishable by a fine of $500 and potentially arrest. LOCKDOWNS, STAY AT HOME POLICIES MULTIPLY AS CORONAVIRUS CASES, DEATHS IN THE US MOUNT An accompanying press release, though, did not appear to place restrictions on the extent of outdoor exercise that Chicagoans are able to do, aside from telling people to keep their distance from others. The press release from the mayor's office said: ""Chicagoans are still able, and encouraged, to do the following during this time: Go for a walk or run but maintain physical distance from others while doing so; walk their dog, but not congregate at the dog park or beach; visit one of the City's public parks and outdoor recreation areas that remain open for use during regular operating hours but avoid clustering in groups."" The statement also said Chicagoans are able, like in other states and localities, to ""shop at the grocery stores that remain open, as long as you are not sick, and practice social distancing"" and ""continue visiting the restaurants that remain open for pick-up and delivery."" Chicago’s measures come as a number of states across the nation issued similar “stay at home” orders. Pritzker, last Friday, announced Illinois’ own version of a ""shelter-in-place"" order, which began over the weekend and is expected to continue at least through April 7. Pritzker’s order came after California Gov. Gavin Newsom, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont issued similar orders, which closed non-essential businesses and urged residents to work from home unless they are an essential worker. In New York, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S., Gov. Andrew Cuomo made exceptions for media, health care providers and financial institutions, among others, were made as well, with workers falling into the category of ""essential workers."" The statewide orders urge people to practice social distancing and only leave their homes for necessities such as groceries, picking up medications and seeking medical attention. And in New Jersey, Murphy banned birthday parties and funerals. COVID-19 was designated a pandemic by the World Health Organization earlier this month. As of Thursday morning, the U.S. reported more than 69,100 positive cases of COVID-19. Late Wednesday night, the death toll in the country exceeded 1,000.

President Trump on Thursday said the administration is working to publish new guidelines that will advise governors in states across the nation on potential changes to social distancing, based on whether certain counties are low, medium or high risk for the novel coronavirus. In a letter from the president to “America’s Governors,” Trump thanked state leaders for “stepping up to help America confront this unprecedented global pandemic.” WHITE HOUSE SAYS RECORD SURGE IN UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS 'NO SURPRISE' AMID CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE  “Together we are proving that no challenge can match the indomitable strength, ingenuity, and determination of the American people,” Trump wrote. “There is still a long battle ahead, but our efforts are already paying dividends,” he continued, noting that “the day will soon arrive” when Americans can resume their “normal economic, social, and religious lives.” CORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN Trump said the administration is “working to publish new guidelines for State and local policymakers to use in making decisions about maintaining, increasing, or relaxing social distancing and other mitigation measures they have put in place.” The president said that the White House envisions that the expanded testing capabilities will “enable us to publish criteria, developed in close coordination with the Nation’s public health officials and scientists, to help classify counties with respect to continued risks posed by the virus.” “This will incorporate robust surveillance testing, which allows us to monitor the spread of the virus throughout the country,” Trump explained. “Under these data-driven criteria, we will suggest guidelines categorizing counties as high-risk, medium-risk, or low-risk.” He added: “This new information will drive the next phase in our war against the invisible enemy.” The White House, earlier this month, implemented a policy called “15 days to slow the spread,” which included social distancing, working from home when possible, and avoiding gatherings of more than 10 people in order to curb the spread of COVID-19. Many states have forced non-essential businesses to close during the pandemic. That 15-day period ends on Monday, March 30.  It is unclear, at this point, what new guidelines would be. “The virus has inflicted a heavy toll on our country. A number of our fellow citizens have tragically succumbed to its ravages, while many more are fighting for their lives,"" Trump wrote. ""We mourn alongside those who have lost loved ones, and we send our prayers for the recovery of all who are still sick."" He added: ""In their honor, we pledge to marshal every resource and power we have to overcome and vanquish this threat."" The president’s message to governors comes after he, earlier this week during a Fox News virtual town hall, said he “would love to have the country opened up” by Easter, which falls on April 12. SENATE PASSES $2T CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS PACKAGE The president has argued that he doesn’t want “to turn the country off” and see a continued economic downfall from the coronavirus pandemic. He also said he worries that the country will see “suicides by the thousands” if the novel coronavirus devastates the economy. “We lose thousands and thousands of people a year to the flu. We don’t turn the country off,” Trump said during the town hall. “We lose much more than that to automobile accidents. We don’t call up the automobile companies and say stop making cars.” He added: “We have to get back to work.” Coronavirus Task Force member Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Health, on Wednesday warned that the president's Easter timeline is “aspirational.” Fauci added: ""He's been very flexible about it, even though it looks like he's made this absolute decision on something.

"                          President Trump congratulates America after the Senate unanimously passes the stimulus bill, but some lawmakers say it may not be enough; Kristin Fisher reports from the White House. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. After days of partisan tension, the Senate late Wednesday approved a massive $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief package aimed at beating back the pandemic and directing immediate economic aid to Americans who are losing their jobs by the millions as businesses close their doors to slow the spread of the disease. The bill is expected to pass the House of Representatives overwhelmingly and be signed by President Trump within days. If enacted, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) will be the single most expensive piece of legislation in U.S. history. To put the size in context, that's more than double the cost of the entire New Deal, even when adjusted for inflation. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW       In this image from video, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., speaks on the Senate floor at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Saturday, March 21, 2020. (Senate Television via AP)       DO YOU QUALIFY FOR A STIMULUS CHECK IN THE SENATE'S CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE BILL The $2.2 trillion of new spending in the bill is about 10 percent of the United States' yearly GDP and nearly half of what the U.S. government spent in all of 2019. Rhetoric from members of Congress has been as soaring as the cost of the bill, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer comparing the fight against the coronavirus to war in floor remarks Wednesday night. ""None of us can know when this plague will pass,"" Schumer said. ""The only thing we know for sure is that we must summon the same spirit that saw previous generations of Americans through our nation’s darkest hours. Fellowship. Sacrifice. Fortitude. Resilience."" He continued: ""This is what it means to be an American. With that spirit, this nation faced down war and depression and fear itself. I have no doubt that, once again, America will ultimately prevail."" Though it's not an exact apples-to-apples comparison due to population and other changes over time, here's how the coronavirus stimulus stacks up against some of the most ambitious legislative efforts of the past 100 years. DOCTORS IN DISTRESS, QUARANTINE SEND SOS FOR MORE PROTECTIVE GEAR, TESTS: 'IT'S A COMPLETE MESS' New Deal - $856.1 billion, adjusted for inflation When former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt took office in 1933, the United States was in the throes of the Great Depression, which to this day is considered the worst economic depression the U.S. has ever faced. His New Deal, which was actually a large number of bills passed over several years rather than a single piece of legislation, cost $41.7 billion in 1933 dollars, which is the equivalent of $856.1 billion today. That means the coronavirus stimulus package being moved in the U.S. Congress right now will more than double the cost of what is widely considered to be the most expansive domestic legislative program in American history. Marshall Plan - $144 billion, adjusted for inflation The Marshall Plan was the United States' post-World War II strategy to rebuild Western Europe, which was decimated from years of fighting across the continent. The effort didn't just help European allies whose schools, businesses and infrastructure had in some cases been reduced to rubble. It also set the table for the Cold War, with Western European countries siding with the U.S. and capitalism over Soviet communism. The Marshall Plan cost $13.3 billion when enacted -- the equivalent of $144 billion in 2020 -- and was signed into law by former President Harry Truman in April 1948. Great Recession laws - $1.8 trillion combined, adjusted for inflation CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The 2008 financial crisis, which was followed by the Great Recession, was one of the most severe economic downturns in U.S. history. To help dig the country out, former President George W. Bush signed the Temporary Asset Relief Program (TARP) which cost $700 billion in 2008 dollars. With the U.S. economy still sputtering, former President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) in 2008, which was an $831 billion economic stimulus package. Combined, and adjusted for inflation, those two pieces of legislation total $1.8 trillion in 2020 dollars. That is $400 billion less than the CARES Act.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. The Trump administration is pushing to add language to a coronavirus resolution at the U.N. Security Council that would say explicitly that the virus originated in China -- part of the administration’s efforts to keep the focus on the communist regime. “All members of the Security Council must recognize the threat that China’s mishandling of the outbreak poses to international peace and security,” a State Department official told Fox News. “The People’s Republic of China has been more interested in saving face than saving lives.” TRUMP DEFENDS ACTION IN EARLY DAYS OF CORONAVIRUS CRISIS, BLAMES CHINA FOR BEING SECRETIVE  NBC News first reported that talks at the council over a joint declaration or resolution on the global pandemic have stalled over the U.S. demand that it explicitly name Wuhan as the source of the virus. But the outlet reported that it has enraged diplomats from China -- a country that holds veto power at the Security Council. A source with knowledge of the situation confirmed to Fox News that the U.S. suggested language that would name Wuhan, China, and that the Chinese were unhappy about the push. The source told Fox News that a similar debate was happening with an upcoming statement by G-7 leaders. The State Department official said that the U.S. backs a resolution that would praise first responders and medical personnel and reinforce the importance of international cooperation, as well as the need for all member states to act quickly and with full transparency to end the pandemic. It would also back a resolution that demands a pause to all hostilities to enable the international community to quickly tackle the spread of the virus. TRUMP TARGETS CHINA FOR CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK, SAYS 'THE WORLD IS PAYING A BIG PRICE'  But the official also noted that, since the virus broke in China, Beijing has a “special responsibility” to be fully transparent about the virus: “Instead they suppressed information and punished doctors and journalists who raised the alarm.” “We call on PRC authorities to provide accurate and prompt public health reporting, timely access to all relevant information, and respect for freedom of expression so that lessons learned, best practices, and innovations can be shared freely between peoples to facilitate the most globally effective response to minimize deaths,” the official said.

The Trump re-election campaign offices will remain closed through at least April 24, after Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam issued statewide guidelines for nonessential businesses to close amid the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, Fox News has learned. Trump campaign staffers were informed last night that its offices in Arlington, Va. -- where the bulk of the re-election operation is based -- will stay closed through the end of next month. Employees are being asked to continue to work from home, which they have been doing for the last two weeks. CHICAGO CRACKS DOWN OVER CORONAVIRUS, TELLS RESIDENTS DON'T GO ON LONG RUNS OR BIKE RIDES A senior campaign official told Fox News that they “had no choice” after Northam’s order. “Our lawyers advised it could be a misdemeanor to fail to comply,” another senior staffer explained. Northam followed suit of governors in New York, California, Illinois, New Jersey and Connecticut in implementing orders that encouraged residents to stay home and work from home when possible, and closed nonessential businesses. But the Trump campaign has insisted that the COVID-19 pandemic is having minimal impact on its ability to connect with voters due to its digital savvy and extensive voter database. The campaign said that volunteers made 1.5 million phone calls in a single day last week, all while working from home. BIDEN'S CLAIM HE 'BECAME A PROFESSOR' AFTER LEAVING THE SENATE SPARK CONFUSION “We didn’t make 1.5 million phone calls in any week in 2018 until the fall, and we just did that in a single day in March,” a top campaign official said, comparing the rate of calls to their efforts during the 2018 midterm election cycle. “Everything is continuing at an even higher pace than usual, except for in-person events.” At this point, there is no timeline, and there has been minimal discussion, as to when the campaign could hold its next rally. Meanwhile, the campaign is anticipating that Joe Biden will be the Democratic nominee after the former vice president reclaimed his front-runner status on Super Tuesday and in subsequent primary contests. Biden, during the coronavirus outbreak rocking the nation, has been hosting virtual press conferences. The former vice president hosted his first “virtual town hall” last week, which was marred with technical gaffes and ended after only five minutes. Biden has continued to host the virtual town halls since, with the latest sparking confusion after the former vice president said he ""became a professor"" after leaving the Senate. Biden, quite notably, became vice president of the United States under President Obama when he left the Senate in 2009. It was, however, in 2017 when he received the title of ""Benjamin Franklin Presidential Practice Professor"" from the University of Pennsylvania.

"                          2020 Democrat hopeful Joe Biden kicks off what he says will be daily livestreams on the coronavirus response. Former Vice President Joe Biden wants Americans to know how he’d implement the massive $2 trillion coronavirus package to jumpstart the economy if he were in the White House. The all-but-certain Democratic presidential nominee on Thursday unveiled his plan for implementing the funding, which aims to rescue workers, small businesses and large companies devastated by an economy that’s been largely shut down as many Americans huddle in their homes to prevent the spread of the pandemic.  WHAT'S IN THE MASSIVE $2 TRILLION CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS PACKAGE President Trump is waiting to sign the bill into law after likely passage by the House of Representatives on Friday. The bipartisan measure passed the Senate 96-0 late Wednesday night. “The United States Senate just reached a deal on a major economic relief package. It’s a very important step and includes support for families and small businesses, the very things I’ve been calling for for a while now. And when it passes, the key will be its execution,” Biden said in a video that accompanied his plan. Biden outlined steps he “would do immediately” to make the plan work, including using “all available authorities,” including the much-discussed Defense Production Act, to help stop the spread of COVID-19, the diseased spread by the coronavirus outbreak. President Trump invoked the law last week – but has been criticized by Democrats for not yet implementing a key provision that would require private companies to immediately prioritize production of supplies desperately needed by hospitals and medical workers on the frontlines in the fight to combat the coronavirus. Biden also said that he’d bring congressional leaders together to hammer out the next deal. Biden said among the items he’d push for in the next package would be providing student loan forgiveness for at least $10,000 per person, Social Security increases, full paid sick leave for our workers, and if needed more direct cash relief. Biden took aim at the president for his suggestion this week that social distancing mandates could be relaxed next month in order to get the country back to work “In recent days, there’s been talk that we have to choose between public health and our economy,” Biden said. “That’s simply a false choice and a dangerous one. It would be catastrophic to reopen everything without a plan, and then have a spike in cases and shut it back down.” THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN  The former vice president also said if he were in the White House he’d “appoint a task force reporting directly to me to make sure that every single dollar going out the door gets to the people who need it the most.” He said that would include keeping workers on the payroll, keeping “small business in business throughout this crisis,” and he said that “I would call in the major banks and tell them to get those small business loans out the door. If they don’t make small business a priority, I would seek authority, similar to the Defense Production Act, to make sure that they had to do that.” Biden added that he’d insist that CEOs of larger companies “make hard commitments so they will put the aid toward their workers, not enriching CEOs or shareholders.” Pointing to Trump, Biden stressed that “Congress is doing its job. The president has to do his now. This is all about implementation."" The president's re-election campaign, responding to Biden's plan, said it ""is late to the game, plagiarizing from the Trump Adminisration's plan while brazenly taking advantage of the crisis to ram through radical left-wing pet projects that have nothing to do with the coronavirus."" Biden’s plan is part of his push this week to increase his media profile and project leadership as he explains how he’d handle the federal government’s response to the pandemic if he were in the White House.

As the coronavirus continues to tear through the United States, front-line health-care workers are not only in the line of fire, but they are also caught amid growing concern that medical facilities themselves could become hubs for transmission. What's more, global experts worry that the U.S. will soon take the baton from China and Italy, becoming the epicenter for the disease's spread. ""Health-care workers are living in a state of constant anxiety and fear — fear of exposure from sick patients, of getting sick themselves, of accidentally bringing the virus home to loved ones,"" Dr. Summer McGee, dean of the School of Health Sciences at the University of New Haven, told Fox News. ""Every day is filled with compromises, tradeoffs, and life-and-death decisions on a scale and regularity that our health-care system has never seen.""       A U.S. health care worker wearing a homemade mask for protection while working      (Provided to Fox News) Through her lens, one of the biggest concerns now is that health-care professionals ""know they are working in suboptimal and, in some cases, outright unsafe working conditions."" ""Many hospitals are telling workers that you cannot even use masks or other personal protective equipment (PPE) until they have confirmed that a patient has COVID-19, but tests aren't available for COVID-19. These health-care workers are playing Russian roulette with every patient they treat,"" she stressed. ""Having to ration, reuse, or entirely go without proper protective equipment is a major concern. Many health-care organizations have PPE today but only have a two-week supply."" WHY JAPAN APPEARS TO HAVE AVOIDED A MASS CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK In recent weeks, the novel pathogen – which is believed to have originated in a Chinese wet market late last year – has infected more than 64,500 Americans and killed over 900. As of Wednesday afternoon, more than 12 states have reported more than 1,000 cases, with New York registering over 26,400, followed by neighboring New Jersey at 3,675 and California at almost 2,700.       The newly renamed Hotel 166, located near the Northwestern University Hospital complex, in a Monday photo.      (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast) The United States represents 13.5 percent of the world's confirmed cases and some 4.2 percent of its fatalities – a figure that is climbing by the hour. Subsequently, the supply of vital PPE has seemingly not been able to keep up with the escalating demand, given the fast-acting nature of coronavirus, referred to officially as COVID-19. Lawmakers and leaders also worry that a disproportionate infection rate among providers, rendering them ill and unable to work, will have the spiral effect of deepening the already existing calamity. ""Hospitals are already short-staffed as we are in a severe flu season. Long hours, shortage of protective gear, and testing limitation have some fearing that they are flying blind,"" explained Dr. Azadeh Shirazi, a board-certified surgeon, disease specialist and founder of the California-based La Jolla Laser Surgery Center. ""It's a harrowing scene when you are not protecting a limited supply of trained workers. We cannot afford to lose them."" Beyond just the doctors and nurses in medical facilities, overrun and ill-outfitted hospitals as transmission points also threaten other vital services, including security and cleaning personnel. Moreover, the disease has ravished police and firefighting departments nationwide, and scores of EMTs are also grappling with high numbers of diagnoses among the ranks. Fox News interviewed a number of frontline medical workers across the country, who could only speak on the condition of anonymity because they were under strict mandates not to talk to the press about the developing situation.       New York-Presbyterian says visitors will no longer be allowed inside the labor and delivery units during the coronavirus outbreak.      (Google Maps) One Mississippi-based emergency room physician noted that some staff this week have been put on leave after exhibiting symptoms linked to coronavirus, said that in one incidence, five patients from the same family all went into a critical condition – requiring ventilators – after being in close contact with another at a funeral a week prior to becoming ill. ""The public can help us by not exposing themselves or others and practicing social distancing,"" the doctor stressed. The source depicted the emergency room scene in the state as akin to a ""marathon,"" with the number of those requiring ventilators more than half of the confirmed cases, and staff working extended shifts for more than three weeks straight. Dr. Dan Field, chief medical officer at MD Staffers, pointed out that with such demanding hours, many personnel are struggling to obtain safe and adequate child care. ""The best thing everybody can do to help the medical profession as follow the rules set down to flatten the curve by minimizing contact and risk of infection. Only go to the emergency department if you are sicker than a dog and feel like you are heading towards death,"" he said. ""Otherwise, find some way of triaging yourself through telemedicine and similar no-contact communication."" Another New York doctor at a large hospital tending to a number of coronavirus patients early last week lamented that they had fast run out of PPE, and had resorted to reusing n95 masks and even brown paper masks. In another New York hospital, a diagnostic sonographer expressed frustration at a mandate not to wear masks because patients had complained that it gave them anxiety, igniting an extra layer of stress for the workers and their families. Furthermore, many experts fear that – given China's initial smothering of information related to the virus and the incorrect information about its transmission stemming from the World Health Organization (WHO) in the first few critical weeks of the outbreak – the deadly pathogen was swarming unchecked through hospitals and doctor's offices for weeks. While at least 15 states have issued stay-at-home orders and shuttered nonessential businesses, local governments in many other pockets of the country are now being forced to adopt similarly stringent measures including closing public places and restaurants, as well as prohibiting medical procedures and surgeries considered not to be immediately required to ensure as much space and resources in left amid the coronavirus battle. ""We just lost a young nurse in Saint Louis to the Wuhan virus,"" lamented Dr. Scott Magill, executive director of Veterans in Defense of Liberty and former U.S. Army Medical Corps soldier. ""Watching these medical warriors, doctors, nurses and hospital staff, placing themselves and their families in grave danger for the sake of humanity, is emotionally powerful."" And Dr. Josh Luke, a Los Angeles-based hospital CEO – most recently Memorial Hospital of Gardena in Los Angeles County – opined that L.A. county officials and Orange County officials in California have been refusing his help, and has essentially been told, ""We are not set up to bring on individuals. We are relying on the health systems to help with pop-up hospitals and overflow isolation hotels."" As a former hospital CEO and licensed nursing home administrator with significant experience managing ventilator units, Luke noted, the red tape is a restriction at a time of desperate need. He pointed out that doctors are being asked to come out of retirement to help, but the process of streamlining management is ""clearly flawed."" After being turned away by L.A. county officials, Luke said he drove this week to a hotel in Pomona that's being converted to accommodate isolation overflow and was turned away by security. WILL' HERD IMMUNITY' WORK AGAINST CORONAVIRUS? Nonetheless, national data with regards to just how hard health-care personnel have been hit by coronavirus is not yet available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Dr. Attila Hertelendy, a Florida-based expert in biomedicine and emergency and disaster management, also underscored that the usual burden already placed on the medical infrastructure has not suddenly dispersed due to the coronavirus onslaught, either. ""Most of the current challenges in our health-care facilities stem from managing the day to day patients that come to our facilities, these patients that have chronic conditions requiring daily treatment such as dialysis, chemotherapy, etc. They don't go away just because there is a coronavirus pandemic,"" he said. ""Finding ways to continue to provide high-quality care for vulnerable patient groups such as the disabled, elderly remains a challenge as resources are diverted to manage an escalating number of cases daily."" Despite broad criticism over a lack of preparedness for such a public health crisis, a late 2019 assessment by the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) and the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security (JHCHS) ranked the United States as the best-prepared country in the world to handle a pandemic. President Trump this week acknowledged that the pandemic is likely to worsen but has assured workers that federal authorities are addressing concerns surrounding specialized masks and surgical gowns, with shipments on their way. On Wednesday, Trump affirmed that FEMA was distributing 8 million medical masks and 14 million surgical masks.

The unrest swirls amid veiled threats from the Communist leadership that supplies would be withheld should they be saddled with coronavirus blame. Moreover, the sudden onslaught of the coronavirus has also illuminated the ingenuity and selflessness of the many American individuals and private companies. According to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, more than 40,000 health-care professionals have signed on as volunteers to offer assistance in New York alone – some 6,000 of them in the realm of mental health care to provide free online services to those in need.       A large tent set up in front of the emergency room at EvergreenHealth Medical Center in Kirkland, Wash., last week.      (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren) Other non-traditional businesses – from car and electronic manufacturers to small apparel companies – have also taken to making such crucial medical supplies, including respirators, ventilators, masks, and gowns. Companies developing at-home testing kits have over the past week even reversed course and opted to send their technologies instead to medical facilities as the first priority.

""Once our ventilator and ICU capacity has run out, doctors and administrators must be prepared for how they will make rationing decisions, on the ground and in real-time, of who will get lifesaving care and who will not,"" McGee added.

Trump for President, Inc. will have no choice but to pursue all legal remedies available to it in law and in equity; we will not stand idly by and allow you to broadcast false, deceptive, and misleading information concerning President’s Trump’s healthcare positions without consequence,"" read the letters, signed by campaign attorney Alex W. Cannon. According to the campaign, the local stations bore unique responsibility since they weren't required to broadcast PUSA's ad like they are with ads paid for by candidate committees. ""PUSA’s advertisement is false, misleading, and deceptive, and we formally demand that your station refuse to continue airing it to meet your responsibilities not to broadcast false information,"" the letter read, ""Unlike candidate committees, PUSA does not have a 'right to command the use of broadcast facilities.'"" The campaign further warned that failure to remove the ad could put stations' licenses in jeopardy. Trump's team previously asked Twitter to flag a nearly identical ad to Priorities USA's, but the social media giant refused. ""Fellow Americans,"" a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, ran the ad but it's unclear where the group originated. Its website is relatively sparse and vaguely refers to opposing political division in the United States.  Both ads splice together Trump's statements while displaying a chart that shows the increasing number of coronavirus cases in the United States. LATEST ANTI-TRUMP AD PASSES TWITTER SCRUTINY AS DARK MONEY TARGETS PANDEMIC RESPONSE PUSA's ad followed those from other Democrat-aligned groups who sought to criticize Trump's coronavirus response. A PAC tied to former Obama aide David Plouffe is also planning to spend millions in attack ads targeting several key swing states. Americans for Public Trust, an outside group led by former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt, a Republican, is claiming that similar anti-Trump messaging is coming from a series of organizations tied to Arabella Advisors -- a dark money nonprofit providing help to liberal groups. Specifically, it manages the New Venture Fund (NVF) and  Sixteen Thirty Fund, both of which have supported another Democrat-aligned group -- American Bridge -- that's hitting Trump on the coronavirus response. The New Venture Fund has also supported Acronym, the nonprofit led by Plouffe. New Venture Fund previously distanced itself from Pacronym, telling Fox News it had ""nothing to do"" with the group's ad. Guy Cecil, a former adviser to Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign, leads PUSA, which was created by former campaign officials for Barack Obama. The group also has received funding from liberal billionaire George Soros. JOE BIDEN SAYS TRUMP NEEDED TO MOVE FASTER ON CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE Other former advisers to top Democrats have also started a ""coronavirus war room"" at Protect Our Care, an organization which as been described as a project of the Sixteen Thirty Fund. According to the group's director, the war room was designed to hold Trump ""accountable for his failure to lead"" during the pandemic. Heading the war room is Zac Petkanas, a former adviser to Hillary Clinton and former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Sarah Chase, a former research associate for the presidential campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., is joining the team as well. Fox News previously reported on how multiple media outlets omitted context surrounding Trump's comments to his rally audience in February.

""One of my people came up to me and said, 'Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia, that didn't work out too well. They couldn't do it.

As governors across the country lock down their states and permit only businesses that are deemed essential for people’s health and well-being to remain open during the coronavirus pandemic, many are asking what constitutes an “essential business.” Grocery stores, pharmacies, banks and gas stations are obvious answers, but there is one industry that has divided local officials – and citizens – over whether it is really an essential business: gun stores. With firearms and ammunition retailers from New York to California reporting record sales over the last few weeks, state governors are deciding whether to allow dealers to keep their doors open or not. As of Thursday, seven states in total – Delaware, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York and Washington -- have issued orders for gun dealers to close up shop for the foreseeable future, while 17 others have explicitly allowed them to stay open, albeit in some cases with customer and operating restrictions. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW “What we don’t want to have happen are these kind of panic purchases like we’re seeing right now with first-time buyers,” Kris Brown, the president of the Brady Campaign, told Fox News. “We’ll get a vaccine for the coronavirus and this will all pass, but these guns will be still be in people’s homes.” The remaining states have either not yet issued any orders regarding gun stores or have left the decision up to county officials or local law enforcement. The shuttering of guns stores under lockdown orders has already led to widespread complaints – and in some cases legal action – by Second Amendment rights groups across the country. “Some anti-gun lawmakers are exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic to deny you and your loved ones your fundamental right to self-defense and your Second Amendment rights,” the National Rifle Association said in a note to its members. “These anti-gun and anti-self defense extremists deem gun stores ‘non-essential,’ they shut down issuance of firearm permits, and, in some locations, they have created extreme delays for background checks required for firearm transfers.” In New Jersey, the lockdown order issued by Gov. Phil Murphy included licensed firearms dealers as “non-essential retail businesses” and directed them to close to the public. The state also shut down new submissions to its background check system, which effectively put any new gun sale in the state on hold. DO YOU QUALIFY FOR A STIMULUS CHECK IN THE SENATE'S CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE BILL Murphy’s order has led a gun shop in the state along with the pro-gun Second Amendment Foundation to file a lawsuit in federal court -- arguing that the order violates the constitutional right to bear arms. “Of all the states that have put a ban on gun sales, New Jersey is far and away the worst,” Second Amendment Foundation executive vice president Alan Gottlieb told Fox News. “In New Jersey, they’ve not only shut down gun stores, they’ve also shut down the state’s database to do background checks so it’s basically an absolute ban on the sale on firearms in the state of New Jersey.” In neighboring Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Wolf reversed his previous order to close gun shops, allowing dealers to open their doors on a limited basis during the coronavirus pandemic after several justices of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court urged him to do so. Firearms dealers may now sell their wares by individual appointment during limited hours as long as they comply with social distancing guidelines and take other measures to protect employees and customers from the coronavirus, the governor's office said. Wolf's office did not announce the policy change. It was included on an updated list of businesses that are subject to his order to close their physical locations because they have been deemed “non-life-sustaining.” Gun rights advocates hailed the decision to allow gun shops to reopen. “I am extremely pleased that Governor Wolf has acknowledged that he may not eviscerated citizens’ inviolate rights, regardless of any states of emergency that may exist,” said Joshua Prince, who had filed suit on behalf of a gun shop and a would-be gun purchaser. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court had narrowly dismissed Prince's suit, which challenged Wolf’s authority to shutter businesses deemed “non-life-sustaining,” but in a dissenting statement joined by two other justices, Justice David Wecht said Wolf’s order amounts to “an absolute and indefinite prohibition upon the acquisition of firearms by the citizens of this commonwealth — a result in clear tension with the Second Amendment” and the state constitution. PENCE SAYS WHITE HOUSE NOT CONSIDERING A NATIONWIDE CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWN While the gun control debate generally falls along party lines, the coronavirus pandemic has usurped the normal order. Liberal Democrat lawmakers, like Wolf and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker are permitting gun stores to remain open as essential businesses, while Republicans like Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker have ordered them closes. Then there is California where Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, has deferred to each county's sheriff’s office to determine whether or not to order gun stores closed. “I believe in people’s right to bear arms but I’ll defer to the sheriff in this instance, the sheriffs in their respective jurisdictions,” said Newsom during a press conference on Wednesday. In the Northern California counties of Alameda, Contra Costa, Santa Clara, San Mateo, San Francisco, and Marin guns stores were deemed “nonessential” and ordered to close – although there have been reports that some remain open or are allowing customers to pick up weapons that had already been ordered. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In rural Kern County, gun shops have been allowed to remain open with stores reporting record sales amid the coronavirus crisis. “We have had a line out people out the door,” Berge K., an employee at Valley Guns Inc. in Bakersfield, told Fox News. “It’s mostly people buying self-defense shotguns and handguns, and most are first-time buyers.” In Los Angeles County – the country’s most populous -- Sheriff Alex Villanueva reversed on Wednesday his previous order to close gun shops, saying in a tweet that “LA County Sheriff’s Dept. Enforcement efforts to close non-essential businesses have been suspended.” Villanueva had previously said a “loophole” had allowed stores to stay open, but it was meant to keep open only gun and ammunition businesses that support police departments and other security organizations. In an interview with Fox11, Villanueva said the decision to reverse course came after “the county’s top lawyer put out a legal opinion that she believes gun stores are essential businesses and should remain open.” The Associated Press contributed to this report.

EXCLUSIVE: Attorney General William Barr on Thursday denied reports that the Department of Justice is seeking new emergency powers for itself amid the coronavirus outbreak that would suspend certain rights in criminal matters and potentially detain people indefinitely without trial, saying, “It's cockamamie nonsense.” ""It's a gross mischaracterization,"" Barr told Fox News during a telephone interview.

SENATE PASSES $2T STIMULUS BILL BY UNANIMOUS CONSENT AMID COVID-19 PANDEMIC The Labor Department said Thursday that the new number eclipsed the previous record of 695,000, which was set in 1982, and is well above the levels seen during the 2008 financial crisis. But the White House said Thursday that the latest numbers are no surprise, amid the Trump administration’s coronavirus strategy. “This is to be totally expected because the whole strategy of President Trump is to basically get social distancing so that we can combat the virus and put public health above economics in the very, very short run, so this is no surprise,” White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said on “America’s Newsroom” Thursday. “We should accept the news because we’re doing what we need to do to combat the virus,” he continued, adding that the more than $2 trillion stimulus package awaiting approval by the House of Representatives outlines “targeted relief, particularly for low-income workers” and “targeted industry relief.” US UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS SHATTER RECORD AS COVID-19 HAMMERS ECONOMY “Nobody understands the pain more than this White House,” Navarro said of the American workers who have lost their jobs due to the spread of COVID-19. “We are attuned to their plight and we’re going to try to get them that cash cushion as soon as possible, the loan window open for small businesses … what we’ve been waiting for is Congress to do their thing.” He added: “President Trump and his team are doing everything we possibly can to deal both with public health emergency and the economic crisis.” White House spokesman Judd Deere also weighed in, saying that ""Americans are making enormous sacrifices and he is grateful for their spirit."" ""The large increase in unemployment claims is just one of the many reasons why President Trump committed weeks ago to take care of all Americans, including affected industries and small businesses, so that we emerge from this challenge stronger and with a prosperous and growing economy,"" Deere said in a statement to Fox News. Navarro and Deere's comments come after Trump, during a Fox News virtual town hall on Monday, said he “would love to have the country opened up” by Easter, which falls on April 12 this year. The president has argued that he doesn’t want “to turn the country off” and see a continued economic downfall from the coronavirus pandemic. He also said he worries that the country will see “suicides by the thousands” if the novel coronavirus devastates the economy. “We lose thousands and thousands of people a year to the flu. We don’t turn the country off,” Trump said during the town hall. “We lose much more than that to automobile accidents. We don’t call up the automobile companies and say stop making cars.” He added: “We have to get back to work.” White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham appeared to soften the president’s message Tuesday, after harsh criticism from state officials, medical professionals and the media, saying that she thinks Trump “would love it if we were open up for business yesterday.” “After the 15 days, when we see the data come in, we’ll see where we’re at and I think the president will make his decision,” Grisham said on “Fox & Friends.” “But he is hopeful.” The White House, earlier this month, implemented a policy called “15 days to slow the spread,” which included social distancing, working from home when possible, and avoiding gatherings of more than 10 people in order to curb the spread of COVID-19. Many states have forced non-essential businesses to close during the pandemic. Meanwhile, Coronavirus Task Force member Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Health, said on ""The Ingraham Angle"" Wednesday that the president's Easter timeline is ""aspirational."" Fauci added: ""He's been very flexible about it, even though it looks like he's made this absolute decision on something. He does have an open mind about it."" Meanwhile, the Senate late Wednesday passed a massive $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package, ending days of deadlock. The bill was sent to the House, where Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., will soon take up the historic measure to bring relief to individuals, small businesses, and larger corporations. The package would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of up to $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year, and $2,400 to married couples making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child. After a $75,000 threshold for individuals, the benefit would be reduced by $5 for each $100 the taxpayer makes. A similar $150,000 threshold applies to couples, and a $112,500 threshold for heads of households. The legislation passed by the Senate will use 2019 tax returns, if available, or 2018 tax returns to assess income for determining how much direct financial aid individuals receive. Those who did not file tax returns can use a Form SSA-1099, Social Security Benefit Statement or Form RRB-1099, a Social Security Equivalent Benefit Statement, per page 149 of the bill. Further, the bill allocates $250 billion to extend unemployment insurance to more workers, and lengthen the duration to 39 weeks, up from the normal 26 weeks -- $600 extra a week would be provided for four months. The final package would additionally provide $349 billion in loans to small businesses -- and money spent on rent, payroll and utilities become grants that don't need to be paid back. Many hotels would qualify as small businesses under the plan. The House is slated to take up the measure for a final vote on Friday.

President Trump announced he will be traveling on Saturday to Norfolk, Va., to send off a Navy hospital ship headed to the New York City Harbor to help hospitals in the country’s largest city deal with the crush of patients amid the coronavirus pandemic. The USNS Comfort is slated to depart from Naval Station Norfolk this weekend after undergoing a speedy maintenance – three weeks ahead of schedule – and arrive in New York at Pier 90 on Monday. “I’ll kiss it goodbye,” Trump said Thursday during a press briefing from the White House coronavirus task force.  WHITE HOUSE SAYS RECORD SURGE IN UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS 'NO SURPRISE' AMID CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE  The Comfort – a 1,000 bed medical ship – is heading to New York to aid hospitals throughout the New York metropolitan region as they deal with a surge of patients dealing with the coronavirus. The naval ship will not treat patients suffering from COVID-19, but instead will serve as a referral hospital for non-COVID-19 patients currently admitted to shore-based hospitals. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has warned that the virus is putting major stress on New York state hospitals, and that the state’s hospital system only has 53,000 beds. For days, state and federal officials have weighed how to create additional space for the expected influx of patients in the coming days and weeks due to the virus. ""We are waging war on this virus using every financial, scientific, medical, pharmaceutical, and military resource to halt its spread and protect our citizens,” Trump said on Thursday. The Comfort was in port in Norfolk undergoing repairs after a six-month tour in South America and was slated to be ready to arrive in New York until ""mid April"" at the earliest. But top Pentagon officials said they expedited measures to ready the vessel. New York is currently the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S., with more than 33,000 confirmed cases in the state and another 4,400 in nearby New Jersey. The top response coordinator for the White House’s coronavirus task force, Dr. Deborah Birx, warned New Yorkers earlier this week that they should isolate themselves from others if they have left the city for an area with fewer infections. Her message was reiterated by Vice President Mike Pence, who said the federal government is dealing with New York as “a high-risk area” and will continue to surge resources to the region. Pence said that public health officials are seeing one infection for every 1,000 people in the New York area compared to 0.1 or 0.2 per 1,000 people in places like Washington state – where the first major outbreak occurred in the U.S. “Take the guidelines that we’ve issued and avoid nonessential travel,” Pence added.

The Mercy originally was set to head to Seattle before receiving orders to go to Los Angeles instead. California Gov.

Steve Daines, R-Montana, and his staff have facilitated numerous emergency repatriation flights for U.S. citizens trapped abroad amid the growing coronavirus pandemic -- including a last-minute escape from Africa that highlights the risks for the thousands of Americans still stuck away from home, Fox News has learned. The pandemic has infected more than 400,000 people around the world and killed over 20,000. International lockdowns have led stranded travelers to reach out to lawmakers to cut through bureaucratic red tape, often with just minutes to spare. Pastor Mark Arbaugh, who had been stuck in Lima, Peru, told Fox News early Friday morning that he was one of those fortunate escapees in large part because of his hometown senator. ""Senator Daines' office was very helpful to us,"" Arbaugh said in a text message to Fox News while onboard his red-eye repatriation flight into Washington, D.C. He was traveling with several Montana Tech students.

Wally worked hard at making sure that my group of 4 and our new friends that were stranded from Atlanta in the same hotel with us got on the same manifest,"" Arbaugh added. Arbaugh said he had never met Daines or anyone in his office before, but worked closely with them during the ordeal. As for the situation in Peru, Arbaugh observed that ""a lot of people are gonna have a tough time getting out"" now that the national quarantine there has been extended to April 12. But, Arbaugh said, he was looking forward to returning to the country when the situation stabilizes. Meanwhile, Isaac Sturgeon, 31, told Fox News that his return to the U.S. on Saturday night from Morocco came as military vehicles were preparing to enforce a strict curfew and shut down international travel indefinitely because of the virus. ""I just wanted to be back on American soil,"" Sturgeon told Fox News, who was traveling for skydiving instruction. ""I registered with the embassy ... There was a lot of silence for a couple days; I don't think they were use to this kind of high volume of phone calls and people at the gates."" WATCH BELOW: VIDEO FROM STURGEON'S FLIGHT HOME That's when Sturgeon said his father ""decided to try to get a hold of Steve Daines directly."" Afterward, Sturgeon said, things moved quickly. Daines' office contacted the State Department to charter a flight for Americans when commercial flights were canceled. Once that was approved, Daines made the request to reserve a seat for Isaac. ""I'm sure all the pressure helped a lot,"" Sturgeon said, referring to the senator's outreach. Ahead of the flight, the U.S. embassy ""emailed me and said get to the airport between 12:30 to 5:30, flights were leaving; go to front counter and show them your passport and they'll assign you a seat on one of those airplanes,"" Sturgeon said.

Strugeon received what he called ""wonderful"" help not only from Daines and his staff -- ""Liz was great,"" and Daines himself was ""kind and humble,"" he said -- but also from British Airways, who flew him from Marrakesh to London. ""I commend them,"" Sturgeon said of the British Airways crew. ""Excellent spirit, people and staff on the airplane. There were about 150 Americans on the plane. The airline staff said they didn't know they were coming to get us until 5 a.m. that morning. Great spirit, complimentary snacks."" For those still stuck abroad, Strugeon had some advice: ""You've got to get on the horn, talk to people, be sociable to find out what the word is."" ""Especially in a foreign country you have to take matters into your own hands, be hyperproductive and find out what's going on,"" he continued. ""You have to care for your own life in a crisis; even in America you have to have common sense -- not everyone can help you. The government can't always be there for just you -- - you're not as special as you think. There's 350 million Americans our government has to take care of.""

At the same time, he said he benefited tremendously throughout the ordeal by linking up with another American from Colorado and joining a Facebook group full of other U.S. citizens in Africa. In an Instagram post, Strugeon sounded a celebratory note in mid-air: ""After an Evac flight out of North Africa 48 hours before boder closings, ...... im Home.

Daines' office is additionally working to secure the release of other Americans abroad, including Necia Erickson in Cusco, Peru, and a slew of students in Huanchaco, Peru. “I’m so glad to hear that Pastor Mark and the Montana Tech students will be returning to Montana today and I wish them safe travels as they make it home,"" Daines told Fox News. He added that he was happy to have ""helped Isaac return to the U.S. from being stuck abroad during this time."" ""I wish Isaac and his family well, and look forward to hearing about their reunion. Welcome home, Isaac!” Daines said. ""I continue to work around the clock to bring other Montanans home stuck abroad.” Peru has posed numerous high-profile challenges for Americans abroad. In one extreme case, a 33-year-old American woman running out of her life-saving medication to treat her auto-immune disease finally boarded a flight home Wednesday after being stuck in Peru for about 10 days, but hundreds of other U.S. citizens remained stranded after the South American nation closed its borders due to the coronavirus pandemic.

"                          CPA Gene Marks breaks down the $2 trillion stimulus deal. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. Furious lawmakers voiced serious concerns on Capitol Hill late Thursday that a Republican House member could “go rogue” and possibly scuttle a vote on the $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package, and potentially endanger other House members in the process, Fox News has learned. Fox News is told there is deep worry on both sides of the aisle that Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., could try to sidetrack House plans to quickly approve the coronavirus bill via a “voice vote” -- a verbal exercise in which those in favor shout yea, and those opposed holler nay. The loudest side would prevail. “It’s the Thomas Massie show,” said one senior Republican source who asked to not be identified. “He is going to do it,” a senior Republican leadership source told Fox News, explaining that leadership had tried every type of arm twisting -- and it's not working. The source said he was actively calling members and telling them to get on planes in the morning to come back to Washington, so that a quorum of 216 members could be established if Massie or another member were to demand one. The source explained that Massie got a very forceful call from a close confidant and member of the House Freedom Caucus urging him to allow the voice vote, but Massie won’t budge. “We have been riding [House Speaker Nancy] Pelosi for stalling things, and now this,” the source lamented. Asked whether the House leadership was concerned about others besides Massie, another source replied, “There are others who are egging him on.” “He had better not do that!” screamed one livid senior House Democratic aide into the phone when asked about such a scenario and Massie. “He’s going to make everyone in the building get [coronavirus].” A senior administration source declined to comment to Fox News when asked if the Trump administration made efforts to curb any potential parliamentary mischief by Massie. “A lot of members are pi--ed off,” one source said. “If we don’t have a quorum on tomorrow, we’ll definitely have one by Saturday.” The 880-page coronavirus stimulus package would amount to the largest economic relief bill in the history of the U.S. for individuals, large corporations, and small businesses -- and its unanimous passage in the Senate came despite grave concerns on both sides about whether it involved too much spending, or not enough. Massie did not respond to multiple requests for comment from Fox News late Thursday. It was unclear exactly why he may want to delay the bill, which some lawmakers have said contains too much wasteful spending -- including $25 million for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C.       Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., seen here in 2015, did not immediately comment. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call, File)       Amid the confusion, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., distributed a floor schedule late Thursday saying the House will convene at 9 a.m. ET Friday, and there will be two hours of debate. ""Members are advised that it is possible this measure will not pass by voice vote,"" the schedule reads. ""Members are encouraged to follow the guidance of their local and state health officials, however if they are able and willing to be in Washington D.C. by 10:00 a.m. tomorrow, Members are encouraged to do so with caution,"" Hoyer's schedule continues. “You might have one grandstander,” President Trump warned at a coronavirus press conference earlier in the day. “It will pass. It will just take a little longer."" Also in the evening Thursday, Fox News spoke to a Republican member who was returning to Washington due to the potential Massie situation. The member expressed shock that there could be delays given that the Senate passed the stimulus bill by a 96-0 unanimous vote. “I’m coming to D.C. to ensure the bill passes,” the GOP member told Fox News. “It’s frustrating having to be prepared for this scenario. ... I really wish members would put people first and just get this done. Heck, if 100 percent of senators can agree, it’s pretty clear this is going to pass. Only thing a member would be doing is holding it up at great risk to the American people. It’s very troublesome a member of Congress would engage in such a tactic.” THE CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL: LOANS, CHECKS, 'PORK' & MORE Top Democrats and Republicans have indicated they’d prefer a voice vote because it would not require as many members to return to the Capitol, and would speed a vote along. However, after the voice vote, any member simply may call for “a recorded vote.” That automatically would trigger the roll call. That’s where House members insert cards into electronic voting machines and vote either yes, no or present. The House then documents and records the ballot of each member. ""A lot of members are pi--ed off."" In the event a roll-call vote were to be needed because Massie demands one, leadership could push to delay the vote until Saturday to give members time to travel back to D.C., according to the two congressional sources. The plan for a roll-call vote is to divide the members into 16 groups of 30 members apiece to file into the chamber “to minimize the risks posed by placing too many individuals in one location,” according to an internal security memo obtained by Fox News. READ THE FULL SECURITY MEMO A ""State of the Union""-style extreme posture will be in effect on Capitol Hill on Friday, according to the memo, sent by Capitol Attending Physician Dr. Brian Monahan and House Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving to all House members ahead of Friday's coronavirus vote. “A recorded vote could take five or six hours,” even once all necessary members are back in Washington, one House aide complained. That’s because the House would stretch out the vote, according to the memo, having only members enter the chamber to vote in small clusters to contain the coronavirus risk. Most votes in the House have taken about 20 or so minutes. Votes are sometimes reduced to five or even two minutes if everyone is in the chamber. (The longest vote in House history came on Nov. 23, 2003, and ran 2 hours and 55 minutes. It started at 3 a.m. ET and ended just before 6 a.m. ET on a measure to expand Medicare.) There could be a deeper problem than the logistics of taking a roll call vote, however. Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution notes that the House and Senate need “a Majority of each shall constitue a Quorum to do Business.” Massie or any other member could make a point of order -- in which a member asserts that the House or Senate is not operating properly under its own rules -- that the House doesn’t have a quroum. Therefore, the House can't vote if it lacks a quorum. With 430 members, 216 constitutes a quorum. House Rule XX dictates parameters for establishing quorums in the House of Representatives. Rule XX, Clause 5 (c)(1) deals with the House reducing the number required for a quorum “due to catastrophic circumstances.” But, that rule would eventually trigger the House declaring a number of seats vacant over a period of days, and therefore isn't an option. In short, the House may have the votes by just a simple majority to pass the coronavirus bill. But if someone makes a point of order about the House lacking a quorum, then leaders will likely have to rustle up 216 members – be that Friday, over the weekend or next week – before the House could vote on the coronavirus bill. On a conference call with Democrats today, Pelosi, D-Calif., told members the House will vote Friday “if there’s a quorum tomorrow.” Separately, the security memo also indicated that limited personnel with no extra aides will be permitted at the Capitol. Only one or two persons will be allowed in the elevators at a time, and most will be encouraged to use the stairs, according to the memo. ""Access will be strictly limited to members of Congress, congressional staff who have an office located inside the Capitol and staff who have designated floor access. If a staff person does not have a Capitol office -- even if accompanied by a member -- they will not be permitted inside the Capitol,"" the memo stated. ""Credentialed press will be permitted, as will official business visitors to the House wing."" The document called for members to remain in their offices until voting. The officials are discouraging those “who are ill with respiratory symptoms or fever” from attending. WHO QUALIFIES FOR A CHECK? Officials also are expected to eliminate two of the six lecterns in the House chamber from which members may speak. The officials are asking members to keep away from each other inside the House chamber, and to clean the lectern themselves after they speak. On a GOP call Thursday afternoon, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., informed Republicans that a GOP member was threatening to request a recorded vote, according to one Republican on the call. The member wasn’t identified. Democrats are united in favor of a voice vote on the legislation Friday and there was no talk on a caucus call Thursday afternoon that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., or any other Democrat would try to gum up the process and force a recorded vote, according to a source familiar with the call. Behind the scenes, Capitol attending physicians, as well as party leaders in the House, have been working to discourage members from coming back to Washington to vote on the package, Fox News has learned. The not-so-subtle messaging, intended to avoid the unnecessary spread of the contagion, came as the House closed the gym normally available to members. “That’s to make it as uncomfortable as possible on them,” one source who asked not to be identified told Fox News. “Some of these members practically live out of the gym.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “Having all of these guys on planes, flying in and then going back spells trouble,” another senior source said. Fox News is told both sides have been trying to get a head count of how many members may actually show up. One source ventured a guess that it could range from “70 to 150.” Fox News' Leland Vittert contributed to this report.

"                          Dr. Anthony Fauci says the White House Coronavirus Task Force is working around the clock to fight the coronavirus outbreak on 'Life, Liberty &amp; Levin.' Here are eight takeaways on the coronavirus pandemic from a Fox News Poll released Thursday. -- President Trump’s overall job approval ticks up, while large numbers of Democrats and Republicans approve of infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci. -- Equal numbers of voters, 9 in 10, are concerned about the spread of coronavirus in the U.S. and that the virus will cause a recession. -- More than 4 in 10 say someone in their household lost their job or work hours because of the virus. -- The number of Republicans feeling “nervous” about the economy is up 26 points. -- Voters split over whether Trump’s response to the outbreak is appropriate, while one quarter feel most Americans are “overreacting.” -- When asked about Uncle Sam’s ability to check Mother Nature, more blame the government for the virus spreading the way it has than say it was unstoppable. -- Most voters say their daily life has changed because of coronavirus, and large numbers are praying for health, avoiding public places, and washing their hands. -- More Democrats than Republicans are concerned about the virus spreading nationally and about personally catching it. CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS Here are the numbers behind those findings: Approval of Trump’s overall job performance is up one point since February to 48 percent, while 51 percent disapprove. That puts him underwater by 3 points. Last month, his rating was 47 approve-52 disapprove (-5).  His best marks were in February 2017, when he had a net positive rating by one point (48-47). The uptick comes from a record 16 percent of Democrats approving of Trump, up from a previous high of 14 percent. And approval among women matches an earlier record 43 percent. When asked specifically about responses to the coronavirus outbreak, 51 percent of voters approve of Trump and 46 percent disapprove.  The federal government overall (55-41) and Vice President Mike Pence (55-37) receive similar ratings. A much larger number, 77 percent, approve of the job Dr. Anthony Fauci is doing (12 percent disapprove).  There is rare partisan agreement on Fauci, as most Democrats (74 percent) and Republicans (85 percent) approve, while ratings on Trump, Pence, and the federal government are highly partisan. Fully 89 percent are very or somewhat concerned the pandemic will cause a recession and 77 percent fear it will cause financial hardship for their family.  Nearly as many worry about their ability to access needed health care services (74 percent) and get tested for the virus (70 percent). One in eight (12 percent) say they know someone who has the virus, while seven in ten (69 percent) are worried they will catch it.  Ninety-two percent are concerned about it spreading in the U.S., up from 70 percent last month.  For comparison, concern about Ebola virus spreading peaked at 68 percent (2014) and 65 percent for swine flu (2009). Overall, voters have mixed views on whether Trump is reacting appropriately to the outbreak (45 percent) or not taking it seriously enough (46 percent).  Few feel he is overreacting (7 percent). Here’s a hint at whether voters will blame Washington.  By a 53-34 percent margin, more believe a quicker response from the federal government could have slowed the spread of coronavirus in the U.S. than say it is so contagious that nothing could have prevented it spreading the way it has.  Some 30 percent of Republicans join 73 percent of Democrats in saying the government could have made a difference had it acted faster. Half or fewer rate the government’s response as “excellent” or “good” on giving clear information (50 percent), preventing the spread (48 percent), responding quickly (45 percent), and reducing economic harm (44 percent). Voters are feeling economic jitters.  Forty-three percent say someone in their household lost their job or had work hours cut because of the virus.  The number rating the economy positively is down 22 points since January, those expecting the economy to get worse next year is up 15 points, and the number saying they are “nervous” about the economy is nearing the record high. Economic nervousness hit a high of 70 percent in 2010.  Today, 62 percent are nervous, up from 48 percent in September 2019 (the most recent comparison).  The shift comes mostly from a 26-point increase among Republicans, as 45 percent feel uneasy compared to 19 percent six months ago. Among Democrats, “nervous” increased by 7 points (77 up from 70 percent). In addition, since January, the portion of Republicans saying the economy is in excellent or good shape dropped 34 points (85 vs. 51 percent) compared to a 12-point decline among Democrats (31 vs. 19 percent). Overall, 33 percent of voters rate the economy positively, down from 55 percent in January.  A plurality of 40 percent thinks the economy will get worse next year, up from 25 percent a year ago (April 2019). Some 85 percent have changed the way they lead their everyday life because of the virus, including 50 percent who say “a great deal” of change. For nearly 200 million Americans, one of the biggest changes is staying home as much as possible.  More than 20 states have shelter-in-place-type orders, and 75 percent of voters favor a national “stay-in-place” order for everyone except essential workers. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Majorities report that in the last week they are washing their hands more often (88 percent), avoiding public places (82 percent), praying for health and healing (70 percent), stocking up on food/supplies (61 percent), and changing travel plans (59 percent). Some might consider those actions over the top.  Twenty-four percent of voters say Americans are overreacting to the outbreak, while the rest split between thinking Americans are reacting appropriately (36 percent) and not taking it seriously enough (37 percent). By a 14-point margin, Republicans are more likely than Democrats to think Americans are overreacting, and Republicans are less likely to have changed their life “a great deal” (-13), be worried about getting infected (-14), and be concerned about the virus spreading nationally (-7). As lawmakers vote on an emergency major stimulus bill, more than 8 in 10 voters favor writing checks for middle- and lower-income Americans and giving cash to small businesses, but support drops to about 3 in 10 for giveaways to major corporations. Approval of Congress stands at 31 percent. That’s up from 26 percent last month and the highest it has been since February 2011. Conducted March 21-24, 2020 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,011 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones.  The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters.

The Department of Homeland Security announced Thursday it would be delaying the deadline for Americans to apply and receive a Real ID -- a driver's license or identification card with a gold star in the top right corner -- due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Trump administration decided on a 12-month delay extending the deadline to get a Real ID until October 1, 2021, after Departments of Motor Vehicles across the nation were forced to close as state officials took precautions to stop the spread of COVID-19, including shutting crowded places. ACTING DHS SECRETARY WOLF: NO 'IMMEDIATE' PLANS FOR DOMESTIC TRAVEL BAN AMID CORONAVIRUS ""States across the country are temporarily closing or restricting access to DMVs. This action will preclude millions of people from applying for and receiving their REAL ID,"" Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf said in a statement on Twitter. The Real ID Act was passed by Congress in 2005 in an effort to establish minimum security standards for state-issued driver’s licenses and identification cards. The Act also prohibits federal agencies from accepting licenses and identification cards from states that do not meet these standards for official purposes such as air travel. The Act was aimed at tightening security measures to obtain an ID post 9/11, requiring DMVs to ask for more paperwork to prove residency and social security numbers than would have otherwise have been required for a standard license. ""Extending the deadline will also allow @DHSgov to work with Congress to implement needed changes to expedite the issuance of REAL IDs once the current health crisis concludes,"" Wolf said.

President Trump said at a briefing Thursday he may stop referring to coronavirus as “Chinese virus” if it bothered the Chinese community. Although he said he would consider nixing the term, he didn’t think there was anything wrong with it. Trump began calling COVID-19 “Chinese Virus” soon after rumors began circulating among Chinese officials that coronavirus found its origin in the U.S. Army, and he rejected objections from the media that the term might be “racist.” However, he said that if China continues to protest the name he might stop using it. “If you look at Ebola, right, if you look at Lyme in Connecticut, you look at all these different horrible diseases, they seem to come with a name with a location,” he said. “I don’t have to say it if they feel so strongly about it, we’ll see.” CHINA TEMPORARILY BARS ENTRY FROM FOREIGN VISITORS AMID CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC President Trump told reporters that he had a call scheduled with Chinese leader Xi Jinping Thursday night, which he said would be a “fruitful call.” Trump banned travel from China in late January to slow the spread of the virus.

Attorney General William Barr instructed the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to move nonviolent inmates who are at risk of contracting the coronavirus out of prison facilities and allow them to serve out their sentences in home confinement.

Criminals who have committed violent crimes or sexual offenses are not eligible for home confinement. The BOP medical director has been instructed to assess an inmate's risk factor in contracting COVID-19, including coronavirus exposures at the particular prison facility as well as the individual inmate's health history and age. Inmates who are granted home confinement will have to be quarantined for 14-days before they are discharged from the prison in an effort to protect the public.

"                          As the COVID-19 pandemic is forcing Americans to shelter at home amid an election year, the government is ready to help states beef up mail-in voting with additional funds. Check out how the coronavirus stimulus package is set to make voting safer for all. While more than 10 states with upcoming presidential nominating contests have postponed their elections due to the coronavirus outbreak, three states scheduled to hold primaries and caucuses on April 4 are not delaying the dates of their contests. But the states – Alaska, Hawaii and Wyoming -- will not allow any in-person casting of ballots and instead will be 100 percent vote by mail. Hawaii Democrats had always expected that most of the voting in its party-run presidential primary would be by mail. Now that’s the only option. The state party recently announced that it has nixed plans for in-person voting at 21 polling sites across Hawaii. The party had already mailed out two rounds of ballots and will now put out a third round as well. They also pushed back the deadline to register to vote in the primary to April 4. The party stressed, “Safety comes first during this challenging time.” Hawaii Democrats says it won’t have primary results until May. The Alaska Democratic Party – which, like Hawaii, is holding a party-run presidential primary – also scrapped its April 4 in-person voting. The party extended the date a mailed-in ballot needed to be postmarked from March 24 to April 10. Ballots had already been mailed to all Alaska Democrats but the party now says ballots can also bet downloaded from its website. The Wyoming Democratic Party’s presidential caucus will also be mail-in only, after they removed the option for people to vote in person. People who registered too late to receive a ballot in the mail will now be mailed a ballot. The deadline to request a replacement ballot has been pushed back to March 31. The party also moved the date by which ballots must be received from April 4 to April 17. Pennsylvania's change Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf’s expected to sign a bill pushing back his state’s presidential primary from April 28 to June 2. Meeting remotely for the first time in history, the state’s Republican-controlled legislature on Wednesday voted to delay the date of the primary. A bill passed last year in Pennsylvania gave all voters the ability to vote by mail. With 186 Democratic convention delegates up for grabs, Pennsylvania’s the second-largest remaining primary, following New York State. Ohio extends mail-in deadline Ohio lawmakers moved to extend the deadline for mailed-in ballots in that state’s presidential primary through April 28. The Ohio primary was originally scheduled for March 17, but on the eve of the contest, Gov. Mike DeWine said it wasn’t safe for voters to head to the polls. While the governor didn’t have the unilateral power to delay the election, the state’s top health official ordered polling places closed without officially moving the date of the primary. Under a bill passed by the legislature Wednesday – which DeWine is expected to sign – postcards will be sent to every registered voter to explain how they can obtain an absentee ballot. Ballots must be postmarked by April 27 and received by May 8 to be counted. The state will allow an extremely limited group of people – mostly disabled voters – to cast a ballot in person. Voting rights groups argue that the new primary rules would disenfranchise some voters. Wisconsin not moving its date As of now, Wisconsin’s primary is still scheduled to be held on April 7. Gov. Tony Evers – who on Monday issued a stay-at-home order for Wisconsin residents to try and prevent the spread of the coronavirus – is urging voters to cast ballots by mail. Wisconsin has no-excuse absentee voting, which state officials say are being sent in at a record pace. And there’s also curbside in-person voting in parts of the state. On the ballot: many crucial general election contests for mayors and county officials – as well as the presidential primary. Former Vice President Joe Biden’s campaign announced on Thursday that they’re starting to help education voters in Wisconsin on the mail-in options for the primary. “Our team has worked quickly to call into Wisconsin and talk to voters about their extended options to register online and request a mail-in ballot. We will seek to grow our delegate lead through remaining primary contests -- and we will do it safely,” Biden campaign manager Jennifer O’Malley Dillon wrote in an email to supporters. Wisconsin is also a crucial general election battleground state and O’Malley Dillon noted that the campaign’s “beginning to create a general election-ready foundation of engagement across priority states.” In the 2016 presidential election, then-GOP nominee Donald Trump narrowly carried Wisconsin and two other reliably blue states – Michigan and Pennsylvania – helping him to win the White House. $400 million to beef up voting by mail The massive $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package President Trump is waiting to sign into law upon likely passage by the House of Representatives includes $400 million to help states move toward mail-in voting, amid a pandemic that is forcing many Americans to shelter at home. The funds would assist states as they expand voting by mail, early voting, online registration and make in-person voting safer for all. Lawmakers and election advocates are warning that if states don’t receive federal assistance to move away from in-person voting, there could be low turnout and disruptions in November’s general election.

Amy Klobuchar announced on Thursday that her husband – who contracted COVID-19 – is now recovering at the family’s home. “Thanks to all who sent kind words and prayers for my husband John,” the Minnesota Democrat who suspended her presidential campaign earlier this month said in a statement. “He has coronavirus and has been in the hospital for pneumonia and low oxygen.

"                          Dr. Manny Alvarez discusses if President Trump's timeline of getting the country back to work by Easter Sunday is realistic In his bitter, five-year battle with the media, I’m not sure President Trump has ever leveled a more serious charge than he is making right now. He’s turned “fake news” into an indelible slogan. He has called such news “the enemy of the people.” He has suggested that some journalists are traitors. And look, all kinds of media people have said all kinds of terrible things about the president, so there is deep hostility on both sides. But I was still taken aback, in the midst of this virus crisis, when Trump tweeted this the other day: “The LameStream Media is the dominant force in trying to get me to keep our Country closed as long as possible in the hope that it will be detrimental to my election success.” WHEN BAD NEWS IS PERSONAL: JOURNALISTS, POLITICIANS FIGHTING THE VIRUS And at a briefing, he said journalists and other critics have an ulterior motive for objecting to his hope that businesses and other institutions could reopen by Easter. Responding to CBS’s Paula Reid, he said: “The media would like to see me do poorly in the election...There are people in your profession that write fake news. You do, she does...” Now I’ve written and spoken endlessly, including in my last book, about media animus toward this president. But to insinuate that journalists want the country to remain shut down to politically damage Trump is way off base. This is the crisis of our generation, and no one is unaffected. Most journalists are working from home and many of them have their kids home from shuttered schools. Some are being laid off, especially in smaller markets, and pay cuts at places like BuzzFeed. Like everyone else, their 401Ks have taken a beating. Like everyone else, they can’t go to a restaurant or movie or play or museum or watch sports on TV. And, because their jobs often involve contact with newsmakers, some are getting the virus, and infecting other family members, as I reported yesterday. One retired New York Times reporter and editor died this week from the virus. Who would possibly want this madness to continue? Everyone I know is just aching for life to return to some semblance of normalcy. SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES It’s true the journalistic consensus is that Trump would be mistaken to rush a reopening of businesses and schools (though such decisions are largely up to the governors). They argue, based on a majority of medical experts, that it will take significantly longer to flatten the so-called curve. In this view, while shutting down much of America is causing great pain -- a record 3.3 million jobless claims disclosed yesterday -- saving thousands of lies is a more urgent priority. Now maybe they’re wrong. Maybe they’re misguided. Maybe they are underestimating the impact of bringing the economy to a halt for so long, or overestimating the health impact of restarting it sooner rather than later. But the notion that they deliberately want to inflict further damage on America’s ailing economy because it will hurt Trump is outlandish. We are all suffering, and all in this together. That’s not to say many of them aren’t hoping that the coronavirus leads to Trump’s defeat. That’s not to say they don’t believe he has bungled the greatest test of his presidency--first by reacting too slowly, and now by talking about abandoning many of the restrictions too quickly. In short, all of us -- journalists and non-journalists, conservatives and liberals, pro-Trumpers and never-Trumpers, and the president himself, wish we could get back to the old normal -- however much we may disagree on the best path.

Our country is facing a challenging time. Americans are feeling anxious about their health, fear of what lies ahead, and sadness for what has been lost as a result of COVID-19. Yet, as Americans, we are resilient when we face adversity and during this time, we have seen the great spirit of Americans helping each other. Unprecedented times call for a strong leader. My father-in-law, President Trump, is showing what leadership looks like in a time of crisis. He is taking bold and historic steps to combat COVID-19. While Democrats and the media were obsessing over impeachment, the president took early and effective actions to stop the spread of coronavirus. He ordered travel restrictions on China and Europe and restricted our southern and northern borders. Less than a month after learning of the virus, the CDC began working on a vaccine. By March, the president announced that the first potential vaccine entered a ""phase on""e trial, breaking records for the speed it moved Save as Draftto trials. TRUMP CAMPAIGN OFFICES TO STAY CLOSED THROUGH APRIL BECAUSE OF CORONAVIRUS While these scientific developments were taking place, the president and the administration led efforts to support states, small businesses, jobs and American families. They’ve waived interest rates on federally held student loans and afforded borrowers the option to suspend payments. They have prioritized the health care of our most vulnerable veterans, and deployed tens of thousands of masks, gowns and other medical devices to states in need. Sadly, while your president is hard at work, Democrats are playing politics with people’s lives. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and her fellow Democrats spent their efforts adding completely unrelated agenda items to the economic stimulus package, which slowed down negotiations in Congress. At a time when Americans are vulnerable, jeopardizing the security of the country as well as blocking much-needed help is reckless and wrong.

Fred Keller, R-Pa. said Thursday that he plans to introduce a bill next week aimed at halting inmate movement in the federal prison system during the coronavirus pandemic, giving the Bureau of Prisons the authority to keep prisoners in place as worries grow about the coronavirus spreading among the U.S. prison population. A release from Keller's office Thursday said the Republican had spoken with Bureau of Prisons Director Michael Carvajal by phone. It said that though Carvajal was concerned about the spread of the coronavirus, he is required by law to defer to courts and the U.S. Marshal's Service on moving inmates to, from and between federal prisons. ""After several days of talking with members of Bureau of Prisons leadership, today I spoke directly with Director Carvajal,"" Keller said in a statement. ""While Director Carvajal shared my concern about ongoing inmate movement, he believes that doing so requires statutory authority. As a result, I have immediately started work on introducing legislation that would give the Bureau of Prisons the authority it needs to stop inmate movement during COVID-19 mitigation efforts. As I continue down this path, I will also be exhausting all available remedies with the Department of Justice to immediately halt all inmate movement."" CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW AHEAD OF CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS VOTE, HOUSE LAWMAKERS CONCERNED REP. MASSIE MAY TRIGGER DELAY But Keller's bill, even if it passes quickly in the House of Representatives, could be stalled for weeks. After passing a $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief package earlier this week, the Senate adjourned until April 20. Though Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he could reconvene the body before April 20, it is unlikely he would call back senators from across the country for anything other than an important vote on a large bill. Keller says that he is also trying other approaches to stop inmate movement in American prisons. ""While I hope, given the national urgency to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, any legislation stopping BOP prisoner movement can pass Congress quickly, it is just one avenue I am pursuing,"" he told Fox News. ""The fastest way to stop inmate movement is for those in charge of this process to see the danger continued inmate movement poses to BOP employees and their communities and stop it immediately."" Keller's efforts to stop federal inmate movement come after 32 federal inmates were transported from Oklahoma to FCC Allenwood, a prison in his district. Two of those inmates had symptoms lining up with those of the coronavirus and one was taken to a hospital and tested for the virus. CONCERN GROWS FOR VULNERABLE PRISON POPULATIONS AND EMPLOYEES AS CORONAVIRUS SPREADS THROUGH OVERSTUFFED FACILITIES ""These set of facts are disturbing and unacceptable,"" Keller said at the time. ""Clearly, BOP cannot guarantee the safety of BOP inmates, employees, their families, or the broader community. As such, continuing to move inmates throughout the BOP system while COVID-19 continues to spread is a mistake and must be immediately stopped."" As Keller works to keep prisoners where they are, others are raising the alarm about the danger the coronavirus could pose to U.S. inmates. ""The projections for the toll that the coronavirus might inflict on U.S. cities like New York are terrifying. But for prisons and jails, which are like small cities unto themselves, it is likely to get even more dire. Detention facilities are ripe for the spread of disease, given the rampant overcrowding and subpar health care,"" Jesse Lerner-Kinglake of Just Detention, which advocates for prisoner rights nationwide, told Fox News. ""Worse still, many prisoners have HIV, diabetes, heart disease and other serious illnesses that put them at risk for developing complications from the coronavirus. Imagine New York City, but more crowded and with more sick people — and far fewer medical staff."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It is difficult for prisons to take the kind of precautions being pushed to stem the spread of the coronavirus, including social distancing and not sharing communal space. Hand sanitizer is even banned due to its high alcohol content. At least 15 different states have begun to release at least some low-level or vulnerable prisoners to protect them from the outbreak.

Among the many provisions in the $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief package that appear to have little to do with the immediate crisis at home is a nearly $11 billion pot of money for three international development groups. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) – which the House of Representatives is expected to vote on Friday – includes the funding for the African Development Fund (ADF), the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the International Development Association (IDA). CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW The ADF and the AfDB are two related organizations that help fund development and poverty eradication efforts in Africa, whereas the IDA is a subsidiary of the World Bank that gives to poor countries in general. Combined, they will receive more than $10.8 billion under the CARES Act. This amount includes $7,286,587,008 for the AfDB, $513,900,000 for the ADF and $3,004,200,000 for the IDA.       Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky. gives a thumbs up as he leaves the Senate chamber on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, March 25, 2020, where a deal has been reached on a coronavirus bill. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)       CORONAVIRUS BILL MORE THAN DOUBLE THE SIZE OF FDR'S NEW DEAL: HOW IT COMPARES As the costliest stimulus measure in U.S. history, the bill has generated a mixed and often-conflicted reaction even from those advocating for it. The package contains sorely needed relief for struggling workers facing layoffs as businesses are forced to temporarily shutter on an unprecedented scale in a bid to curb the spread of coronavirus. But some have questioned the massive pot of money set aside for loans to big industries, while others have challenged the array of seemingly unrelated or tangential funding pipelines that made their way in. Controversial appropriations tucked into the coronavirus stimulus package include $25 million for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, with a stipulation that the funds are to help deal with the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. There is no such language connected to the AfDB, ADF or IDA provisions. The inclusion of these funds comes after a plea from the Center for Global Development (CGD) for the U.S. to include funding for international organizations in its coronavirus relief package, citing the possibility that even after the virus is under control in the United States, it could see a resurgence if there are not strong enough efforts to suppress it worldwide. ""[T]o put it bluntly, the United States will not be safe from this pandemic until the world is safe from this pandemic—without widespread access to a vaccine or countermeasures, cases rebound quickly when quarantines are lifted as has been shown in Singapore and Hong Kong this week,"" read a letter the CGD sent to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., last week. The funding for these three international organizations was not an 11th-hour addition; it was included in the original Republican version of the coronavirus bill.

""This bipartisan deal is a raw deal for the people,"" Rep Justin Amash, I-Mich., a former Republican, tweeted Wednesday. ""It does far too little for those who need the most help, while providing hundreds of billions in corporate welfare, massively growing government, inhibiting economic adaptation, and widening the gap between the rich and the poor.""

The State Department announced Friday that it is waiving the interview requirement for most agricultural guest worker visas in response to the coronavirus crisis -- a move that brought criticism from immigration hawks. “Secretary Pompeo, in consultation with the Department of Homeland Security, has authorized consular officers to expand the categories of H-2 visa applicants whose applications can be adjusted without an in-person interview,” the agency said in a statement. DOJ POSTPONES 'REMAIN IN MEXICO' HEARINGS IN RESPONSE TO CORONAVIRUS THREAT The H-2 program allows temporary guest workers in the agricultural industry (H-2A) and in seasonal, non-agricultural work (H-2B) to come to the U.S. But there has been a particular focus on the H-2A program recently due to questions about the food supply in a time of the coronavirus crisis. Officials can now waive the visa interview requirement, one of the most daunting aspects of any visa application for a potential immigrant, for H-2 applicants if they do not have any apparent or potential ineligibility. The new guidelines also increase the period in which returning workers can qualify for a waiver. The agency had suspended visa services at embassies and consulates last week, but this week called the H-2 program “essential to the economy and food security of the United States and...a national security priority,” said it would be processing H-2 cases “as much as possible.” Supporters say such visas are vital for the U.S. economy in times of surges in need, but opponents say they are rife with abuse and incentivize companies to use cheap labor instead of updating their technology or raising wages to attract American workers. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., had written to Pompeo this week, urging him to take action on H-2A visas. CORONAVIRUS BILL INCLUDES $350 MILLION FOR MIGRATION, REFUGEE ASSISTANCE “The ability to harvest food is critical to our nation’s food security, particularly during a national emergency,” Feinstein said in a letter. “I ask that you consider the food security needs of our nation and take every precaution necessary to protect public health during the coronavirus pandemic. Interrupting the issuance of H-2A agricultural visas – particularly for returning workers who have no inadmissibility concern – harms our national interests and may cause an interruption to our food supply in the midst of a global pandemic.” A coalition of agricultural groups had also urged Pompeo to prioritize the visas, arguing that action was needed in order to keep the food supply chain intact. “The failure to take necessary action to protect our food supply will result in bare shelves in grocery store produce aisles, not from panic buying, but as the result of the federal government directly causing a shortage of critical labor,” a letter from the Agriculture Workforce Coalition said. As a result of the interview waiver, the State Department said it anticipates that “the vast majority of otherwise qualified H-2 applicants will now be adjudicated without an interview.” Groups who push for lower levels of migration overall oppose the move, pointing in particular to the spike in unemployment that the crisis has caused -- which they say makes more immigration unnecessary when millions of Americans are looking for work. “This crisis has shown that we must move away from reliance on foreign workers in the agriculture industry and move into the 21st century. The Trump administration could have used the coronavirus bill to address food security issues through mechanization grants and no interest loans,” RJ Hauman, head of government relations at Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), told Fox News. “Instead, they bought into the agriculture lobby’s pathetic, despicable plea – that a country of over 320 million people on the cusp of record unemployment can’t get its own food harvested without cheap foreign labor,” he said. The easing up of H-2 visas is in contrast to a number of other moves by the administration that restricted migration and travel into the U.S. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The administration has largely banned travel from China, Iran and Europe into the U.S. in response to the crisis. It has also restricted travel across land borders with Canada and Mexico to essential travel only.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. Rep. Fred Keller, R-Pa., said Thursday that he plans to introduce a bill next week aimed at halting the movement of inmates in the federal prison system during the coronavirus pandemic, giving the Bureau of Prisons the authority to keep prisoners in place. A release from Keller's office said the Republican had spoken with Bureau of Prisons Director Michael Carvajal by phone. He explained that although Carvajal was concerned about the spread of the coronavirus, he is required by law to defer to courts and the U.S. Marshal's Service when it comes to moving inmates to, from and between federal prisons. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW ""After several days of talking with members of Bureau of Prisons leadership, today I spoke directly with Director Carvajal,"" Keller said in the statement. ""While Director Carvajal shared my concern about ongoing inmate movement, he believes that doing so requires statutory authority. As a result, I have immediately started work on introducing legislation that would give the Bureau of Prisons the authority it needs to stop inmate movement during COVID-19 mitigation efforts. As I continue down this path, I will also be exhausting all available remedies with the Department of Justice to immediately halt all inmate movement."" AHEAD OF CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS VOTE, HOUSE LAWMAKERS CONCERNED REP. MASSIE MAY TRIGGER DELAY But Keller's bill, even if it passes quickly in the House of Representatives, could be stalled for weeks. After passing a $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief package earlier this week, the Senate has adjourned until April 20. While Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he could reconvene the body before April 20, it is unlikely he would call back senators from across the country for anything other than an important vote on a large bill. Keller says that he is also trying other approaches to stop inmate movement in American prisons. ""While I hope, given the national urgency to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, any legislation stopping BOP prisoner movement can pass Congress quickly, it is just one avenue I am pursuing,"" he told Fox News. ""The fastest way to stop inmate movement is for those in charge of this process to see the danger continued inmate movement poses to BOP employees and their communities and stop it immediately."" Keller's efforts to stop federal inmate movement come after 32 federal inmates were transported from Oklahoma to FCC Allenwood, a prison in his district. Two of those inmates had symptoms lining up with those of the coronavirus and one was taken to a hospital and tested for the virus. CONCERN GROWS FOR VULNERABLE PRISON POPULATIONS AND EMPLOYEES AS CORONAVIRUS SPREADS THROUGH OVERSTUFFED FACILITIES ""These set of facts are disturbing and unacceptable,"" Keller said at the time. ""Clearly, BOP cannot guarantee the safety of BOP inmates, employees, their families, or the broader community. As such, continuing to move inmates throughout the BOP system while COVID-19 continues to spread is a mistake and must be immediately stopped."" As Keller works to keep prisoners where they are, others are raising the alarm about the danger the coronavirus could pose to U.S. inmates. ""The projections for the toll that the coronavirus might inflict on U.S. cities like New York are terrifying. But for prisons and jails, which are like small cities unto themselves, it is likely to get even more dire. Detention facilities are ripe for the spread of disease, given the rampant overcrowding and subpar health care,"" Jesse Lerner-Kinglake of Just Detention, which advocates for prisoner rights nationwide, told Fox News. ""Worse still, many prisoners have HIV, diabetes, heart disease and other serious illnesses that put them at risk for developing complications from the coronavirus. Imagine New York City, but more crowded and with more sick people — and far fewer medical staff."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It is difficult for prisons to take the kind of precautions being pushed to stem the spread of the coronavirus, including social distancing and not sharing communal space. Hand sanitizer is even banned due to its high alcohol content. At least 15 different states have begun to release at least some low-level or vulnerable prisoners to protect them from the outbreak.

"                          There are deep worries on both sides of the aisle that Rep. Thomas Massie could try to sidetrack plans to quickly approve a coronavirus bill; Chad Pergram reports from Capitol Hill. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. Furious lawmakers voiced serious concerns on Capitol Hill late Thursday that a Republican House member could “go rogue” and possibly scuttle a vote on the $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package, and potentially endanger other House members in the process, Fox News has learned. Fox News is told there is deep worry on both sides of the aisle that Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., could try to sidetrack House plans to quickly approve the coronavirus bill via a “voice vote” -- a verbal exercise in which those in favor shout yea, and those opposed holler nay. The loudest side would prevail. “It’s the Thomas Massie show,” said one senior Republican source who asked to not be identified. “He is going to do it,” a senior Republican leadership source told Fox News, explaining that leadership had tried every type of arm twisting -- and it's not working. The source said he was actively calling members and telling them to get on planes in the morning to come back to Washington, so that a quorum of 216 members could be established if Massie or another member were to demand one. The source explained that Massie got a very forceful call from a close confidant and member of the House Freedom Caucus urging him to allow the voice vote, but Massie won’t budge. “We have been riding [House Speaker Nancy] Pelosi for stalling things, and now this,” the source lamented. Asked whether the House leadership was concerned about others besides Massie, another source replied, “There are others who are egging him on.” “He had better not do that!” screamed one livid senior House Democratic aide into the phone when asked about such a scenario and Massie. “He’s going to make everyone in the building get [coronavirus].” A senior administration source declined to comment to Fox News when asked if the Trump administration made efforts to curb any potential parliamentary mischief by Massie. “A lot of members are pi--ed off,” one source said. “If we don’t have a quorum on tomorrow, we’ll definitely have one by Saturday.” The 880-page coronavirus stimulus package would amount to the largest economic relief bill in the history of the U.S. for individuals, large corporations, and small businesses -- and its unanimous passage in the Senate came despite grave concerns on both sides about whether it involved too much spending, or not enough. Massie did not respond to multiple requests for comment from Fox News late Thursday. It was unclear exactly why he may want to delay the bill, which some lawmakers have said contains too much wasteful spending -- including $25 million for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C.       Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., seen here in 2015, did not immediately comment. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call, File)       Amid the confusion, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., distributed a floor schedule late Thursday saying the House will convene at 9 a.m. ET Friday, and there will be two hours of debate. ""Members are advised that it is possible this measure will not pass by voice vote,"" the schedule reads. ""Members are encouraged to follow the guidance of their local and state health officials, however if they are able and willing to be in Washington D.C. by 10:00 a.m. tomorrow, Members are encouraged to do so with caution,"" Hoyer's schedule continues. “You might have one grandstander,” President Trump warned at a coronavirus press conference earlier in the day. “It will pass. It will just take a little longer."" Also in the evening Thursday, Fox News spoke to a Republican member who was returning to Washington due to the potential Massie situation. The member expressed shock that there could be delays given that the Senate passed the stimulus bill by a 96-0 unanimous vote. “I’m coming to D.C. to ensure the bill passes,” the GOP member told Fox News. “It’s frustrating having to be prepared for this scenario. ... I really wish members would put people first and just get this done. Heck, if 100 percent of senators can agree, it’s pretty clear this is going to pass. Only thing a member would be doing is holding it up at great risk to the American people. It’s very troublesome a member of Congress would engage in such a tactic.” THE CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL: LOANS, CHECKS, 'PORK' & MORE Top Democrats and Republicans have indicated they’d prefer a voice vote because it would not require as many members to return to the Capitol, and would speed a vote along. However, after the voice vote, any member simply may call for “a recorded vote.” That automatically would trigger the roll call. That’s where House members insert cards into electronic voting machines and vote either yes, no or present. The House then documents and records the ballot of each member. ""A lot of members are pi--ed off."" In the event a roll-call vote were to be needed because Massie demands one, leadership could push to delay the vote until Saturday to give members time to travel back to D.C., according to the two congressional sources. The plan for a roll-call vote is to divide the members into 16 groups of 30 members apiece to file into the chamber “to minimize the risks posed by placing too many individuals in one location,” according to an internal security memo obtained by Fox News. READ THE FULL SECURITY MEMO A ""State of the Union""-style extreme posture will be in effect on Capitol Hill on Friday, according to the memo, sent by Capitol Attending Physician Dr. Brian Monahan and House Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving to all House members ahead of Friday's coronavirus vote. “A recorded vote could take five or six hours,” even once all necessary members are back in Washington, one House aide complained. That’s because the House would stretch out the vote, according to the memo, having only members enter the chamber to vote in small clusters to contain the coronavirus risk. Most votes in the House have taken about 20 or so minutes. Votes are sometimes reduced to five or even two minutes if everyone is in the chamber. (The longest vote in House history came on Nov. 23, 2003, and ran 2 hours and 55 minutes. It started at 3 a.m. ET and ended just before 6 a.m. ET on a measure to expand Medicare.) There could be a deeper problem than the logistics of taking a roll call vote, however. Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution notes that the House and Senate need “a Majority of each shall constitue a Quorum to do Business.” Massie or any other member could make a point of order -- in which a member asserts that the House or Senate is not operating properly under its own rules -- that the House doesn’t have a quroum. Therefore, the House can't vote if it lacks a quorum. With 430 members, 216 constitutes a quorum. House Rule XX dictates parameters for establishing quorums in the House of Representatives. Rule XX, Clause 5 (c)(1) deals with the House reducing the number required for a quorum “due to catastrophic circumstances.” But, that rule would eventually trigger the House declaring a number of seats vacant over a period of days, and therefore isn't an option. In short, the House may have the votes by just a simple majority to pass the coronavirus bill. But if someone makes a point of order about the House lacking a quorum, then leaders will likely have to rustle up 216 members – be that Friday, over the weekend or next week – before the House could vote on the coronavirus bill. On a conference call with Democrats today, Pelosi, D-Calif., told members the House will vote Friday “if there’s a quorum tomorrow.” Separately, the security memo also indicated that limited personnel with no extra aides will be permitted at the Capitol. Only one or two persons will be allowed in the elevators at a time, and most will be encouraged to use the stairs, according to the memo. ""Access will be strictly limited to members of Congress, congressional staff who have an office located inside the Capitol and staff who have designated floor access. If a staff person does not have a Capitol office -- even if accompanied by a member -- they will not be permitted inside the Capitol,"" the memo stated. ""Credentialed press will be permitted, as will official business visitors to the House wing."" The document called for members to remain in their offices until voting. The officials are discouraging those “who are ill with respiratory symptoms or fever” from attending. WHO QUALIFIES FOR A CHECK? Officials also are expected to eliminate two of the six lecterns in the House chamber from which members may speak. The officials are asking members to keep away from each other inside the House chamber, and to clean the lectern themselves after they speak. On a GOP call Thursday afternoon, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., informed Republicans that a GOP member was threatening to request a recorded vote, according to one Republican on the call. The member wasn’t identified. Democrats are united in favor of a voice vote on the legislation Friday and there was no talk on a caucus call Thursday afternoon that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., or any other Democrat would try to gum up the process and force a recorded vote, according to a source familiar with the call. Behind the scenes, Capitol attending physicians, as well as party leaders in the House, have been working to discourage members from coming back to Washington to vote on the package, Fox News has learned. The not-so-subtle messaging, intended to avoid the unnecessary spread of the contagion, came as the House closed the gym normally available to members. “That’s to make it as uncomfortable as possible on them,” one source who asked not to be identified told Fox News. “Some of these members practically live out of the gym.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “Having all of these guys on planes, flying in and then going back spells trouble,” another senior source said. Fox News is told both sides have been trying to get a head count of how many members may actually show up. One source ventured a guess that it could range from “70 to 150.” Fox News' Leland Vittert contributed to this report.

The House of Representatives on Friday began debate on the massive $2.2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package aimed at reducing the spread of the disease and keeping Americans financially afloat as businesses shut down to limit social contact according to guidelines from the federal and state governments. It came as one GOP lawmaker was poised to potentially hold up proceedings -- and he faced scorching criticism from his colleagues and the White House over that scenario. ""We must take swift action to ensure that people can stay home to slow the spread of this deadly virus and that our economy can be supported so it can rebound when the medical experts and scientists say it is safe to do so,"" House Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer said as he kicked off three hours of debate on the measure. Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, also urged the House to approve the bill as quickly as possible. ""While no one will agree with every part of this rescue bill, we face a challenge rarely seen in America's history,"" he said. ""We must act now or the toll on lives and livelihoods will be far greater. I strongly urge its passage."" The House initially planned to pass the coronavirus stimulus package by unanimous consent or voice vote with a skeleton crew of legislators present in order to minimize the risk of spreading the coronavirus among its members. The body, under its rules, can pass legislation by unanimous consent -- with no representative in the chamber objecting -- or a voice vote -- an exercise in which those for and against a bill yell yea or nay, and the loudest side wins. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW CORONAVIRUS PACKAGE CONTAINS $11 BILLION FOR THREE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS But either method can be shut down by a ""point of order"" from a member who could argue a lack of quorum, meaning less than half of the House's total members are present in the chamber. At that point, it would need at least 216 total members present to hold a recorded vote. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., has indicated to House leaders, despite significant arm-twisting efforts from Republican leadership, that he may force a recorded vote by suggesting the lack of quorum. House leadership is also concerned a handful of other members -- Republicans and Democrats -- might be considering taking the same action. Massie faced an intense backlash from colleagues and even President Trump over the threat, with the president mocking him Friday morning as a “third rate Grandstander.” “He just wants the publicity. He can’t stop it, only delay, which is both dangerous...& costly,” Trump tweeted, before urging Republicans to win back the House but “throw Massie out of Republican Party!” On Fox News’ “American Newsroom,” New York Democratic Rep. Max Rose called Massie’s potential delay “disgusting” and “inhumane.” He went so far as to call him “un-American” and say he’d have “blood” on his hands with any further delay. Massie on Thursday night noted that the coronavirus bill, with about $2 trillion of new spending and $4 trillion of stimulus via monetary policy from the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve, equated to ""$60,000 per family of new national debt and dollar devaluation in this stimulus."" He also said in an interview with 55 KRC radio Thursday morning that he was interested in following the letter of the Constitution rather than a workaround in the House's rules. ""I'm having a really hard time with this. Because they're saying, well it's hard to travel, yadda yadda yadda,"" Massie said. ""Well, last night, 96 out of 100 Senators voted. All we would need is 218 out of 435 to vote,"" he added, pointing to a section of Article I in the U.S. Constitution that states ""a majority of each [body of the legislature] shall constitute a quorum to do business."" This has led to a mad scramble among some frustrated House members to return to D.C. in time to vote on Friday. The recorded vote might be put off until Saturday if the House cannot reach a quorum and one is demanded. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP On Friday morning, Speaker Nancy Pelosi noted that the House would have several hours of debate. As for whether there would be a roll call vote, she said they’d have to see. The House came to order seconds after 9 a.m. ET, with lawmakers expecting floor debate on the coronavirus stimulus before attempting to vote on the bill, which passed the Senate 96-0.

Rep. Thomas Massie, a libertarian-minded Republican, is against the massive stimulus bill to help the coronavirus-ravaged economy and has threatened to force a roll-call vote on the package in the House, infuriating lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who say traveling to the Capitol en masse to vote for a widely supported bill poses an unnecessary health and safety risk. ""Throw Massie out of Republican Party!"" Trump said at the end of a double-tweet tirade against the Kentucky pol. ""He just wants the publicity. He can’t stop it, only delay, which is both dangerous & costly. Workers & small businesses need money now in order to survive,"" Trump said. Thursday night and Friday morning, furious lawmakers flocked back to the Capitol -- which has already been rocked by the virus with several lawmakers testing positive for COVID-19 -- because leadership was made aware that Massie may not go along with a planned voice vote that would require just a skeleton group of lawmakers to be present. Rep. Pete King, R-N.Y., was livid he had to leave the epicenter state of the U.S. outbreak. ""Because of one member of Congress refusing to allow emergency action, entire Congress must be called back to vote in House,"" King tweeted. ""Risk of infection and risk of legislation being delayed. Disgraceful. Irresponsible."" Massie, who is against the bill, did not respond to Fox News' requests for comment. But in a radio interview Thursday, Massie said the Constitution calls for a quorum to vote in the House and he had little sympathy for House members having to come back, especially after the Senate managed to pass the legislation through a normal recorded vote. ""I'm having a really hard time with this. Because they're saying, well it's hard to travel, yadda yadda yadda,"" Massie told radio station 55KRC Thursday.

"                          Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders addresses the changes being made to his campaign during the outbreak. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.  Sen. Bernie Sanders admits that ""it's going to be a very steep road"" to mount a comeback and defeat former Vice President Joe Biden for the Democratic presidential nomination. But the populist senator from Vermont, in an interview with NPR that was broadcast Friday morning, said he’s still assessing the future of his presidential campaign.  After convincingly sweeping major primaries in Florida, Illinois, and Arizona a week and a half ago, Biden dramatically increased his lead over Sanders in the race for convention delegates, cemented his position as the near-certain Democratic presidential nominee, and all-but-mathematically eliminated Sanders from winning. MORE STATES POSTPONE PRIMARIES OR MOVE TO 100 PERCENT MAIL IN BALLOTS But with many Americans huddling at home to prevent the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, most of the remaining primaries have been postponed, robbing Biden of the chance to clinch the nomination soon. And it’s brought an end to campaign rallies and town halls, forcing candidates and their campaigns to connect with voters online rather than in-person. ""It's changing every day because elections are being delayed,"" Sanders said when asked about how the reassessment of his campaign is faring. ""Where do we go from here with the elections that are being delayed, where we can't go out and hold rallies or knock on doors? That's what we're looking at right now.” But Sanders doesn’t seem in any rush to suspend his campaign. While the senator has stopped criticizing Biden and is no longer fundraising for his White House bid, he’s remained very active – holding virtual campaign events to discuss the coronavirus outbreak and raise funds to benefit the response to the pandemic. The Sanders campaign has also spotlighted how it's ramping up organizing efforts in New York ahead of that state’s primary – which for now is still scheduled to take place on April 28 – and in Pennsylvania, which is moving its primary to June. And, earlier this week, Sanders aides told The New York Times that if there’s a Democratic presidential primary debate in April, their candidate expects to participate. “If there is a debate in April, he plans to be there,” the Sanders campaign told Fox News. ""I think the American people, especially in this unprecedented moment in American history, want to hear the ideas that will lead us away from where we are right now,"" Sanders told NPR, as he spotlighted his progressive proposals on the economy, criminal justice reform, and climate change. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN  ""These are enormously important issues and we need serious debates over them,” added the independent senator who’s making his second straight bid for the Democratic nomination. Biden said he’s “had enough” of primary debates and that it’s time to “get on with this.” Asked on a conference call Wednesday with reporters if there should be another primary debate in April, Biden said: “My focus is just dealing with this crisis right now. I haven’t thought about any more debates. I think we’ve had enough debates. I think we should get on with this.” The Democratic National Committee has yet to weigh in on whether an April debate will take place. An outside adviser who’s close to Sanders told Fox News: “I think for Bernie, the presidential campaign has always been part of a larger movement and the ideals and the goals that the movement set for itself.” The adviser, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely, emphasized that Sanders is now mapping out how to transition from a presidential campaign to a political movement. “I think he clearly sees the end of the road. It’s just a matter of how he transitions the campaign into his future work leading the movement,"" the adviser said.

A U.S. Army Ranger veteran and entrepreneur teamed up with a country music star and a bunch of their friends to create and perform a new song promoting safe habits during the coronavirus outbreak. The song, called ""Quarantine,"" is getting hundreds of thousands of views on Youtube. Mat Best, of veteran-owned Black Rifle Coffee Company, and singer-songwriter Tim Montana sing along with the likes of Medal of Honor recipient Dakota Meyer, Navy Cross and Purple Heart recipient Marcus Luttrell, and celebrities, like actor Charlie Sheen and singer Chris Kirkpatrick. ""We have so much organic traffic on our social media,"" said Best on ""Fox and Friends"" on Friday, ""so we thought that it would be a great idea to promote the quarantine, social distancing, stop the spread of the disease and also raise awareness for our medical professionals."" FOX NATION'S ABBY HORNACEK LAUNCHES SOCIAL MEDIA CHALLENGE TO ADDRESS SEVERE BLOOD DONATION SHORTAGE ""Right now is the time to unite together, support the people fighting the disease and then stop the spread of it,"" he said. Best and Montana have close family members in the medical field, and they encouraged Americans to do what they can to support health care professionals. ""He is a PHD virologist in Washington, D.C. that is actually on the front lines, reviewing medication,"" said Montana of his brother. ""He's a lot smarter than me, let's put it that way."" ""I'm talking to him every day, he's staying up til 1, 2 in the morning, just rushing this stuff though,"" Montana continued. ""He's just bustin' his butt and I couldn't be more prouder of him. He's the rock star today."" ""Having such close family in the medical world that is what they are advising us,"" added Best, reiterating advice that Americans self-isolate. ""Stay home, social distancing and then any way that we can a provide whether it is coffee or support to [health care professionals] because they are putting in the long, long hours — that's what we are going to do.""

It seems to be a refrain among health care experts grappling with the severity of the coronavirus pandemic. “The temperature is definitely rising,” said the healthcare provider, whose hospital is located some 30 miles north of New York City. NYC EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN: CORONAVIRUS CASES RISING, WE NEED 'MORE OF EVERYTHING' “This is the illness that will define my generation of nurses,” the nurse said.       Police guard area where New York State's first drive through coronavirus mobile testing center opened in New Rochelle, N.Y.       (REUTERS/Mike Segar) Working in the hospital’s specialized cancer treatment facility hasn’t done much to assuage the health professional's fears, or those of the people who rely on health care workers for treatment. “Coming to work, even in my insulated workplace, feels ominous,” the nurse said. “[Our patients] are scared, and rightfully so. They are literally risking their lives to come for treatment and aside from eliminating visitors, mandating masks and taking everyone’s temperature at the front door, there is nothing more we can do to ensure their safety."" Still, the nurse argued that the scariest part of witnessing this crisis from the inside, whether from the specialized unit or on the front lines like the nurse's colleagues, is the apparent lack of preparedness. New York City has seen over 23,000 cases of COVID-19. “Never in my nursing career have we (I) not been able to give a [patient] an answer as to what comes next until now,” said the healthcare pro. “I think we all believed that we were better prepared for an event like this, but the reality has been sobering.” CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE  This isn’t just a local problem either, the nurse suggested. “I’m frustrated with both our federal leadership, as well as our health care delivery system. Lack of testing and available equipment are inexcusable considering the financial resources available in this country,"" the nurse said. ""Never in my nursing career have we (I) not been able to give a [patient] an answer as to what comes next until now."" “We’ve been blind to the real and more likely threats that face us. Now, sadly, many innocent people are going to pay dearly for our leadership’s inexcusable ignorance.” As of Friday morning, the novel coronavirus had infected more than 542,000 people across 175 countries and territories, resulting in over 24,361 deaths. In the U.S., all 50 states plus the District of Columbia have reported confirmed cases of COVID-19, tallying over 85,996 illnesses and at least 1,300 deaths.

"                          With the coronavirus relief package being the costliest stimulus measure in U.S. history, it is set to also include funding for provisions that do not directly help deal with the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. Here’s what you should know about the $11 billion fund included in the package. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.  Sign up here. Among the many provisions in the $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief package that appear to have little to do with the immediate crisis at home is a nearly $11 billion pot of money for three international development groups. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) – which the House of Representatives is expected to vote on Friday – includes the funding for the African Development Fund (ADF), the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the International Development Association (IDA). CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW The ADF and the AfDB are two related organizations that help fund development and poverty eradication efforts in Africa, whereas the IDA is a subsidiary of the World Bank that gives to poor countries in general. Combined, they will receive more than $10.8 billion under the CARES Act. This amount includes $7,286,587,008 for the AfDB, $513,900,000 for the ADF and $3,004,200,000 for the IDA.       Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky. gives a thumbs up as he leaves the Senate chamber on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, March 25, 2020, where a deal has been reached on a coronavirus bill. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)       CORONAVIRUS BILL MORE THAN DOUBLE THE SIZE OF FDR'S NEW DEAL: HOW IT COMPARES As the costliest stimulus measure in U.S. history, the bill has generated a mixed and often-conflicted reaction even from those advocating for it. The package contains sorely needed relief for struggling workers facing layoffs as businesses are forced to temporarily shutter on an unprecedented scale in a bid to curb the spread of coronavirus. But some have questioned the massive pot of money set aside for loans to big industries, while others have challenged the array of seemingly unrelated or tangential funding pipelines that made their way in. Controversial appropriations tucked into the coronavirus stimulus package include $25 million for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, with a stipulation that the funds are to help deal with the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. There is no such language connected to the AfDB, ADF or IDA provisions. The inclusion of these funds comes after a plea from the Center for Global Development (CGD) for the U.S. to include funding for international organizations in its coronavirus relief package, citing the possibility that even after the virus is under control in the United States, it could see a resurgence if there are not strong enough efforts to suppress it worldwide. ""[T]o put it bluntly, the United States will not be safe from this pandemic until the world is safe from this pandemic—without widespread access to a vaccine or countermeasures, cases rebound quickly when quarantines are lifted as has been shown in Singapore and Hong Kong this week,"" read a letter the CGD sent to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., last week. The funding for these three international organizations was not an 11th-hour addition; it was included in the original Republican version of the coronavirus bill. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The striking $2.2 trillion price tag of the CARES Act, meanwhile, has been more a point of pride for both Republicans and Democrats, considering the severity of the coronavirus pandemic and its economic consequences, than a concerning federal expenditure. But at least one House member has raised the alarm about the amount of spending in the bill. ""This bipartisan deal is a raw deal for the people,"" Rep Justin Amash, I-Mich., a former Republican, tweeted Wednesday. ""It does far too little for those who need the most help, while providing hundreds of billions in corporate welfare, massively growing government, inhibiting economic adaptation, and widening the gap between the rich and the poor.""

"                          Insight from congressional correspondent Chad Pergram and senior political analyst Brit Hume. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.  Sign up here. The House of Representatives on Friday overwhelmingly approved a more than $2 trillion package to combat the coronavirus pandemic and send economic relief to workers and businesses squeezed by restrictions meant to stop the outbreak’s spread. The legislation, approved by voice vote despite 11th-hour drama arising from a GOP lawmaker’s objections, amounts to the costliest stimulus plan in U.S. history. It includes checks for most Americans, boosted unemployment aid, help for small business as well as a massive loan fund for corporations – at a time when unemployment is surging at a record pace, a consequence of businesses closing in compliance with social distancing guidelines. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW The bill, already approved by the Senate, now goes to President Trump's desk. “This bill is not only a rescue package, it is a commitment… that your government and the people whom you’ve elected to serve will do everything we can to limit the harm and hardship you face, both now and the foreseeable future,” House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said prior to the vote. The approval, while widely anticipated, followed a stretch of uncertainty over whether one congressman -- concerned about the stunning cost of the package -- might be able to stall the vote. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., had furiously objected to a simple voice vote that would have required only a minimal number of lawmakers to travel. Massie, as part of his push, wanted to ensure there is a quorum, which would require half of the members to show up on Capitol Hill. So as President Trump and others accused him of grandstanding, hundreds of lawmakers were summoned to Washington D.C. Thursday night and Friday morning from coronavirus-ravaged communities in New York, California and elsewhere. This, despite strict guidelines from the Capitol physician advising lawmakers not to congregate at the Capitol and stay in their offices until needed to avoid the spread of the virus that has already infected several lawmakers. While Massie was able to ensure many lawmakers showed up for the vote, he was not, in the end, able to force a roll-call. The House, after several hours of debate, ultimately passed the measure by voice vote, and it was allowed to stand. There were loud cries for ‘ayes’ and few rumblings of ‘nos’ on the House floor. “The ayes have it,” declared the presiding officer Rep. Anthony Brown, D-Md. But Massie stood up and objected. “I came here to make sure our republic doesn’t die by unanimous consent in an empty chamber and I request a recorded vote,” Massie said. Brown ruled that an insufficient number of lawmakers stood in support of a roll call vote. But Massie pressed on. “I object on the basis that a quorum is not present,” Massie said, instructing a count of lawmakers. “A quorum is present and the motion is adopted,” Brown ruled, to applause. Minutes before the vote, Speaker Nancy Pelosi also took to the floor to summon lawmakers in an effort to gather quorum and shut down the Massie effort. Pelosi touted the aid forthcoming for hospitals, Americans and small businesses, while acknowledging that more needs to be done for the frontline healthcare workers and paying homage to a New York nurse who died while serving at a hospital that didn’t have enough gowns. “We know that this cannot be our final bill,” Pelosi said. In a series of speeches prior to the historic rescue bill, lawmakers pressed for unity. “We're going to help American through this,"" McCarthy said. ""We're going to do this together and in the end, we are going to be healthier, stronger and more united than ever before because as Americans, that's who we are.” Upon catching wind of the plan to stop a roll-call vote, though, Massie howled on Twitter over the parliamentary machinations. ""It’s pretty clear now, with enough members here to pass the bill, that Pelosi and McCarthy are still working together to block a recorded vote just to insulate members of Congress from ACCOUNTABILITY. Biggest spending bill in the history of mankind, and no recorded vote? #SWAMP,"" he tweeted. Emotions ran hot on the House floor all morning Friday before the vote on the $2 trillion stimulus bill. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., started her impassioned floor speech by noting 13 people died in one day at Queen’s Elmhurst Hospital and medical professionals still don’t have enough ventilators and personal protection equipment. She ripped the Senate for fighting for corporate bailouts that will contribute to the income inequality gap in order for families to get “crumbs.” “What did the Senate majority fight for? One of the largest corporate bailouts with as few strings as possible in American history. Shameful!” Ocasio-Cortez said. “The greed of that fight is wrong for crumbs for our families “There should be shame about what was fought for in this bill, and the choices that we have to make.” On the other side of the aisle, Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., said he’s “distressed by the Hobson’s choice” put forth before lawmakers Friday saying lawmakers shouldn’t have to accept unrelated  “bailouts” to send relief. “As we discussed this and also discuss a fourth [package], no more Hobson's choice. No more billion-dollar bailouts for things that are unrelated. No more policies that are long-standing for a short-standing issue that needs are critical attention,” Perry said. “…Whatever we do, let's do no harm.” In a bizarre and seemingly unnecessary point of drama, Rep. Haley Stevens, D-Mich., refused to stop speaking when her time ran out on the House floor, even though Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., was willing to let her finish if she had just paused to let him officially grant her more time. Instead, Stevens continued yelling and held up her hands – clad with pink surgical gloves—in an apparent homage to front line healthcare workers fighting the coronavirus pandemic even though her mic was cut. As the presiding speaker was pounding the gavel and ruling Stevens “out of order,” Stevens screamed, “do not be afraid!” Republicans, who are trying hard to flip the freshman rep’s seat in November, immediately pounced on the outburst as a “meltdown.” The bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion-plus annual federal budget. The $2.2 trillion estimate is the White House's best guess of the spending it contains. The legislation would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year and $2,400 to a married couple making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child. Unemployment insurance would be made far more generous, with $600 per week tacked onto regular state jobless payments through the end of July. States and local governments would receive $150 billion in supplemental funding to help them provide basic and emergency services during the crisis. The legislation also establishes a $454 billion program for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries in hopes of leveraging up to $4.5 trillion in lending to distressed businesses, states, and municipalities. All would be up to the Treasury Department's discretion, though businesses controlled by Trump or immediate family members and by members of Congress would be ineligible. There was also $150 billion devoted to the health care system, including $100 billion for grants to hospitals and other health care providers buckling under the strain of COVID-19 caseloads. Frustrations were already hot as lawmakers had to return to Washington in a panic after Massie, R-Ky., threatened to upend plans for a simple voice vote and force a recorded vote. Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., alluded to the Massie controversy on the House floor. “So to you who oppose this bill. Please, please stand down. We can't wait another day to help. Don't add to this disruption, by in fact, being a disruptor. Be a leader,"" Upton said. Lawmakers spoke passionately about how COVID-19 is hurting the health of their communities and how the widespread shutdown of the economy is crippling families and businesses. Yet many openly grappled with voting in favor of bill they believe will be helpful, while it’s chock-full of other provisions that they disagree with. “This is ripping my heart out because there’s things in this bill that just don’t belong there,” said Rep. David Schweikert, R-Ariz., “I consider them”, then the GOP rep stopped himself. “Well, I can’t say that word in front of a microphone.” Schweikert, however, argued Congress must “do the right thing” by passing the legislation. However, Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., said he'll oppose the legislation over cost and debt concerns. ""As President Trump said, we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself,"" Buck said.

Steve Daines, R-Montana, and his staff have facilitated numerous emergency repatriation flights for U.S. citizens trapped abroad amid the growing coronavirus pandemic -- including a last-minute escape from Africa that highlights the risks for the thousands of Americans still stuck away from home, Fox News has learned. The pandemic has infected more than 400,000 people around the world and killed over 20,000. International lockdowns have led stranded travelers to reach out to lawmakers to cut through bureaucratic red tape, often with just minutes to spare. Pastor Mark Arbaugh, who had been stuck in Lima, Peru, told Fox News early Friday morning that he was one of those fortunate escapees in large part because of his hometown senator. ""Senator Daines' office was very helpful to us,"" Arbaugh said in a text message to Fox News while onboard his red-eye repatriation flight into Washington, D.C. He was traveling with several Montana Tech students.

Wally worked hard at making sure that my group of 4 and our new friends that were stranded from Atlanta in the same hotel with us got on the same manifest,"" Arbaugh added. Arbaugh said he had never met Daines or anyone in his office before, but worked closely with them during the ordeal. As for the situation in Peru, Arbaugh observed that ""a lot of people are gonna have a tough time getting out"" now that the national quarantine there has been extended to April 12. But, Arbaugh said, he was looking forward to returning to the country when the situation stabilizes. Separately, U.S. Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates John Rakolta was recorded Friday debriefing five Montanan evacuees at Abu Dhabi Airport ahead of their repatriation flight to the U.S. -- saying it was ""no easy task to move from one airport to another without a visa,"" and that Daines, as well as foreign government officials and embassy workers, had ""moved mountains"" to get them back home amid ""very trying times."" ""I'm happy you're all able to get home; I know it's been at trying and stressful time,"" the ambassador said. ""I got my first phone call about three days ago from the senator from Montana [Daines], who called and said there were five young men stuck in the airport, didn't have food or water, and had their passports confiscated. And everyone was really worried. So the embassy was able to marshal some resources very quickly."" WATCH BELOW: UAE AMBASSADOR DEBRIEFS EVACUEES ON RESPONSE BY EMBASSY, DAINES, FOREIGN OFFICIALS Meanwhile, Isaac Sturgeon, 31, told Fox News that his return to the U.S. on Saturday night from Morocco came as military vehicles were preparing to enforce a strict curfew and shut down international travel indefinitely because of the virus. ""I just wanted to be back on American soil,"" Sturgeon told Fox News, who was traveling for skydiving instruction. ""I registered with the embassy ... There was a lot of silence for a couple days; I don't think they were use to this kind of high volume of phone calls and people at the gates."" That's when Sturgeon said his father ""decided to try to get a hold of Steve Daines directly."" Afterward, Sturgeon said, things moved quickly. Daines' office contacted the State Department to charter a flight for Americans when commercial flights were canceled. Once that was approved, Daines made the request to reserve a seat for Isaac. WATCH BELOW: VIDEO FROM STURGEON'S FLIGHT HOME ""I'm sure all the pressure helped a lot,"" Sturgeon said, referring to the senator's outreach. Ahead of the flight, the U.S. embassy ""emailed me and said get to the airport between 12:30 to 5:30, flights were leaving; go to front counter and show them your passport and they'll assign you a seat on one of those airplanes,"" Sturgeon said. WILL CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS BILL BE DELAYED? At the airport, Strugeon said tents had been set up by the U.S. embassy to help travelers who needed to sleep at the airport so they didn't miss a flight. Strugeon said once he landed, his temperature was taken and he had forms to fill out concerning his possible exposure to coronavirus. Strugeon received what he called ""wonderful"" help not only from Daines and his staff -- ""Liz [Dellwo] was great,"" and Daines himself was ""kind and humble,"" he said -- but also from British Airways, who flew him from Marrakesh to London.

The airline staff said they didn't know they were coming to get us until 5 a.m. that morning. Great spirit, complimentary snacks."" He added that he hasn't yet even had to pay for the flight. For those still stuck abroad, Strugeon had some advice: ""You've got to get on the horn, talk to people, be sociable to find out what the word is."" ""Especially in a foreign country you have to take matters into your own hands, be hyperproductive and find out what's going on,"" he continued. ""You have to care for your own life in a crisis; even in America you have to have common sense -- not everyone can help you. The government can't always be there for just you -- - you're not as special as you think. There's 350 million Americans our government has to take care of.""

At the same time, he said he benefited tremendously throughout the ordeal by linking up with another American from Colorado and joining a Facebook group full of other U.S. citizens in Africa. In an Instagram post, Strugeon sounded a celebratory note in mid-air: ""After an Evac flight out of North Africa 48 hours before boder closings, ...... im Home.

Other Montanans who have worked with Daines' office to secure release include Dale Brevik, who was stranded on an expedition cruise ship after it was denied disembarking in Argentina, as well as Matt Vincent and his family, who had been in Ecuador. Daines' office is additionally working to secure the release of other Americans abroad, including Necia Erickson in Cusco, Peru, and a slew of students in Huanchaco, Peru. “I’m so glad to hear that Pastor Mark and the Montana Tech students will be returning to Montana today and I wish them safe travels as they make it home,"" Daines told Fox News. He added that he was happy to have ""helped Isaac return to the U.S. from being stuck abroad during this time."" ""I wish Isaac and his family well, and look forward to hearing about their reunion. Welcome home, Isaac!” Daines said. ""I continue to work around the clock to bring other Montanans home stuck abroad.” Peru has posed numerous high-profile challenges for Americans abroad. In one extreme case, a 33-year-old American woman running out of her life-saving medication to treat her auto-immune disease finally boarded a flight home Wednesday after being stuck in Peru for about 10 days, but hundreds of other U.S. citizens remained stranded after the South American nation closed its borders due to the coronavirus pandemic.

"                          With the coronavirus relief package being the costliest stimulus measure in U.S. history, it is set to also include funding for provisions that do not directly help deal with the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.

You must appear to be totally oblivious of the context or complexities of anything your enemies might say or do. It’s not just that you aren’t giving them the benefit of the doubt, you must selectively hear and see only the worst.President Trump doesn’t want to get the economy restarted as soon as possible, he wants to kill thousands of Americans for mere mammon. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi doesn’t want to take every reasonable precaution against a pandemic, she wants to destroy the American economy to hurt Trump.Sheesh.That’s not to say that there are not serious, fundamental disagreements between the left and right on the response to the coronavirus, but on this issue there are less serious disagreements than there are on many, if not most, of the more ordinary issues facing the nation.Now, before you tell us about the very, very terrible thing that some kook in Congress said or about the blatherskite being peddled by a gasbag talking head or the outrageous thing posted on the internet by someone snuffling for clicks like a pig for truffles, we should point out that we are talking about normal people – not those who profit by division.Polls show an impressive degree of national unity on the seriousness of the matter at hand – 92 percent in the latest Fox News poll – and overwhelming support for quarantine measures and various relief efforts. Trump’s job approval matches his all-time high and congressional job approval hasn’t been this good in more than a decade.   But our politicians and pundits have so much gotten into the habit of being facile – intentionally obtuse – that they can’t bring themselves to listen and see, even when voters send clear signals for cooperation.That word, “facile,” is so perfect for American politicians today because of its roots. The origin is from the Latin “facillis,” for “easy.” It is easier to win elections, raise money and generate clicks, views and likes if you pretend not to understand that things are hard and complicated.This is hardly a new phenomenon. Straw man arguments have been around longer than straw men. But what was once reserved for the heat of campaign season is now the default – so much so that when we need to cooperate, we find the muscles have atrophied.The debates around coronavirus are not either/or, they are how much/how little, how soon/how late, here/there… These are prudential questions in which individual Americans and our leaders must use their best judgment to decide the safest courses of action and do so with very little information available.That hardly sounds like the time to be facile or pretend that there are simple or easy answers. It sounds more like a time to show grace and understanding for each other.We are heading into the third week since America’s Friday the 13th shutdown. It may be Good Friday, two weeks from now, before we can start to gradually, region-by-region start getting back to normal. For some places, like New York and its surroundings, it may be much longer.Congress has done its part, the administration has been in overdrive, local and state officials are doing everything they can. Medical professionals are, at grave risk to themselves, fighting on the front lines. The battle is well joined. Everything else will have to wait.For the next two weeks, there may not be a great deal to argue about, at least for those still willing or able to listen. Let’s hope that in this time of prayerful anticipation, more of us rediscover the power of understanding.THE RULEBOOK: YOU’RE SO VAIN“It is in vain to oppose constitutional barriers to the impulse of self-preservation. It is worse than in vain; because it plants in the Constitution itself necessary usurpations of power, every precedent of which is a germ of unnecessary and multiplied repetitions.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 41TIME OUT: HERE’S TO SIG JAKUCKIBaseball Hall of Fame: “With a war raging overseas and uncertainty overwhelming the nation, a unique World Series was taking place pitting two teams who shared the same home ballpark. The 1944 World Series, considered a David versus Goliath matchup at the time, was an all-St. Louis affair featuring the prodigious Cardinals, a franchise having just won its third consecutive National League pennant, and the plucky Browns, the winners of its first American League pennant in its 43rd year of existence. The Cinderella story Browns, who had only one winning campaign in the previous 14 seasons, finishing with an 82-69 record in 1942. In the end, Goliath won the ’44 World Series in six games….  And in a story that was typical of wartime baseball, 35-year-old righty Sig Jakucki, who hadn’t played affiliated ball since 1938, won 13 games for the Browns, which included the pennant-winner on the final day of the season.”Flag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARDESTIMATED DELEGATES FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATIONBiden: 1,217Sanders: 914[Ed. note: 1,991 delegates needed to win]TRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE Average approval: 47.4 percentAverage disapproval: 48.2 percentNet Score: -0.8 percentChange from one week ago: ↑ 7.2 points[Average includes: ABC News/WaPo: 49% approve - 47% disapprove; Fox News: 48% approve - 51% disapprove; Gallup: 49% approve - 45% disapprove; Monmouth University: 48% approve - 48% disapprove; NPR/PBS News/Marist: 43% approve - 50% disapprove.]MAJORITY APPROVES OF TRUMP’S CRISIS MANAGEMENT Fox News: “President Trump’s overall job approval ticks up, while large numbers of Democrats and Republicans approve of infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci. … The number of Republicans feeling ‘nervous’ about the economy is up 26 points. Voters split over whether Trump’s response to the outbreak is appropriate, while one quarter feel most Americans are ‘overreacting.’ … Approval of Trump’s overall job performance is up one point since February to 48 percent, while 51 percent disapprove. That puts him underwater by 3 points. Last month, his rating was 47 approve-52 disapprove (-5).  His best marks were in February 2017, when he had a net positive rating by one point (48-47). The uptick comes from a record 16 percent of Democrats approving of Trump, up from a previous high of 14 percent. And approval among women matches an earlier record 43 percent. When asked specifically about responses to the coronavirus outbreak, 51 percent of voters approve of Trump and 46 percent disapprove.  The federal government overall (55-41) and Vice President Mike Pence (55-37) receive similar ratings.”Trump gets a bump, but it’s modest - WaPo: “On the political front, President Trump narrowly wins approval for his handling of the outbreak, and his overall approval rating has grown five percentage points since February, to 48 percent, even as most Americans say he was too slow to take action in the early days of the virus’s spread. The rise in Trump’s approval rating, however, is far smaller than some other presidents have experienced in times of national crisis. … Trump’s approval rise may represent a rally effect, in which Americans grow more supportive of a president during a national crisis. After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, President George W. Bush’s approval rating surged from 55 percent to 86 percent in Post-ABC polling. His ratings stayed above 60 percent for most of the next two years and he won reelection in 2004.”LEADERS SCRAMBLE TO BLOCK RECORDED BAILOUT VOTEFox News: “Congressional leaders scrambled Friday to stall a rogue GOP lawmaker's last-ditch attempt to force a prolonged, roll-call vote on the massive $2 trillion coronavirus response package, which is all but certain to pass in the end. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., signaled Friday morning that he would indeed demand a roll-call vote. ‘I swore an oath to uphold the constitution, and I take that oath seriously. In a few moments I will request a vote on the CARES Act which means members of Congress will vote on it by pushing ‘yes’ or ‘no’ or ‘present,’’ he tweeted. … But House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy nevertheless signaled he’s got an exit strategy, insisting to reporters that they can pass the bill without a roll-call vote. … resuming there is a quorum, members could still oppose the roll-call vote -- prompting a simple voice vote.”Who is Thomas Massie? - Roll Call: “Rep. Thomas Massie, a conservative libertarian Republican from Kentucky, has attracted the ire of his congressional colleagues and President Donald Trump, who urged his party Friday to ‘throw Massie out’ of the GOP. Massie’s opposition to a $2 trillion economic relief package aimed at stabilizing the nation’s economy through the tumult of the coronavirus pandemic forced lawmakers to return to the Capitol Friday. Leaders of both parties had been hoping to pass the measure on a voice vote, but Massie has indicated he may request a roll call vote. Massie, like Trump, took to Twitter to explain his views and confirming that he would request a roll call vote, despite the pressure from both sides of the aisle and the White House not to. ‘I am not delaying the bill like Nancy Pelosi did last week,’ he wrote, referring to the House Speaker. ‘The bill that was worked on in the Senate late last week was much better before Speaker Pelosi showed up to destroy it and add days and days to the process.’”Continetti: Corona Conservatism - Free Beacon: “What the moment requires is some intellectual modesty. It is far too early in the development of this national emergency to make definitive judgments on its political, economic, social, and cultural effects. We might as well explore alternative scenarios. For example: The coronavirus might not signify a conclusion to or beginning of a historical era, so much as an acceleration of previously germinating inclinations. This quickening is most visible in the United States Senate. It was the youthful and heterodox members of the Republican conference who first recognized the severity of the challenges emanating from Wuhan, China. As Congress put together its economic relief bill, these lawmakers did not worry about violating free-market dogma. They recognized the extraordinary nature of the situation.”PLAY-BY-PLAYTrump initiated phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping Friday - WSJAUDIBLE: HOW SWEET IT IS “Dr. Fauci doughnuts are selling like hotcakes at Donuts Delite” – The headline of an article  from the Rochester [N.Y.] Democrat and Chronicle.

There’s serious constitutional doubt about whether the capital could be in a state, but the District of Columbia is not in doubt on the statehood question. It is overwhelmingly supported.

"                           New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Friday emphasized his desire for tens of thousands of new ventilators to treat an increasing number of coronavirus patients after President Trump downplayed the number a day earlier. ""The people are on ventilators much later than most patients are on ventilators,"" Cuomo said of coronavirus patients who experience serious complications from the disease in a press conference Friday. ""Most people are on a ventilator for two, three, four days. These [coronavirus] patients can come in and need a ventilator for up to 20 days, so you see how that need for ventilators is so important."" Trump appeared on Fox News Thursday night for an interview with Sean Hannity on the coronavirus crisis. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW CUOMO: SENATE'S $2 TRILLION CORONAVIRUS BILL WOULD BE 'TERRIBLE' FOR NEW YORK ""I don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators,"" Trump said on ""Hannity"" Thursday night in an apparent reference to Cuomo's recent claim that the state needed 30,000 ventilators. ""You know, you go into major hospitals sometimes and they'll have two ventilators and now all of a sudden they're saying, 'Can we order 30,000 ventilators?'"" After being asked about Trump's comments Friday, Cuomo responded by saying his state's coronavirus response is based on facts and data. ""Well, maybe you don’t need 30,000,"" Cuomo said, seemingly paraphrasing the president's remarks. ""Well, look, I don’t have a crystal ball, everybody’s entitled to their own opinion. But I don’t operate here on opinion. I operate on facts and on data and on numbers and on projections."" He continued: ""All the projections say you could have an apex needing 140,000 beds and about 40,000 ventilators ... And that’s what the data and the science says. I hope we don’t need 30,000 ventilators. I hope some natural weather change happens overnight and kills the virus globally... The numbers say you may need 30,000."" The president also hammered another Democratic governor who criticized the federal government's response to the pandemic, specifically on the federal government's slow response in helping states acquire ventilators for their hospitals. ""The first line of attack is supposed to be the hospitals and the local government and the states -- the states themselves,"" Trump told Hannity. ""We have people like [Washington state] Governor [Jay] Inslee -- he should be doing more."" The president did praise Cuomo on his response to the coronavirus pandemic in his ""Hannity"" appearance Thursday, as he has before. Cuomo has also complimented Trump on the federal government's coronavirus response efforts, although he has been critical of Trump at times. The governor this week lambasted the $2.2 trillion coronavirus response bill -- which is backed by congressional Republicans and Democrats, as well as President Trump -- as ""terrible"" for his state. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""New York City only gets $1.3 billion from this package, that is a drop in the bucket as to need,"" Cuomo said on Thursday. Cuomo indicated that he does still have a good working relationship with the president and would ask him for additional help in the state's coronavirus response Friday. ""I'm going to ask the president today if he will authorize another four temporary hospitals for us,"" the governor said. For his part, Trump on Friday called on General Motors to open abandoned plants to start making ventilators. He also called on Ford to make the machines, too.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. The Chinese government is accusing the United States of engaging in “malicious fabrication” over its efforts to get the U.N. Security Council to state explicitly that the coronavirus pandemic began in Wuhan, China -- part of an escalating battle between the two countries on the matter. NBC News first reported Thursday that talks at the council over a joint declaration or resolution on the global pandemic have stalled over the U.S. demand that it explicitly name Wuhan as the source of the virus. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION URGES UN SECURITY COUNCIL TO STATE CORONAVIRUS ORIGINATED IN CHINA  A source with knowledge of the situation confirmed to Fox News that the U.S. suggested language that would name Wuhan, China, and that the Chinese were unhappy about the push. “All members of the Security Council must recognize the threat that China’s mishandling of the outbreak poses to international peace and security,” a State Department official later told Fox News. “The People’s Republic of China has been more interested in saving face than saving lives.” The Chinese Mission to the U.N., when asked by Fox News about the effort, said on Thursday that it was “astonished by the choice of the United States to use whatever venue and opportunity for politicizing the COVID-19 and blaming China, which we strongly oppose.” “The groundless accusations and malicious fabrication from the United States aim at shirking its own responsibilities, which severely poisoned the atmosphere of the global cooperation in containing the outbreak,” a spokesperson said. “We strongly urge the United States to stop such irresponsible practices and listen to the voice of the American people. The United States should indeed shoulder its responsibilities to save lives instead of going further down the wrong path.” The U.S. State Department official said on Thursday that the U.S. backs a resolution that would praise first responders and medical personnel and reinforce the importance of international cooperation, as well as the need for all member states to act quickly and with full transparency to end the pandemic. It would also back a resolution that demands a pause to all hostilities to enable the international community to quickly tackle the spread of the virus. But the official also noted that, since the virus broke in China, Beijing has a “special responsibility” to be fully transparent about the virus: “Instead they suppressed information and punished doctors and journalists who raised the alarm.” TRUMP SAYS US WORKING CLOSELY WITH CHINA ON CORONAVIRUS AFTER CALL WITH XI “We call on PRC authorities to provide accurate and prompt public health reporting, timely access to all relevant information, and respect for freedom of expression so that lessons learned, best practices, and innovations can be shared freely between peoples to facilitate the most globally effective response to minimize deaths,” the official said. President Trump has repeatedly named the coronavirus “the Chinese virus” and has blamed the Chinese for its “secretive” approach in the early days of the crisis. That was after Chinese officials began dabbling in conspiracy theories that the U.S. Army was the cause of the virus. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But Trump has also taken a conciliatory approach to Chinese President Xi Jinping, with whom he says he has a good relationship. ""Just finished a very good conversation with President Xi of China. Discussed in great detail the CoronaVirus that is ravaging large parts of our Planet. China has been through much & has developed a strong understanding of the Virus. We are working closely together. Much respect,"" Trump tweeted Friday.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. Former Secretary of State John Kerry blasted GOP Rep. Thomas Massie on Friday in colorful terms over his possible bid to delay a vote on the coronavirus stimulus package, saying he has “tested positive for being an a--hole.” The House is expected to vote as early as Friday on the more than $2 trillion package, and it is widely expected to pass with bipartisan support despite Massie's objections. “Breaking news: Congressman Massie has tested positive for being an a--hole. He must be quarantined to prevent the spread of his massive stupidity,” Kerry tweeted. “He’s given new meaning to the term #M-sshole.” Kerry added: ""Finally, something the president and I can agree on!” HOUSE DEBATES CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS BILL AS GOP REP FACES BACKLASH OVER THREAT TO FORCE RECORDED VOTE Kerry’s tweet came in response to President Trump likewise slamming Massie, R-Ky., saying he should be thrown out of the GOP. “Looks like a third rate Grandstander named @RepThomasMassie, a Congressman from, unfortunately, a truly GREAT State, Kentucky, wants to vote against the new Save Our Workers Bill in Congress. He just wants the publicity,” Trump tweeted Friday morning. The president later replied to Kerry, saying: ""Never knew John Kerry had such a good sense of humor! Very impressed!"" The House initially planned to pass the coronavirus stimulus package by unanimous consent or voice vote with a skeleton crew of legislators present in order to minimize the risk of spreading the coronavirus among its members. The body, under its rules, can pass legislation by unanimous consent – with no representative in the chamber objecting – or a voice vote — an exercise in which those for and against a bill yell yea or nay, and the loudest side wins. But either method can be shut down by a ""point of order"" from a member who could argue a lack of quorum, meaning less than half of the House's total members are present in the chamber. At that point, it would need at least 216 total members present to hold a recorded vote. Massie has indicated to House leaders, despite significant efforts from Republican leadership, that he may force a recorded vote by suggesting the lack of quorum. House leadership is also concerned a handful of other members –Republicans and Democrats – might be considering taking the same action. Massie on Thursday night noted that the coronavirus bill, with about $2 trillion of new spending and $4 trillion of stimulus via monetary policy from the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve, equated to ""$60,000 per family of new national debt and dollar devaluation in this stimulus.” He also said in an interview with 55 KRC radio Thursday morning that he was interested in following the letter of the Constitution rather than a workaround in the House's rules. ""I'm having a really hard time with this. Because they're saying, well it's hard to travel, yadda yadda yadda,"" Massie said. ""Well, last night, 96 out of 100 Senators voted. All we would need is 218 out of 435 to vote,"" he added, pointing to a section of Article I in the U.S. Constitution that states ""a majority of each [body of the legislature] shall constitute a quorum to do business."" Massie’s potential move has forced House members to return to D.C. in time for a Friday vote. The recorded vote may be put off until Saturday, though, if the House cannot reach a quorum and one is demanded.

"                          A little more than 100 years before the coronavirus outbreak, the world was in the grips of the Spanish Flu, which was believed to have infected about one third of the global population at the time.

He's sheltering in place now in his suburban New York home. And he's 106. He survived the last major global ‎pandemic.  MORE THAN 100 YEARS BEFORE CORONAVIRUS, THE SPANISH FLU PANDEMIC RAVAGED THE GLOBE That one infected 500 million people around the world and killed some 50 million, 675,000 in the U.S. ‎American cities were especially hard-hit, including Pittsburgh, Penn. The city of just over half-a-million at the time saw 4,500 deaths from the virus and 24,000 reported cases. And Dad was one of them.  CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE       Edward Palkot with his mother Mamie and father John.      (Greg Palkot) Edward was 5 years old. According to him, he probably contracted the “dreaded disease” from his “playmates.” Unlike the current COVID-19, the Spanish flu hit younger people harder than the elderly.  “Those who drank whiskey escaped the flu,” Dad recalls his mother Mamie suggesting, “those who did not, succumbed.”     In fact, Dad’s mother and father were fine. Ed, the only child at the time, got the attention. Pittsburgh's mayor reluctantly followed guidance from Pennsylvania authorities to close public spaces, so the virus came with a vengeance. The city scrambled to set up makeshift hospitals. People crowded in, struggled to breathe, their lungs filling with liquid. There were no respirators then. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW       Edward Palkot with caregiver, Tina      (Greg Palkot) Dad's “dear” mother luckily decided to keep him at home, providing him with “careful nursing.” His room was simple but cozy, warmed by a gas space heater. Edward was attended to by the Palkot family GP, Dr. Frederick. House calls then cost a lordly sum of two dollars. It was worth it. “His skillful treatment,” Dad remembers, “saved my life.” Others in Pittsburgh weren’t so lucky.    At the Spanish flu’s peak, people were dying in the city at the rate of 100 a day.  “The procession of horse-drawn hearses seemed to continue endlessly,” he said. Most of the wakes were at home, not funeral homes.  “You learned of a death by a wreathe at the door — purple for older people, white for the young.”   When the death rate increased, Dad recalled, just plain flowers were used.  After a week or so, Edward recovered. In fact, after several weeks the worst of the Spanish flu had passed through the city.         Greg Palkot and his father, Thanksgiving 2019      (Greg Palkot) The best therapy to get the remnants of the flu out of Dad’s lungs? According to trusted Dr. Frederick, playing outside. Mother Mamie was “perplexed,” little Ed was “elated.” Fast-forward a century or so, and Dad is now living through another pandemic, COVID-19. Literally hundreds of cases all around his home. He's getting by with the help of family, including my two sisters nearby. And perhaps most importantly right now, hard-working caregiver Tina, who lives with him and pretty much plays the role of Dad’s late mother.

"                          With the coronavirus relief package being the costliest stimulus measure in U.S. history, it is set to also include funding for provisions that do not directly help deal with the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. Here’s what you should know about the $11 billion fund included in the package. Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif., announced on Twitter Friday morning that she tested negative for the coronavirus after self-quarantining Wednesday when she fell ill with flu-like symptoms. Porter said she will remain home in California because she is still ill and needs rest, even if she is not sick with the coronavirus, which causes a disease officially known as COVID-19. ""My COVID-19 test came back negative, which is a relief,"" she said. ""I am still staying home, because I have symptoms and need to recover; this means I will not be able to travel to Washington, DC to vote."" CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW HOUSE DEBATES CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS BILL AS GOP REP FACES BACKLASH OVER THREAT TO FORCE RECORDED VOTE Porter made sure to note her support for the coronavirus stimulus package being debated on the House floor Friday morning ahead of a likely vote on the $2.2 trillion bill. A recorded vote could be pushed to Saturday as lawmakers scramble to Washington, D.C., after indications from Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., that he could nix the House's original plan to pass the measure by unanimous consent or voice vote with just a handful of members present rather than the 216 required for the body to have a quorum. ""I support the CARES Act, a relief package that will bring critical resources to help families and small businesses in our community,"" she said. ""I will be providing more information about this bill to you and will continue to work with our community and my colleagues to address the pandemic."" Rep. Ben McAdams, D-Utah, and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., among other members of Congress, have contracted the coronavirus. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP McAdams was hospitalized a week ago with breathing issues related to his coronavirus diagnosis and remained in the hospital as recently as Tuesday. He also voiced support for the stimulus bill on Thursday. The legislation passed the Senate 96-0 and is expected to pass the House overwhelmingly, even if that means the chamber is forced to hold a recorded vote. ""The #coronavirus relief bill, the #CARESAct, helps Utah working families and businesses,"" McAdams said. ""While supporting those in need, we also must keep careful oversight on how tax dollars are spent.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. The House of Representatives on Friday moved toward a vote on the massive $2.2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package aimed at reducing the spread of the disease and keeping Americans financially afloat as businesses shut down to limit social contact according to guidelines from the federal and state governments. But it came as one GOP lawmaker was poised to hold up proceedings -- and he faced scorching criticism from his colleagues and the White House over that scenario. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., signaled Friday morning that he would indeed demand a roll-call vote. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW “I swore an oath to uphold the constitution, and I take that oath seriously. In a few moments I will request a vote on the CARES Act which means members of Congress will vote on it by pushing ‘yes’ or ‘no’ or ‘present,’” he tweeted. He indicated he wants to ensure there is a quorum, which would require half of the members to show up on Capitol Hill. But House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy nevertheless signaled he’s got an exit strategy, insisting to reporters that they can pass the bill without a roll-call vote. He did not explain how. Amid the drama, House members debated the measure on the floor. ""We must take swift action to ensure that people can stay home to slow the spread of this deadly virus and that our economy can be supported so it can rebound when the medical experts and scientists say it is safe to do so,"" House Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer said as he kicked off three hours of debate on the measure. Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, also urged the House to approve the bill as quickly as possible. ""While no one will agree with every part of this rescue bill, we face a challenge rarely seen in America's history,"" he said. ""We must act now or the toll on lives and livelihoods will be far greater. I strongly urge its passage."" The House initially planned to pass the coronavirus stimulus package by unanimous consent or voice vote with a skeleton crew of legislators present in order to minimize the risk of spreading the coronavirus among its members. The body, under its rules, can pass legislation by unanimous consent -- with no representative in the chamber objecting -- or a voice vote -- an exercise in which those for and against a bill yell yea or nay, and the loudest side wins. CORONAVIRUS PACKAGE CONTAINS $11 BILLION FOR THREE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS But either method can be shut down by a ""point of order"" from a member who could argue a lack of quorum, meaning less than half of the House's total members are present in the chamber. At that point, it would need at least 216 total members present to hold a recorded vote. Rep. Massie, R-Ky., has indicated to House leaders, despite significant arm-twisting efforts from Republican leadership, that he will force a recorded vote by suggesting the lack of quorum. House leadership is also concerned a handful of other members -- Republicans and Democrats -- might be considering taking the same action. Massie faced an intense backlash from colleagues and even President Trump over the threat, with the president mocking him Friday morning as a “third rate Grandstander.” “He just wants the publicity. He can’t stop it, only delay, which is both dangerous...& costly,” Trump tweeted, before urging Republicans to win back the House but “throw Massie out of Republican Party!” On Fox News’ “American Newsroom,” New York Democratic Rep. Max Rose called Massie’s potential delay “disgusting” and “inhumane.” He went so far as to call him “un-American” and say he’d have “blood” on his hands with any further delay. Massie on Thursday night noted that the coronavirus bill, with about $2 trillion of new spending and $4 trillion of stimulus via monetary policy from the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve, equated to ""$60,000 per family of new national debt and dollar devaluation in this stimulus."" He also said in an interview with 55 KRC radio Thursday morning that he was interested in following the letter of the Constitution rather than a workaround in the House's rules. ""I'm having a really hard time with this. Because they're saying, well it's hard to travel, yadda yadda yadda,"" Massie said. ""Well, last night, 96 out of 100 Senators voted. All we would need is 218 out of 435 to vote,"" he added, pointing to a section of Article I in the U.S. Constitution that states ""a majority of each [body of the legislature] shall constitute a quorum to do business."" This has led to a mad scramble among some frustrated House members to return to D.C. in time to vote on Friday. The recorded vote might be put off until Saturday if the House cannot reach a quorum and one is demanded. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP On Friday morning, Speaker Nancy Pelosi noted that the House would have several hours of debate. As for whether there would be a roll call vote, she said they’d have to see. The House came to order seconds after 9 a.m. ET, with lawmakers expecting floor debate on the coronavirus stimulus before attempting to vote on the bill, which passed the Senate 96-0. The bill is also expected to pass overwhelmingly in the House, even if Massie or another member scuttles the effort to vote on the bill by voice vote or unanimous consent. “You might have one grandstander,” President Trump said at a coronavirus press conference on Thursday. “It will pass. It will just take a little longer.""

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.  Sign up here. The House of Representatives on Friday overwhelmingly approved a more than $2 trillion package to combat the coronavirus pandemic and send economic relief to workers and businesses squeezed by restrictions meant to stop the outbreak’s spread. The legislation, approved by voice vote despite 11th-hour drama arising from a GOP lawmaker’s objections, amounts to the costliest stimulus plan in U.S. history. It includes checks for most Americans, boosted unemployment aid, help for small business as well as a massive loan fund for corporations – at a time when unemployment is surging at a record pace, a consequence of businesses closing in compliance with social distancing guidelines. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW The bill, already approved by the Senate, now goes to President Trump's desk. “This bill is not only a rescue package, it is a commitment...that your government and the people whom you elected to serve will do everything we can to limit the harm and hardship you face, both now and in the foreseeable future,” House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said prior to the vote.  ""To the American public: If you do your part, I promise we will do ours."" The approval, while widely anticipated, followed a stretch of uncertainty over whether one congressman -- concerned about the stunning cost of the package -- might be able to stall the vote. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., had furiously objected to a simple voice vote that would have required only a minimal number of lawmakers to travel. Massie, as part of his push, wanted to ensure there is a quorum, which would require half of the members to show up on Capitol Hill. So as President Trump and others accused him of grandstanding, hundreds of lawmakers were summoned to Washington D.C. Thursday night and Friday morning from coronavirus-ravaged communities in New York, California and elsewhere. This, despite strict guidelines from the Capitol physician advising lawmakers not to congregate at the Capitol and to stay in their offices until needed to avoid the spread of the virus that has already infected several lawmakers. While Massie was able to ensure many lawmakers showed up for the vote, he was not, in the end, able to force a roll-call. The House, after several hours of debate, ultimately passed the measure by voice vote, and it was allowed to stand. There were loud cries for ‘ayes’ and few rumblings of ‘nos’ on the House floor. “The ayes have it,” declared the presiding officer Rep. Anthony Brown, D-Md. But Massie stood up and objected. “I came here to make sure our republic doesn’t die by unanimous consent in an empty chamber and I request a recorded vote,” Massie said. Brown ruled that an insufficient number of lawmakers stood in support of a roll call vote. But Massie pressed on. “I object on the basis that a quorum is not present,” Massie said, instructing a count of lawmakers. “A quorum is present and the motion is adopted,” Brown ruled, to applause. Minutes before the vote, Speaker Nancy Pelosi took to the floor to summon social-distancing lawmakers at the Capitol in an effort to gather quorum and shut down the Massie effort. Pelosi touted the aid forthcoming for hospitals, Americans and small businesses, while acknowledging that more needs to be done for the frontline healthcare workers and paying homage to a New York nurse who died while serving at a hospital that didn’t have enough gowns. “We know that this cannot be our final bill,” Pelosi said. In a series of speeches prior to the historic rescue bill, lawmakers pressed for national unity despite the bill's imperfections. “We're going to help Americans through this,"" McCarthy said. ""We're going to do this together and in the end, we are going to be healthier, stronger and more united than ever before, because as Americans, that's who we are.” Upon catching wind of the plan to stop a roll-call vote, though, Massie howled on Twitter over the parliamentary machinations. ""It’s pretty clear now, with enough members here to pass the bill, that Pelosi and McCarthy are still working together to block a recorded vote just to insulate members of Congress from ACCOUNTABILITY. Biggest spending bill in the history of mankind, and no recorded vote? #SWAMP,"" he tweeted. After the voice vote, Massie accused Pelosi and McCarthy of trying to shield their members from the political ramifications. ""There's a big cover up in there,"" Massie said as he exited the Capitol. Emotions ran hot on the House floor all morning Friday before the vote on the $2 trillion stimulus bill. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., started her impassioned floor speech by noting 13 people died in one day at Queen’s Elmhurst Hospital and medical professionals still don’t have enough ventilators and personal protection equipment. She ripped the Senate for fighting for corporate bailouts that will contribute to the income inequality gap in order for families to get “crumbs.” “What did the Senate majority fight for? One of the largest corporate bailouts with as few strings as possible in American history. Shameful!” Ocasio-Cortez said. On the other side of the aisle, Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., said he’s “distressed by the Hobson’s choice"" lawmakers face of having to accept unrelated spending sprees in order to send relief. “No more billion-dollar bailouts for things that are unrelated. No more policies that are long-standing for a short-standing issue that needs our critical attention,” Perry said. In a bizarre and seemingly unnecessary point of drama, Rep. Haley Stevens, D-Mich., refused to stop speaking when her time ran out on the House floor, even though Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., was willing to let her finish if she had just paused to let him officially grant her more time. Instead, Stevens continued yelling and held up her hands – clad with pink surgical gloves—in an apparent homage to front line healthcare workers fighting the coronavirus pandemic even though her mic was cut. As the presiding officer was pounding the gavel and ruling Stevens “out of order,” Stevens screamed, “do not be afraid!” Republicans, who are trying hard to flip the freshman rep’s seat in November, immediately pounced on the outburst as a “meltdown.” The bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion-plus annual federal budget. The $2.2 trillion estimate is the White House's best guess of the spending it contains. The legislation would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year and $2,400 to a married couple making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child. Unemployment insurance would be made far more generous, with $600 per week tacked onto regular state jobless payments through the end of July. States and local governments would receive $150 billion in supplemental funding to help them provide basic and emergency services during the crisis. The legislation also establishes a $454 billion program for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries in hopes of leveraging up to $4.5 trillion in lending to distressed businesses, states, and municipalities. All would be up to the Treasury Department's discretion, though businesses controlled by Trump or immediate family members and by members of Congress would be ineligible. There was also $150 billion devoted to the health care system, including $100 billion for grants to hospitals and other health care providers buckling under the strain of COVID-19 caseloads. Frustrations were already hot as lawmakers had to return to Washington in a panic after Massie, R-Ky., threatened to upend plans for a simple voice vote with as few lawmakers as possible. “To you who oppose this bill: Please, please stand down,"" Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., pleaded on the House floor.  ""We can't wait another day to help. Don't add to this disruption by, in fact, being a disruptor. Be a leader."" Lawmakers spoke passionately about how COVID-19 is hurting the health of their communities and how the widespread shutdown of the economy is crippling families and businesses. Yet many openly grappled with voting in favor of bill they believe will be helpful, while it’s chock-full of other provisions that they disagree with. “This is ripping my heart out because there’s things in this bill that just don’t belong there. I consider them--,"" Rep. David Schweikert, R-Ariz., said, stopping himself midsentence. “Well, I can’t say that word in front of a microphone.” Schweikert, however, argued Congress must “do the right thing” by passing the legislation. However, Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., said he opposed the legislation over cost and debt concerns. ""As President Trump said, we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself,"" Buck said.

MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell said Friday that he decided to start making face masks to aid in the fight against the deadly coronavirus (COVID-19) because his passion has always been to help others. Appearing on ""America's Newsroom"" with host Ed Henry, Lindell said that he couldn't think of a better time to do so. CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE ""We started then to find out what we could make,"" he said. ""We worked with the administration. They have a coalition to what kind of masks are need out there. Obviously, we specialize in cotton and we found out different materials that they didn't want -- latex...and stuff. So, finally, we got the final prototype three days ago."" Lindell said it took MyPillow workers three days to turn over a 200,000-square-foot factory into a facility to produce the masks. They are currently making about 10,000 a day and aim to produce up to 50,000 a day. ""And, we're doing the shipping. I'm shipping them out,"" he continued. ""That's what we do at MyPillow. So, a lot of this just fell right in line with what we do. And, I've also switched over other companies. I want every other manufacturer -- see what you can do out there."" In addition, Lindell told Henry that his factories in Connecticut, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Minnesota are also converting to help the effort. ""It takes one person eight hours a day. We have to do them by hand. You can only make like 100 to 120. So, the bottleneck is just getting people, you know, to do it,"" he remarked, adding that all workers are six feet apart as well as implementing other safety precautions.

""And, I want to continue into the future -- once this ends -- we want, like the president says, we want our manufacturers here in the USA. Especially, we've learned, our medical supplies. ""We don't want 90 percent coming in from overseas. We want to make them right here and we're going to learn from this,"" he concluded.

"                          For fear of a surge in homeless animals due to coronavirus, shelters are thinking outside the box to place pets in new homes. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.  Sign up here. TAVARES, Fla. – Ellie the cat and her feline friend Willa recently arrived at the Lake County Animal Shelter in Tavares, Fla. It was a long road — but you would never know it judging by their personalities. ""Both are very affectionate girls,"" Whitney Boylston, director of the Lake County Animal Shelter, told Fox News. ""They both love attention and snuggle times.""       Ellie (left) and Willa recently arrived at Lake County Animal Shelter in Tavares, Fla. (Jessica Albert, Fox 35 Orlando)       CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Ellie was a stray, and Willa's owner just passed away last week. Both ended up in the care of Boylston's team, which on any given day has hundreds of animals in their shelter. The Humane Society of the United States told Fox News that pet homelessness is always a concern, claiming that nationwide 6.5 million pets will go through shelters annually. DOG, EXCITED BECAUSE OWNER IS 'HOME FOR QUARANTINE,' SPRAINS TAIL FROM TOO MUCH WAGGING But as coronavirus continues to spread and shut down large parts of the country, animal experts fear that the nation will see an uptick in surrendered animals. If left unaddressed, shelters across the United States could be at risk of severe overcrowding. “This is an issue all the time, but it becomes more acute during COVID-19,” said Kitty Block, the CEO and president of the Humane Society of the United States. “If people financially are running into difficulties caring for their animal, they’ll get surrendered to shelters. Or, if there are family members that become ill and can’t take care of their dog or cat or the pets they have in their home.” Block added that the potential problem is amplified because the CDC is urging Americans to stay home, which makes in-person adoptions difficult or, in some cases, impossible. So, many animal shelters are working to get ahead of the problem, and are trying new, more innovative tactics in order to find pet-loving homes for the animals in their care. Lake County, for example, is now offering an online service to view and select pets. Prospective owners can then Facetime with the animal to see if it is a good fit, and if it is, the shelter will deliver right to the new owner's door via the aptly named ""cuddle shuttle.""       A Lake County Animal Shelter worker loads Ellie and Willa into the ""cuddle shuttle"" to be delivered to their new owner (Jessica Albert, Fox 35 Orlando)       These new approaches have made an impact, with dozens of animals finding new homes this month, including Ellie and Willa. Both went to a Lake County woman named Tawnya McDonie, who initially only planned to take one cat. But, after she heard the shelter's call for help, she opted to take two. ""I'm a sucker!"" exclaimed McDonie. ""I would take every one if I could. But, in this time when people are dumping their animals, I decided to give two a home.""       Tawnya McDonie holding her new cat, Ellie, for the first time (Jessica Albert, Fox 35 Orlando).       For the time being, Lake County Animal Shelter is operating in a much better position. ""Our shelter census is actually lower today than it's been in a very long time,"" said Boylston. Out in Arizona, Maricopa County Animal Care and Control is using similar innovative services, while also flooding social media with calls for foster homes and adoptions. As a result, over 400 animals have been placed and many of their kennels are now empty. ""I have never seen a community come together like this for the animals,"" Mary Martin, the organization's director told Fox News. ""Hundreds of animals have gotten out of the shelter in the last week or so, to the point I have seen open buildings and open wings with just a few animals in them. It’s the first time we’ve ever seen this."" Martin cautioned, however, that her team still has plenty of work to do because they are restricted as to what animals they can take in. Due to coronavirus, she said they are unable to take cats or surrendered dogs, and can only accept stray dogs, which coincides with the Arizona state mandate. ""We're off to a wonderful start, but we're not out of the woods yet,"" said Martin. For the time being, she encourages residents who come across a stray animal to temporarily house it themselves if safe to do so. RELATED: Coronavirus outbreak may cause more adoptable pets to be euthanized, animal advocates say In the short term, the rate of animals entering foster care has skyrocketed as well. A report from the organization Petpoint, which aggregates data from 1,191 animal welfare organizations, shows a 93 percent increase in animals going to foster care compared to the week prior. Best Friends Animal Society, an animal advocacy group that also operates adoption centers around the country, has seen this trend firsthand. Their office in Atlanta typically puts 10 animals into foster care a week, but placed 62 from March 16 to March 20. They are asking that more follow suit. “There are so many dogs and cats who would love to spend this time with you and your family, and the need to support our local shelters has never been greater,” said Julie Castle, chief executive officer for Best Friends Animal Society, in a statement issued to Fox News. “For many people who are working remotely from home for the first time, the isolation may be difficult to adjust to. Having a pet for company can help make you happier, more comfortable and even more productive,” she noted. Like Martin and Block, Castle believes that there is still more to be done. Her prediction is that if COVID-19 continues to hamper the economy, the need to place animals will continue to grow. That's why her team will continue to find innovative ways to place pets and offset the demand as well. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP ""Unfortunately, we're already seeing the early signs of the economic ramifications around COVID-19, such as people losing their jobs or housing and having urgent surrender needs,"" said Castle. ""We are projecting that this is probably the bigger, longer-term threat.""

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.  Sign up here. The House of Representatives on Friday overwhelmingly approved a more than $2 trillion package to combat the coronavirus pandemic and send economic relief to workers and businesses squeezed by restrictions meant to stop the outbreak’s spread. The legislation, approved by voice vote despite 11th-hour drama arising from a GOP lawmaker’s objections, amounts to the costliest stimulus plan in U.S. history. It includes checks for most Americans, boosted unemployment aid, help for small business as well as a massive loan fund for corporations – at a time when unemployment is surging at a record pace, a consequence of businesses closing in compliance with social distancing guidelines. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW The bill, already approved by the Senate, now goes to President Trump's desk. “This bill is not only a rescue package, it is a commitment...that your government and the people whom you elected to serve will do everything we can to limit the harm and hardship you face, both now and in the foreseeable future,” House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said prior to the vote.  ""To the American public: If you do your part, I promise we will do ours."" The approval, while widely anticipated, followed a stretch of uncertainty over whether one congressman -- concerned about the stunning cost of the package -- might be able to stall the vote. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., had furiously objected to a simple voice vote that would have required only a minimal number of lawmakers to travel. Massie, as part of his push, wanted to ensure there is a quorum, which would require half of the members to show up on Capitol Hill. So as President Trump and others accused him of grandstanding, hundreds of lawmakers were summoned to Washington D.C. Thursday night and Friday morning from coronavirus-ravaged communities in New York, California and elsewhere. This, despite strict guidelines from the Capitol physician advising lawmakers not to congregate at the Capitol and to stay in their offices until needed to avoid the spread of the virus that has already infected several lawmakers. While Massie was able to ensure many lawmakers showed up for the vote, he was not, in the end, able to force a roll-call. The House, after several hours of debate, ultimately passed the measure by voice vote, and it was allowed to stand. There were loud cries for ‘ayes’ and few rumblings of ‘nos’ on the House floor. “The ayes have it,” declared the presiding officer, Rep. Anthony Brown, D-Md. But Massie stood up and objected. “I came here to make sure our republic doesn’t die by unanimous consent in an empty chamber and I request a recorded vote,” Massie said. Brown ruled that an insufficient number of lawmakers stood in support of a roll call vote. But Massie pressed on. “I object on the basis that a quorum is not present,” Massie said, instructing a count of lawmakers. “A quorum is present and the motion is adopted,” Brown ruled, to applause. Minutes before the vote, Speaker Nancy Pelosi took to the floor to summon social-distancing lawmakers at the Capitol in an effort to gather quorum and shut down the Massie effort. Pelosi touted the aid forthcoming for Americans and small businesses, while acknowledging that more needs to be done for state and local governments and the frontline healthcare workers. She paid homage to a nurse manager, Kious Kelly, who died from coronavirus after serving at a New York City hospital that had to resort to using plastic garbage bags as gowns. “We know that this cannot be our final bill,” Pelosi said. In a series of speeches prior to the historic rescue bill, lawmakers pressed for national unity despite the bill's imperfections. “We're going to help Americans through this,"" McCarthy said. ""We're going to do this together and in the end, we are going to be healthier, stronger and more united than ever before, because as Americans, that's who we are.” Upon catching wind of the plan to stop a roll-call vote, though, Massie howled on Twitter over the parliamentary machinations. ""It’s pretty clear now, with enough members here to pass the bill, that Pelosi and McCarthy are still working together to block a recorded vote just to insulate members of Congress from ACCOUNTABILITY. Biggest spending bill in the history of mankind, and no recorded vote? #SWAMP,"" he tweeted. After the voice vote, Massie accused Pelosi and McCarthy of trying to shield their members from the political ramifications. ""There's a big cover up in there,"" Massie said as he exited the Capitol. Emotions ran hot on the House floor all morning Friday before the vote on the $2 trillion stimulus bill. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., started her impassioned floor speech by noting 13 people died in one day at Queen’s Elmhurst Hospital and medical professionals still don’t have enough ventilators and personal protection equipment. She ripped the Senate for fighting for corporate bailouts that will contribute to the income inequality gap in order for families to get “crumbs.” “What did the Senate majority fight for? One of the largest corporate bailouts with as few strings as possible in American history. Shameful!” Ocasio-Cortez said. On the other side of the aisle, Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., said he’s “distressed by the Hobson’s choice"" lawmakers face of having to accept unrelated spending sprees in order to send relief. “No more billion-dollar bailouts for things that are unrelated. No more policies that are long-standing for a short-standing issue that needs our critical attention,” Perry said. In a bizarre and seemingly unnecessary point of drama, Rep. Haley Stevens, D-Mich., refused to stop speaking when her time ran out on the House floor, even though Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., was willing to let her finish if she had just paused to let him officially grant her more time. Instead, Stevens continued yelling and held up her hands – clad with pink surgical gloves—in an apparent homage to front line healthcare workers fighting the coronavirus pandemic even though her mic was cut. As the presiding officer was pounding the gavel and ruling Stevens “out of order,” Stevens screamed, “do not be afraid!” Republicans, who are trying hard to flip the freshman rep’s seat in November, immediately pounced on the outburst as a “meltdown.” The bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion-plus annual federal budget. The $2.2 trillion estimate is the White House's best guess of the spending it contains. The legislation would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year and $2,400 to a married couple making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child. Unemployment insurance would be made far more generous, with $600 per week tacked onto regular state jobless payments through the end of July. States and local governments would receive $150 billion in supplemental funding to help them provide basic and emergency services during the crisis. The legislation also establishes a $454 billion program for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries in hopes of leveraging up to $4.5 trillion in lending to distressed businesses, states, and municipalities. All would be up to the Treasury Department's discretion, though businesses controlled by Trump or immediate family members and by members of Congress would be ineligible. There was also $150 billion devoted to the health care system, including $100 billion for grants to hospitals and other health care providers buckling under the strain of COVID-19 caseloads. Frustrations were already hot as lawmakers had to return to Washington in a panic after Massie, R-Ky., threatened to upend plans for a simple voice vote with as few lawmakers as possible. “To you who oppose this bill: Please, please stand down,"" Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., pleaded on the House floor.  ""We can't wait another day to help. Don't add to this disruption by, in fact, being a disruptor. Be a leader."" Lawmakers spoke passionately about how COVID-19 is hurting the health of their communities and how the widespread shutdown of the economy is crippling families and businesses. Yet many openly grappled with voting in favor of bill they believe will be helpful, while it’s chock-full of other provisions that they disagree with. “This is ripping my heart out because there’s things in this bill that just don’t belong there. I consider them--,"" Rep. David Schweikert, R-Ariz., said, stopping himself midsentence. “Well, I can’t say that word in front of a microphone.” Schweikert, however, argued Congress must “do the right thing” by passing the legislation. However, Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., said he opposed the legislation over cost and debt concerns. ""As President Trump said, we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself,"" Buck said.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.  Former Vice President Joe Biden’s campaign on Friday adamantly denied a newly surfaced allegation of sexual assault leveled by a former Senate staffer, calling the claim concerning the purported incident decades ago “false.” “Women have a right to tell their story, and reporters have an obligation to rigorously vet those claims. We encourage them to do so, because these accusations are false,” Kate Bedingfield, deputy campaign manager and communications director for the Biden campaign, said in a statement to Fox News. SANDERS ACKNOWLEDGES 'STEEP ROAD' TO WIN THE NOMINATION A former executive assistant to then-Senator Biden also challenged the account, calling it ""clearly false."" The allegations were leveled earlier this week by a woman named Tara Reade, an apparent supporter of Biden’s primary rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who said she was a staff assistant for Biden in 1993 when he was in the Senate. Reade has come forward before—last year, when multiple women emerged claiming inappropriate touching by Biden. Reade, at the time, claimed Biden put his hands on her shoulders and rubbed his fingers up and down her neck, but was unable to gain traction on her story aside from an article in a local newspaper. But this week, Reade told a far more graphic account, with different and more serious details, raising the allegation to the level of sexual assault. Reade’s story first resurfaced in an article in The Intercept. She then was interviewed by podcast host Katie Halper. There, Reade claimed that in 1993, she was asked by a more senior member of Biden’s staff to bring the then-senator his gym bag near the Capitol building, which led to the encounter in question. “He greeted me, he remembered my name, and then we were alone. It was the strangest thing,” Reade told Halper. “There was no like, exchange really. He just had me up against the wall.” Reade said that she was wearing “a business skirt,” but “wasn’t wearing stockings—it was a hot day.” She continued: “His hands were on me and underneath my clothes, and he went down my skirt and then up inside it and he penetrated me with his fingers and he was kissing me at the same time and he was saying some things to me.” Reade claimed Biden first asked if she wanted “to go somewhere else.” “I pulled away, he got finished doing what he was doing,” Reade said. “He said: ‘Come on, man. I heard you liked me.’” BIDEN HOLDS 3-POINT EDGE OVER TRUMP IN WHITE HOUSE RACE: POLL  She said she felt that “everything shattered in that moment.” Reade went on to allege that Biden looked at her and said “you’re nothing to me.” Reade said she attempted to share her story last year, but no one listened to her. She added: “If people want to know why women don’t come forward, that’s a good example of why.” But Marianne Baker, former executive assistant to then-Senator Biden, rejected the allegations, in a statement provided by the Biden campaign. ""For nearly 20 years, I worked as Senator Biden’s executive assistant and supervised dozens of employees who reported to me. I took very seriously my duties with respect to human resources, following the direction of a Senator whose insistence on a professional workplace was embedded in our culture,” Baker, who worked for then-Senator Biden from 1982 to 2000, said in a statement. “In all my years working for Senator Biden, I never once witnessed, or heard of, or received, any reports of inappropriate conduct, period -- not from Ms. Reade, not from anyone,” she continued. “I have absolutely no knowledge or memory of Ms. Reade’s accounting of events, which would have left a searing impression on me as a woman professional, and as a manager.” She added: “These clearly false allegations are in complete contradiction to both the inner workings of our Senate office and to the man I know and worked so closely with for almost two decades."" Several women came out last spring to accuse the former vice president of inappropriately touching them, but Reade is the first to allege sexual assault. Biden and his campaign have denied accusations that he acted inappropriately around women. Still, the campaign, last year, vowed to listen to any allegations or concerns. For her part, Reade has openly advocated for Sanders' candidacy, at a time when Biden has amassed a daunting delegate lead over the Vermont senator in the Democratic presidential primary. The former vice president is widely expected to be able to clinch the nomination once primaries that have been postponed amid the coronavirus pandemic resume. “Please stay in Bernie,” Reade tweeted earlier this month. “I will sue anyone who continues to slander me call me a Russian agent The Charges of sexual harassment & worse against Biden are true I will have the information collected of your slander turned over to law enforcement #DemocraticPrimary #BernieForPresident,” another tweet, purportedly posted by Reade this month, said. The Russia reference likely pertains to past writings under her name that speak glowingly of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Reade has also given varying details about her time with Biden's office. A Medium post under her name from 2018 said she left D.C. amid concerns over American ""imperialism"" and ""xenophobia"" toward Russia. She later alleged that she left after Biden ""objectified"" her. Her account this week is more graphic than that given in a media interview in 2019. Fox News' attempts to reach Reade on Friday were unsuccessful.

The resolution, introduced by Sens. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., and Tom Cotton, R-Ark., calls on Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to retract what they called “highly misleading statements of support for the response of the Government of the People’s Republic of China.” CHINA ACCUSES US OF 'MALICIOUS FABRICATION' OVER EFFORTS AT UN TO STATE CORONAVIRUS ORIGINATED IN WUHAN ""For the first time, #China has reported no domestic #COVID19 cases yesterday. This is an amazing achievement, which gives us all reassurance that the #coronavirus can be beaten,"" Tedros tweeted. The lawmakers also flagged comments he made in January, praising the Chinese commitment and “transparency.” “We appreciate the seriousness with which China is taking this outbreak, especially the commitment from top leadership, and the transparency they have demonstrated, including sharing data and genetic sequence of the virus,” he said. “WHO is working closely with the government on measures to understand the virus and limit transmission. WHO will keep working side-by-side with China and all other countries to protect health and keep people safe.” Those remarks have also drawn criticism from other Republican senators such as Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who accused him of repeating a “lie that there was no evidence coronavirus could be spread from person to person.” “The actions of the Chinese Communist Party exacerbated the public health crisis plaguing the international community, and instead of prioritizing global health, Dr. Tedros and the WHO played favoritism to China,” he said in a statement to RealClearPolitics. TRUMP SAYS US WORKING CLOSELY WITH CHINA ON CORONAVIRUS AFTER CALL WITH XI The resolution from Sens. Blackburn and Cotton, which has a companion version in the House, takes aim primarily at the Chinese government, calling out the suppression of journalists and doctors who warned about the virus early on. “Chinese officials destroyed early COVID-19 test kits, suppressed information and refused international assistance,”  Blackburn said in a statement. “The Communist Party is so petrified of the truth that they kicked out journalists and fabricated a story of where the virus originated. It’s time the Communist Party admits to the serious missteps that heightened the severity and spread of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.” “The Chinese Communist Party wasted precious weeks on a cynical coverup instead of containing the China virus at its epicenter,” Sen. Cotton said. “Our first priority after protecting Americans must be holding China accountable for unleashing this plague on the world.” The resolution calls on China to state that there is no evidence that the virus originated anywhere but China, to end forced labor programs and the persecution of minorities, and to reject the conspiracy theory -- promoted by Chinese officials -- that the U.S. Army placed the virus in Wuhan.

The chamber initially intended to pass the bill by unanimous consent or a voice vote with just a skeleton crew in the actual chamber in order to reduce the risk of House members spreading the coronavirus between themselves. But it later became clear that at least one legislator, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., would object to an attempt to pass the bill in that fashion and try to force a recorded vote -- which would require a quorum of at least 216 members present and take hours due to social distancing procedures. He publicly confirmed that he would take that action Friday morning, citing a constitutional provision that requires a majority of members to be present for the House or Senate to officially conduct business. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW CUOMO EMPHASIZES NEED FOR VENTILATORS AFTER TRUMP DOWNPLAYS NUMBER NEEDED ""I swore an oath to uphold the constitution, and I take that oath seriously. In a few moments I will request a vote on the CARES Act which means members of Congress will vote on it by pushing 'yes' or 'no' or 'present,'"" he tweeted. ""The Constitution requires that a quorum of members be present to conduct business in the House..."" Massie also slammed the bill for what he said is wasteful spending and a lack of transparency. Massie's move triggered a mad scramble of legislators trying to get back to Washington D.C. to ensure the bill could pass Friday and the vote would not have to be put off until Saturday. After debate on the bill concluded, Massie made his stand to hold up the legislation. In the span of just over a minute, the vast majority of House members slapped down the Kentucky Republican's procedural challenge and approved the Senate's version of the coronavirus stimulus package to send it to President Trump's desk. Here's how it all went down. STATE DEPARTMENT TO WAIVE INTERVIEWS FOR FOREIGN FARMWORKER VISAS IN RESPONSE TO CORONAVIRUS Voice vote on adoption When House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., completed his final remarks on the stimulus package, Speaker Pro Tempore Rep. Anthony G. Brown, D-Md., immediately moved the chamber to a voice vote on the passage of the stimulus package. Brown couldn't finish saying ""The ayes have it"" before Massie interrupted him from the floor to request a recorded vote. Members refuse recorded vote ""I came here to make sure our republic doesn't die by unanimous consent and empty chamber and request a recorded vote,"" Massie said, forcing Brown to ask members who were in favor of a recorded vote to ""rise,"" meaning stand up. Normally, most members want a recorded vote on a bill. That was not the case Friday and nearly all the members remained in their seats. ""An insufficient number having risen, a recorded vote is refused,"" Brown said after taking a quick glance out into the House chamber, prompting Massie to use his next delay tactic. CONGRESS OKs $2T STIMULUS IN HISTORIC CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE, AS REP'S OBJECTIONS SIDELINED Massie argues there is not a quorum in House chamber ""I object on the basis that a quorum is not present and make a point of order that a quorum is not present,"" Massie said, trying to throw another roadblock in front of the $2.2 trillion spending bill. ""The chair will count for a quorum,"" Brown announced, glancing out over the chamber again. Bill passed Brown took just a couple seconds to ""count"" whether there was a quorum in the chamber. He did not need to actually count the members because House Democratic leadership had been keeping track of how many members were present and announced there was a quorum to the media just an hour before the voice vote. A Hoyer aide clarified exactly what happened. ""[W]e knew GOP Rep. Massie was going to call for a recorded vote, so Mr. Hoyer asked Members to make their way to the Floor and the House Gallery (to maintain social distancing) to establish a quorum and defeat Massie’s request,"" the aide said. ""[W]hen he suggested there was an absence of the quorum, he was overruled (because there was a quorum at that point in time)."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP With a quorum present, Massie had exhausted his parliamentary delay tactics and the bill was officially passed, just one minute and three seconds after floor debate ended. ""A quorum is present, the motion is adopted,"" Brown announced to a cheering House chamber. He then adjourned the chamber with an emphatic bang of the speaker's gavel.

"                          Phase three bill heads to Trump's desk to be signed; Chad Pergram reports from Capitol Hill. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. President Trump on Friday signed a more than $2 trillion legislative package to combat the coronavirus pandemic and send economic relief to workers and businesses squeezed by restrictions meant to stop the outbreak’s spread after the House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved the legislation earlier in the day. ""I want to thank Democrats and Republicans for coming together and putting America first,"" Trump said during an afternoon Oval Office signing ceremony. The legislation, approved by voice vote despite 11th-hour drama arising from a GOP lawmaker’s objections, amounts to the costliest stimulus plan in U.S. history. It includes checks for most Americans, boosted unemployment aid, help for small business as well as a massive loan fund for corporations – at a time when unemployment is surging at a record pace, a consequence of businesses closing in compliance with social distancing guidelines. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW “This bill is not only a rescue package, it is a commitment...that your government and the people whom you elected to serve will do everything we can to limit the harm and hardship you face, both now and in the foreseeable future,” House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said prior to the vote. ""To the American public: If you do your part, I promise we will do ours."" The approval, while widely anticipated, followed a stretch of uncertainty over whether one congressman -- concerned about the stunning cost of the package -- might be able to stall the vote. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., had furiously objected to a simple voice vote that would have required only a minimal number of lawmakers to travel. Massie, as part of his push, wanted to ensure there is a quorum, which would require half of the members to show up on Capitol Hill. So as President Trump and others accused him of grandstanding, hundreds of lawmakers were summoned to Washington D.C. Thursday night and Friday morning from coronavirus-ravaged communities in New York, California and elsewhere. This, despite strict guidelines from the Capitol physician advising lawmakers not to congregate at the Capitol and to stay in their offices until needed to avoid the spread of the virus that has already infected several lawmakers. “Massie has now become the most hated person on Capitol Hill,"" said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who left his home at 4:30 a.m. to drive to the Capitol to ensure the measure got passed. While Massie was able to ensure many lawmakers showed up for the vote, he was not, in the end, able to force a roll-call. The House, after several hours of debate, ultimately passed the measure by voice vote, and it was allowed to stand. There were loud cries for ‘ayes’ and few rumblings of ‘nos’ on the House floor. “The ayes have it,” declared the presiding officer, Rep. Anthony Brown, D-Md. But Massie stood up and objected. “I came here to make sure our republic doesn’t die by unanimous consent in an empty chamber and I request a recorded vote,” Massie said. Brown ruled that an insufficient number of lawmakers stood in support of a roll call vote. But Massie pressed on. “I object on the basis that a quorum is not present,” Massie said, instructing a count of lawmakers. “A quorum is present and the motion is adopted,” Brown ruled, to applause. Minutes before the vote, Speaker Nancy Pelosi took to the floor to summon social-distancing lawmakers at the Capitol in an effort to gather quorum and shut down the Massie effort. Pelosi touted the aid forthcoming for Americans and small businesses, while acknowledging that more needs to be done for state and local governments and the frontline healthcare workers. She paid homage to a nurse manager, Kious Kelly, who died from coronavirus after serving at a New York City hospital that had to resort to using plastic garbage bags as gowns. “We know that this cannot be our final bill,” Pelosi said. In a series of speeches prior to the historic rescue bill, lawmakers pressed for national unity despite the bill's imperfections. “We're going to help Americans through this,"" McCarthy said. ""We're going to do this together and in the end, we are going to be healthier, stronger and more united than ever before, because as Americans, that's who we are.” Upon catching wind of the plan to stop a roll-call vote, though, Massie howled on Twitter over the parliamentary machinations. ""It’s pretty clear now, with enough members here to pass the bill, that Pelosi and McCarthy are still working together to block a recorded vote just to insulate members of Congress from ACCOUNTABILITY. Biggest spending bill in the history of mankind, and no recorded vote? #SWAMP,"" he tweeted. After the voice vote, Massie accused Pelosi and McCarthy of trying to shield their members from the political ramifications. ""There's a big cover up in there,"" Massie said as he exited the Capitol. Emotions ran hot on the House floor all morning Friday before the vote on the $2 trillion stimulus bill. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., started her impassioned floor speech by noting 13 people died in one day at Queen’s Elmhurst Hospital and medical professionals still don’t have enough ventilators and personal protection equipment. She ripped the Senate for fighting for corporate bailouts that will contribute to the income inequality gap in order for families to get “crumbs.” “What did the Senate majority fight for? One of the largest corporate bailouts with as few strings as possible in American history. Shameful!” Ocasio-Cortez said. On the other side of the aisle, Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., said he’s “distressed by the Hobson’s choice"" lawmakers face of having to accept unrelated spending sprees in order to send relief. “No more billion-dollar bailouts for things that are unrelated. No more policies that are long-standing for a short-standing issue that needs our critical attention,” Perry said. In a bizarre and seemingly unnecessary point of drama, Rep. Haley Stevens, D-Mich., refused to stop speaking when her time ran out on the House floor, even though Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., was willing to let her finish if she had just paused to let him officially grant her more time. Instead, Stevens continued yelling and held up her hands – clad with pink surgical gloves—in an apparent homage to front line healthcare workers fighting the coronavirus pandemic even though her mic was cut. As the presiding officer was pounding the gavel and ruling Stevens “out of order,” Stevens screamed, “do not be afraid!” Republicans, who are trying hard to flip the freshman rep’s seat in November, immediately pounced on the outburst as a “meltdown.” The bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion-plus annual federal budget. The $2.2 trillion estimate is the White House's best guess of the spending it contains. The legislation would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year and $2,400 to a married couple making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child. Unemployment insurance would be made far more generous, with $600 per week tacked onto regular state jobless payments through the end of July. States and local governments would receive $150 billion in supplemental funding to help them provide basic and emergency services during the crisis. The legislation also establishes a $454 billion program for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries in hopes of leveraging up to $4.5 trillion in lending to distressed businesses, states, and municipalities. All would be up to the Treasury Department's discretion, though businesses controlled by Trump or immediate family members and by members of Congress would be ineligible. There was also $150 billion devoted to the health care system, including $100 billion for grants to hospitals and other health care providers buckling under the strain of COVID-19 caseloads. Frustrations were already hot as lawmakers had to return to Washington in a panic after Massie, R-Ky., threatened to upend plans for a simple voice vote with as few lawmakers as possible. “To you who oppose this bill: Please, please stand down,"" Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., pleaded on the House floor.  ""We can't wait another day to help. Don't add to this disruption by, in fact, being a disruptor. Be a leader."" Lawmakers spoke passionately about how COVID-19 is hurting the health of their communities and how the widespread shutdown of the economy is crippling families and businesses. Yet many openly grappled with voting in favor of bill they believe will be helpful, while it’s chock-full of other provisions that they disagree with. “This is ripping my heart out because there’s things in this bill that just don’t belong there. I consider them--,"" Rep. David Schweikert, R-Ariz., said, stopping himself midsentence. “Well, I can’t say that word in front of a microphone.” Schweikert, however, argued Congress must “do the right thing” by passing the legislation. However, Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., said he opposed the legislation over cost and debt concerns. ""As President Trump said, we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself,"" Buck said.

"                          Lawmakers race back to Washington after news that Republican Rep. Thomas Massie could prevent a voice vote on the relief package; Mike Emanuel reports. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. The usually outspoken champions of fiscal discipline were either muted in their concerns -- or muzzled by congressional leadership -- as the massive $2 trillion coronavirus response bill was approved by Congress on Friday. The House of Representatives on Friday passed the costliest relief package in U.S. history, aligning with the Senate and sending the measure to President Trump's desk. The package is poised to swell the deficit and add to a national debt that exceeds $23 trillion. CONGRESS PASSES MASSIVE CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE The bill, despite 11th-hour drama over process, was approved on a broad, bipartisan basis. Despite concerns over certain items, lawmakers generally made the case that the economic aid is desperately needed by workers and businesses squeezed by restrictions meant to slow the outbreak's spread. From a fiscal standpoint, there were warnings that the need to prevent an economic collapse, which would also dent the deficit, outweighed all else. A big component of the package involves federal loans as well as the Federal Reserve. It is possible that this money will be paid back, with interest. But other appropriations, including stimulus checks and extra unemployment aid and funding to states and more, do not necessarily have a funding mechanism attached to them. The usual conservative voices in Congress have been relatively mum—with the exception of Kentucky Republican Rep. Thomas Massie and Sen. Rand Paul, who before contracting the virus himself put forth an unsuccessful amendment to offset some additional spending. The purpose of the Paul amendment was “to rescind unobligated balances for certain international programs to offset the amounts appropriated in this bill to respond to the coronavirus outbreak.” The amendment, though, would not take funding appropriated for global health programs and foreign operations and related programs for Israel. A spokesman for Paul did not respond to Fox News’ request for comment. Massie, meanwhile, put up the biggest fight, to the dismay of his colleagues on both sides of the aisle. He said Thursday that the coronavirus bill equated to ""$60,000 per family of new national debt and dollar devaluation in this stimulus.” “Not a good deal,” he tweeted. Massie on Friday tried to force a recorded vote-- getting members on the record on the legislation--but was ultimately sidelined in that effort by Capitol Hill leaders. After the voice vote, Massie accused congressional leaders of trying to shield their members from the political ramifications. ""There's a big cover-up in there,"" Massie said as he exited the Capitol. “It’s pretty clear now, with enough members here to pass the bill, that Pelosi and McCarthy are still working together to block a recorded vote just to insulate members of Congress from ACCOUNTABILITY,” Massie tweeted. “Biggest spending bill in the history of mankind, and no recorded vote? #SWAMP,” he added. Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., also said he'd oppose the legislation over cost and debt concerns. ""As President Trump said, we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself,"" Buck said. But Senate Republicans, who helped to draft the legislation that was passed in the upper chamber unanimously on Wednesday, argued that there was no way to pump the brakes on spending and give the Trump administration what it needs to stabilize the economy. “This gave the administration flexibility,” a Senate GOP aide told Fox News. Some conservative groups, like The Heritage Foundation, argued that the stimulus package should be “targeted, temporary and directed at aiding public health efforts,” but that “at the same time, any fiscal response should not increase spending permanently.” The Heritage Foundation said that the stimulus package provides over $200 billion in special assistance to specific industries that they claim will “likely encourage political abuse.” The group also said that firms “should be able to secure loans only in amounts that are demonstrated to be directly related to their crisis-related losses,” while saying that turning the Treasury Department into an investment bank with “unlimited discretion is a recipe for cronyism, favoritism, poor results, and taxpayer losses.” Meanwhile, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Maya MacGuineas, defended the stimulus and said the ""massive debt"" facing the U.S. was due to past economic decisions. ""Because of reckless spending and unpaid for tax cuts during the economic expansion, we already faced $1 trillion deficits even before this crisis. However, to stave off a depression, lawmakers had to put near-term deficit concerns aside and act fast to stabilize the economy and control a pandemic,"" MacGuineas said in a statement to Fox News Friday. ""This $2 trillion package was necessary, but we’re definitely on a fast track to reach unprecedented levels of debt as share of the economy, and we’ll face hard choices to get our fiscal house in order,"" she continued. ""Once we get through this deadly pandemic and brutal recession, we will be faced with a challenging recovery complicated by our massive debt, made all the more painful by past years of excessive borrowing.” Other groups, like Tea Party Patriots and Americans for Prosperity, complained about spending for programs like NASA and ""Migration & Refugee Assistance"" that was included in the bill, but were not campaigning against the bill itself. Meanwhile, the Club For Growth said they supported a failed amendment put forth by Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., which would ensure the additional unemployment benefits do not result in an individual receiving compensation worth more than their original wages. “The federal government should not facilitate additional government dependency on anti-poverty benefit programs but instead should find ways to ensure the workforce returns to normalcy as fast as possible,” the Club for Growth said. The 880-page coronavirus stimulus package would amount to the largest economic relief bill in the history of the U.S. for individuals, large corporations, and small businesses -- and its unanimous passage in the Senate came despite grave concerns on both sides about whether it involved too much spending, or not enough. Democrats said the package specifically would help replace the salaries of furloughed workers for four months, rather than the three months first proposed. Furloughed workers would get whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment, plus a $600 per week add-on, with gig workers like Uber drivers covered for the first time. The package also would give one-time payments of $1,200 per adult and $500 per child directly to the public. Meanwhile, the massive economic relief package would provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines, given that Democrats wanted them to abide by new carbon emissions restrictions. The package comes after the latest unemployment numbers were released Thursday morning, revealing that Americans filing for unemployment benefits surged to 3.28 million last week as the coronavirus pandemic forced businesses around the country to close. The Labor Department said Thursday that the new number eclipsed the previous record of 695,000, which was set in 1982, and is well above the levels seen during the 2008 financial crisis. But the White House said Thursday that the latest numbers are no surprise, amid the Trump administration’s coronavirus strategy. As of Friday afternoon, the U.S. reported more than 97,000 positive cases of COVID-19, and nearly 1,500 deaths.

Joe Cunningham and Pennsylvania Rep. Mike Kelly became the fourth and fifth members of Congress to become infected. Cunningham, D-S.C., had been in self-quarantine after interacting with another member of Congress who tested positive for COVID-19 but was tested at the end of his 14-day isolation due to new symptoms. REP. SETH MOULTON IN SELF-QUARANTINE AFTER EXPERIENCING SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19 “I just want to give you all a quick update,” Cunningham said in a video posted to Twitter. ""Last Tuesday I began experiencing some mild loss of taste and smell, and it wasn’t until this week, when I was already self-quarantined that I learned that those can be mild symptoms for COVID-19.” Kelly’s office said he began experiencing flu-like symptoms earlier this week and consulted his doctor. His test came back positive Friday. ""When I started experiencing mild flu-like symptoms earlier this week, I consulted my primary care physician. My doctor ordered a test for COVID-19, which I obtained at the drive-through testing site at Butler Memorial Hospital. My test came back positive this afternoon,” he said. Kelly’s office said he was not in Washington for the House vote on the third coronavirus relief package, though he would’ve voted for the stimulus package had he been present. Cunningham said he was “set to come out of quarantine” late Friday night, “but because of these mild symptoms, I was tested yesterday for COVID-19 and today, I learned that I actually tested positive.” Cunningham said that “the medical advice I have received is that I should continue to stay self-quarantined for 14 days since experiencing my first symptom,” which he said was last Tuesday, March 17. THESE US SENATORS ARE IN SELF-QUARANTINE OVER COVID-19 “That would allow me to come out of quarantine on Tuesday, but to be extra cautious, I will stay in quarantine until Wednesday,” he explained, adding that his wife and his son are “asymptomatic but will be self-quarantined.” “I feel fine, I feel great, but even though I have to stay home for the next few days, this won’t stop me from working from home for my constituents here in the low country, and especially fighting for our low country businesses and the workers,” he said. Cunningham added that he is “extremely lucky that I do not have many symptoms,” and acknowledged that “there are others that are not as lucky.” Cunningham encouraged constituents to join him in praying for those who have been directly affected by the virus and those who have lost loved ones. “Anyone can get this,” he said. “We have to be vigilant and smart and listen to medical experts… We have to heed their advice and stay home... Don’t risk contracting this or spreading it.” Cunningham went on to say that while he was not in Washington, D.C., for the final vote on the massive multi-trillion dollar coronavirus stimulus package Friday, he supported the legislation and would have voted in favor had he been able to be present on Capitol Hill. Cunningham joins other members of Congress who have tested positive for the virus: Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., and Ben McAdams, D-Utah, tested positive for COVID-19. Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., is currently in self-quarantine after having symptoms of the virus. Meanwhile, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., tested positive for coronavirus over the weekend, sending several GOP senators into self-quarantine. Paul is the only known senator to have coronavirus at this time.

"                          Joe Biden addresses the future of presidential debates amid the coronavirus pandemic. Former Vice President Joe Biden bests President Donald Trump by nine points in a 2020 ballot test, in the first Fox News Poll since Biden became the de facto Democratic nominee. In a head-to-head presidential matchup, Biden is up by 49-40 percent over Trump, a lead that is outside the poll’s margin of sampling error. Another 11 percent would vote for someone else or are undecided.  Last month, Biden was ahead by 49-41 percent. The race remains a nine-point advantage for Biden over Trump when looking only at those voters extremely interested in the election (52-43 percent) and the former vice president has an eight-point edge in battleground states (48-40 percent). However, Biden’s advantage grows to 25 points, 57-32 percent, in close counties (where Hillary Clinton and Trump were within 10 points in 2016). CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS “Since our last poll, Biden has won enough delegates to make him the presumptive Democratic nominee, but the horserace has not budged. This might be a bad sign for Biden since he has received extensive and largely positive news coverage over the last month,” says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, whose firm conducts the poll with Republican Daron Shaw. “But there appears to be a modest rallying to the flag effect in response to the pandemic that is rewriting our political and social landscape in still unknown ways.” In the matchup, Biden is the choice among liberals, non-whites, moderates, suburban women, and voters ages 65 and over. Trump leads among conservatives, white evangelical Christians, those who attend religious services regularly, white men, and whites without a college degree. Meanwhile, by a three-to-one margin, voters like Biden’s commitment to choose a woman as his running mate.  Overall, 63 percent approve of his promise to pick a female, while 20 percent disapprove (17 percent unsure). There is no gender gap, but voters under age 45 are 10 points more likely than those ages 45 and over to approve (70 vs. 60 percent).  Among Democrats, approval climbs to 86 percent. Vetting of possible Democratic vice presidential candidates will reportedly start soon. The poll asks about the three female senators who also ran for the party’s nomination -- Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, and Elizabeth Warren. A Biden-Warren ticket bests Trump-Pence by 10 points and is the only ticket tested that puts the Democrats over the 50 percent threshold, 52-42 percent. The Trump-Pence ticket also trails both Biden-Klobuchar and Biden-Harris tickets by 8 points (both 50-42 percent).  The Democratic edge in all three matchups is outside the poll’s margin of sampling error. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “The conventional wisdom is that vice-presidential picks don’t have much of an effect on the national vote,” says Shaw. “That seems to hold true in these early ballot tests. What’s less obvious is whether there might be some influence within certain states or whether a specific candidate could deliver a strong convention or debate performance.” Pollpourri Both Democrats (80 percent) and Republicans (83 percent) believe the outcome of the November election will be “very” important to the direction of the country. Overall, 79 percent of voters feel the election will be “very” important. That’s up from 60 percent who felt that way just weeks before the 2014 midterm elections (October 2014), the only other time the question was asked on a Fox News poll.   In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, over half of voters, 53 percent, are “extremely” interested in the presidential election. That is about where interest stood in January and February (both 55 percent extremely interested). Conducted March 21-24, 2020 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,011 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters.

"                          FOX Business’ Grady Trimble on how automakers, like Ford and GM, are helping fight coronavirus. President Trump said Friday that he had directed Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to require General Motors to begin making ventilators under the Defense Production Act to combat the coronavirus pandemic after negotiations with the automaker had stalled. ""Our negotiations with GM regarding its ability to supply ventilators have been productive, but our fight against the virus is too great to allow the give-and-take of the contracting process to continue to run its normal course,"" Trump said in a statement, adding: ""GM was wasting time."" Experts say the U.S. is hundreds of thousands of breathing machines short of what it likely will need to treat a rapidly rising number of COVID-19 patients. New York, Michigan, Louisiana and the state of Washington have been singled out as virus hot spots in the U.S. In a statement, GM said it has been ""working around the clock for over a week"" with medical device company Ventec Life Systems and parts suppliers to build more ventilators. The company said its commitment to build Ventec’s ventilators “has never wavered.” ""The partnership between Ventec and GM combines global expertise in manufacturing quality and a joint commitment to safety to give medical professionals and patients access to life-saving technology as rapidly as possible,"" the statement went on. ""The entire GM team is proud to support this initiative."" Trump said that while the White House activated the act against GM, it may not be needed. “Maybe we won’t even need the full activation. We’ll find out,” Trump said Friday in the Oval office. The announcement came hours after Trump lashed out at GM and its CEO, Mary Barra, in a series of tweets. “As usual with ‘this’ General Motors, things just never seem to work out. They said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed Ventilators, ‘very quickly’. Now they are saying it will only be 6000, in late April, and they want top dollar,” he wrote. “General Motors MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio, or some other plant, and START MAKING VENTILATORS, NOW!!!!!! FORD, GET GOING ON VENTILATORS, FAST!!!!!!” he tweeted. GM sold the Lordstown plant to a company that wants to make electric commercial vehicles. Trump criticized Barra, saying: ""Always a mess with Mary B."" The tweets were an apparent response to a New York Times report that a $1 billion deal between the White House and the company was called off. The contract would have allowed the production of 80,000 ventilators. Trump's move appears aimed at price and volume negotiations with the government. But it’s Ventec, not GM, that is talking with the government, said Chris Brooks, Ventec’s chief strategy officer. Ventec ventilators, which are portable and can handle intensive care patients, cost about $18,000 each, Brooks said. That’s much cheaper than the more sophisticated ventilators used by hospitals that can cost up to $50,000, he said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has made multiple requests since Sunday for estimates of how many ventilators it can build at what price, and has not settled on any numbers, according to Brooks. That could slow Ventec’s efforts to ramp up production because it doesn’t know how many breathing machines it must build, he said. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Former Vice President Joe Biden praised Trump's announcement during a virtual roundtable with first responders. “The good news I just heard about ten minutes ago.. is that president has just finally implemented the act and he’s ordered GM to make ventilators,"" Biden said.

Now we were suggesting he do that over a month ago but the point is he’s done it and I congratulate him for it.” Fox Business' Matthew Kazin, Fox News' Paul Steinhauser and the Associated Press contributed to this report.     ",         Trump invokes Defense Production Act to force GM to make ventilators after stalled talks,         2020-03-27T162743-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/trump-general-motors-ventilators-defense-production-act,Fox
"                          President Trump signs $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. President Trump signed the more than $2 trillion coronavirus relief package on Friday and said it would help American workers across the country -- but the bill also includes millions for items unrelated to the pandemic. Fox News counted them up and found nearly $12 billion in spending that has a tenuous or disputed connection to the emergency. The final bill includes: Critics slammed those provisions of the bill. “It shouldn’t be stuffed full of Nancy Pelosi’s pork -- including $25 million for the Kennedy Center, grants for the National Endowment for the Humanities and Arts, and millions more for other measures that have no direct relation to the Coronavirus Pandemic,” tweeted Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., the lone congressman who tried to force a roll call vote that would have delayed the bill. TRUMP SIGNS $2T STIMULUS BILL AFTER HOUSE APPROVES HISTORIC CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE The questionably-relevant spending items come alongside stimulus that gives $1,200 payments ($2,400 for married couples) to individuals and hundreds of billions in loans and aid to businesses. Backers of the bill say some questionable items are not as ridiculous as they may sound. On Wednesday, Trump was asked about the $25 million allocated to the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts in D.C. “The Kennedy Center has suffered greatly because nobody can go there,” Trump responded. “It’s essentially closed, and they do need some funding. And I said, ‘look’ -- that was a Democrat request. That was not my request. But you got to give them something. It’s something that they wanted. You know, it works that way.” Trump added that the money for the center was negotiated down from $35 billion to $25 billion, while noting that the reduction was less impressive than he’d like. “That’s not a good soundbite. But that’s the way life works,” Trump said. Supporters of the president say the provisions are a necessary evil. ""President Trump's response to the coronavirus pandemic has been bold, exceptional and so far successful, but it is also clear that he is still forced to function within many of the swamp's long-standing, dysfunctional practices,” Michael Johns, a co-founder of the national Tea Party movement and a former White House speechwriter for President George H.W. Bush, told Fox News. “Most of the funds and resources allocated under the stimulus bill are absolutely essential,” he said. More than 99 percent of the bill’s funding goes to provisions directly tied to economic or emergency support. Advocates of the much-criticized spending carve-outs say there are reasons for them. Local PBS stations say the money is needed because it’s harder for them to find the donations they depend on. “How do you fundraise in the middle of a pandemic?” Mike Wall, of the public broadcasting outfit in Kodiak, Alaska, told The Washington Post. “I don’t want to be the guy going on the air in the middle of the virus saying, ‘Hey, by the way, now give us some dough.’” Other advocates for public broadcasting said they needed even more funding that the bill provides. “Seventy-five million is good but it’s really not enough,” Viktorya Vilk, program director for digital safety and free expression at PEN America, told The Post. Other lines in the emergency bill have their own supporters. Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar defended the $350 million for refugee resettlement, tweeting: “Immigrants and refugees, are Americans/pay taxes and as vulnerable communities need the resources ‘..to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus.’” As for the billions going to overseas aid in the developing world, the international development aid news outlet Devex reported that lobbyists were disappointed they didn’t get even more money. “Global health and development advocates had lobbied for more international funding to be included in the package but told Devex that while the relative lack of funding is disappointing so far, it is not surprising U.S. lawmakers are currently focused on domestic response and recovery,” according to Devex. Several widely-reported provisions in the bill that was first proposed by the House of Representatives also did not make it to the final bill, including emissions limits on airlines. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW The final bill does give $400 million to states for “Election Security Grants"" but does not say that the money must go to create mail-in ballot systems, which critics had said would raise additional election security problems. Many economists say the bill, even with irrelevant spending, is necessary. “It’s the political reality that unrelated things get attached all the time to “must-pass” legislation. Is this desirable? No. But the American people needed relief yesterday. This had to pass right away, even if it’s far from perfect,” Texas-based economist and political consultant Abby McCloskey told Fox News. Trump and nearly all Republican members of the House and Senate ultimately decided that emergency relief trumped concerns about needless spending. “I’m profoundly grateful that both parties came together to provide relief for American workers and families in this hour of need,” Trump said Thursday.

"                          Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer joins John Roberts on 'Fox News Sunday.' Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. President Trump took aim at Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Friday night, claiming in a Twitter message that the Democrat was “way in over her head” amid the coronavirus outbreak and “doesn’t have a clue.” As of late Friday, Michigan had more than 3,600 confirmed cases of the virus, ranking fifth in the nation, and had seen at least two deaths. “I love Michigan, one of the reasons we are doing such a GREAT job for them during this horrible Pandemic,” the president wrote. “Yet your Governor, Gretchen “Half” Whitmer is way in over her head, she doesn’t have a clue. Likes blaming everyone for her own ineptitude! #MAGA” TRUMP SAYS GOVERNORS HAVE TO GET KEY MEDICAL GEAR THEMSELVES, BUT 'WE'RE HERE TO HELP THEM' The Twitter message followed Whitmer’s accusations Friday that medical-supply vendors were being told “not to send stuff here to Michigan” – and her insinuation that the alleged orders were coming from the Trump administration. It also followed the 48-year-old first-term governor's previous complaint that Michigan wasn’t receiving “clear directives and guidance” from Washington for handling the outbreak. Earlier Friday, Trump told reporters during a White House news briefing that he advised Vice President Mike Pence – leader of the president’s Coronavirus Task Force – against communicating with Whitmer, claiming she was among a small group of governors who weren’t being “appreciative” of the Trump administration’s virus response efforts. “I say, Mike … don’t call the woman in Michigan. I say, if they don’t treat you right, don’t call,” Trump told reporters. The remark followed previous comments the president made Thursday during an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity. “We've had a big problem with the young, a woman governor,” Trump said. “You know who I'm talking about, from Michigan. We don't like to see the complaints.” That Thursday remark from Trump drew a Twitter response from Whitmer. ""Hi, my name is Gretchen Whitmer, and that governor is me,"" Whitmer wrote. ""I've asked repeatedly and respectfully for help. We need it. No more political attacks, just PPEs, ventilators, N95 masks, test kits. You said you stand with Michigan -- prove it."" Whitmer aired more concerns Friday during an interview with Detroit radio station WWJ-AM, according to Crain’s Detroit Business. ""When the federal government told us that we needed to go it ourselves, we started procuring every item we could get our hands on,"" Whitmer told WWJ. ""What I've gotten back is that vendors with whom we had contracts are now being told not to send stuff here to Michigan. It's really concerning.” Whitmer then doubled down on her claim during an appearance on CNN, Crain’s reported. ""We've entered into a number of contracts and as we are getting closer to the date when shipments are supposed to come in, they're getting canceled or they're getting delayed,"" Whitmer said. ""We've been told they're going first to the federal government.” Earlier in the week, Whitmer complained that Michigan wasn’t receiving “clear directives and guidance from the federal government” on how to handle the crisis.       The coronavirus outbreak has sparked tension between Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and President Trump.       “Frankly, a patchwork strategy of each state doing what they can, we’re going to do it if we need to, but it would be nice to have a national strategy,"" she said, according to MLive. Whitmer claimed that if the Trump administration had focused on the pandemic sooner, Michigan and the U.S. would ""be in a stronger position right now."" ""Lives will be lost because we weren't prepared,"" she said.

"                          Billionaire candidate ends campaign; reaction from former California Republican Party chairman Tom Del Beccaro. EXCLUSIVE: A Federal Elections Commission complaint has been filed against former New York City mayor and 2020 presidential hopeful Mike Bloomberg for an $18 million transfer from his defunct campaign to the Democratic National Committee. At the core of the complaint is the tenuous distinction between Bloomberg’s personal finances and those of his presidential campaign. The complaint is unique because of the nature of Bloomberg's self-funded campaign. He took no outside donations and maintained complete control over the campaign's finances, and the complaint argues this weakens the legal distinctions normally found between campaign cash and a candidate's personal wealth. “Allowing these kinds of contributions is everything we’ve said no to in 40 years of campaign finance jurisprudence.  Never has this been okay at the federal level.” Bloomberg’s ill-fated foray into the 2020 presidential race saw him spend more than $900 million of his own money, according to FEC filings. After he suspended his campaign and endorsed Joe Biden, Bloomberg announced he’d be transferring $18 million to the DNC and the campaign’s field offices to state Democratic parties. The complaint alleges that both far exceed FEC limits on campaign contributions. RELATED: BLOOMBERG GIVES MASSIVE $18 MILLION CONTRIBUTION TO DEMS “Allowing these kinds of contributions is everything we’ve said no to in 40 years of campaign finance jurisprudence,” said Dan Backer, the man who filed the complaint through his pro-Trump Great America PAC. “Never has this been okay at the federal level.” Backer, who has filed several FEC complaints and subsequent lawsuits against prominent Democratic politicians, said he expects the board members to agree with his assessment of Bloomberg’s contribution to the DNC. “If you allow Bloomberg to do this, you’re giving democracy to a billionaire oligarch,” Backer said. “… Having been unable to buy voters, he’s doing the next best thing and buying the party itself.” Despite a number of attempts to contact several members of Bloomberg’s campaign team, they declined to provide comment to Fox News. In response to a detailed list of questions, the DNC referred Fox News to two tweets by their communications director, Xochitl Hinojosa. In one tweet about Bloomberg’s transfer, she said his contribution is different because his candidacy was “in earnest” and that a candidate “moving money just to transfer to a party doesn’t pass the smell test.” Hinojosa also said the money would help the party to scale up its Battleground Build-Up 2020 initiative and hire more organizers. Both of which are explicitly mentioned in Bloomberg’s March 20 memo to DNC Chairman Tom Perez. “We hope this investment will dramatically expand the DNC’s Battleground Build-Up 2020 efforts across battleground states, drawing in part from our own incredibly experienced and talented organizing staff,” the memo read.

Perez is calling for a “recanvass” of the results of Monday's Iowa caucus. (AP Photo/John Bazemore)       By deciding to transfer the $18 million to the DNC, Bloomberg reneged on a plan to employ his campaign organizers through November by forming a Super PAC. Former field organizers have filed two class-action lawsuits in a federal New York City court against the campaign earlier this week, alleging that thousands were tricked into taking the jobs under false pretenses. RELATED: FORMER FIELD ORGANIZERS PROPOSE CLASS-ACTION LAWSUITS AGAINST BLOOMBERG CAMPAIGN Campaign contribution limits exist to dissuade actual and purported political corruption. Even if Bloomberg attached no conditions to his contribution, the appearance of an agreement is there. “Even if we want to pretend he’s not corrupting Tom Perez, it sure as hell looks like he is,” Backer said. The DNC likely would have control over how they spent the money, regardless of the insinuations in Bloomberg’s memo, said former FEC Commissioner Hans von Spakovsky. He added that the complaint is filed on “substantive legal ground.” “It does appear that he is using the campaign to launder a contribution to the DNC that is a massive violation of the contribution limits to those political parties,” von Spakovsky said. If Bloomberg’s proposed transaction is allowed by the FEC, it could open the door to millionaires across the country pulling similar stunts to advance their political ends. Bloomberg is exceptionally wealthy, but it doesn’t take a billion dollars to exceed the FEC’s $35,500 annual limit on contributions to national political parties. ""I think if the FEC does not go after Bloomberg, it will open up a huge loophole in the law."" “I think if the FEC does not go after Bloomberg, it will open up a huge loophole in the law,” von Spakovsky said. “All any rich individual would have to do is file one form with the FEC declaring their candidacy, open up a campaign account, file one report with the FEC, and then withdraw as a candidate.” Establishing a precedent that keeps this from happening is what Backer wants. He said an FEC fine wouldn’t hurt the former candidate’s bank account, but that it was important to close this potential loophole before it was exploited. Keeping politics as level a playing field as possible between moneyed interests and voters is a balancing act, one that could be made more difficult for the everyman if Bloomberg’s transfer goes through. “Bloomberg is entitled to spend as much of his own money on his candidacy as he wants, but that’s an expenditure and not a contribution,” Backer said. “Federal election law understands the difference, and whatever money he put into his campaign is still an expenditure -- not a contribution.”    ",         Bloomberg campaign hit with FEC complaint for $18M transfer to DNC,         2020-03-27T183126-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/bloomberg-campaign-hit-with-fec-complaint-for-18-million-transfer-to-dnc,Fox
"                          President Trump says General Motors needs to 'get on board' to produce ventilators at an affordable price. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. President Trump announced Friday he is appointing his trade adviser Peter Navarro to serve as his national Defense Production Act policy coordinator after using the act to force General Motors to begin making ventilators to treat coronavirus patients. “He’s a tremendous guy and he will do a fantastic job,” the president said during a press briefing with his coronavirus taskforce at the White House. He said Navarro will serve as the national Defense Production Act coordinator for the federal government. Also during the press conference, Trump pushed back against Democratic governors – like Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee -- who have criticized the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic. “I want them to be appreciative,"" Trump said. And he defended his decision to travel to Norfolk, Va., on Saturday to send off a Navy hospital ship headed to the New York City harbor to help hospitals in the country’s largest city deal with the crush of patients impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. A reporter pressed him on whether it was wise to travel as his administration encourages people to stay home to avoid spreading the virus. “I'm not going to be jumping around in a huddle,” Trump said, adding he’s going because he has “spirit for this country.” Earlier Friday, Trump said he had directed Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to require General Motors to begin making ventilators under the Defense Production Act to combat the coronavirus pandemic after negotiations with the automaker stalled. TRUMP INVOKES DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT: WHAT IS IT? Senate unanimously approves $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package; White House trade adviser Peter Navarro joins ‘America’s Newsroom.’ ""Our negotiations with GM regarding its ability to supply ventilators have been productive, but out fight against the virus is too great to allow the give-and-take of the contracting process to continue to run its normal course,"" Trump said in a statement, adding: ""GM was wasting time."" Experts say the U.S. is hundreds of thousands of breathing machines short of what it likely will need to treat a rapidly rising number of COVID-19 patients. New York, Michigan, Louisiana and the state of Washington have been singled out as virus hot spots in the U.S. After Trump invoked the act, GM said in a statement that it has been working around the clock for more than a week with Ventec and parts suppliers to build more ventilators. The company said its commitment to build Ventec’s ventilators “has never wavered.” Trump on Friday also signed a more than $2 trillion legislative package to combat the coronavirus pandemic. The legislation sends economic relief to workers and businesses squeezed by restrictions meant to stop the outbreak’s spread after the House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved the legislation earlier in the day. TRUMP SIGNS $2T STIMULUS BILL AFTER HOUSE APPROVES HISTORIC CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE The legislation, approved by voice vote despite 11th-hour drama arising from a GOP lawmaker’s objections, amounts to the costliest stimulus plan in U.S. history. It includes checks for most Americans, boosted unemployment aid, help for small business as well as a massive loan fund for corporations – at a time when unemployment is surging at a record pace, a consequence of businesses closing in compliance with social distancing guidelines. The bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion-plus annual federal budget. The $2.2 trillion estimate is the White House's best guess of the spending it contains. The legislation would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year and $2,400 to a married couple making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child. Unemployment insurance would be made far more generous, with $600 per week tacked onto regular state jobless payments through the end of July. States and local governments would receive $150 billion in supplemental funding to help them provide basic and emergency services during the crisis. The legislation also establishes a $454 billion program for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries in hopes of leveraging up to $4.5 trillion in lending to distressed businesses, states, and municipalities. All would be up to the Treasury Department's discretion, though businesses controlled by Trump or immediate family members and by members of Congress would be ineligible. There was also $150 billion devoted to the health care system, including $100 billion for grants to hospitals and other health care providers buckling under the strain of COVID-19 caseloads.

"                          2020 Democrat hopeful Joe Biden kicks off what he says will be daily livestreams on the coronavirus response. Two new national polls show the same thing: a majority of Americans approve of the job President Trump’s doing steering the federal government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. Trump stands at 51 percent approval and 46 percent disapproval in a Fox News national poll conducted March 21-24. And the president's approval rating for his management of the crisis stands at 51-45 percent in an ABC News/Washington Post national survey conducted March 22-25. THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLING ON THE CORONAVIRUS  But the Fox News poll indicates Americans are also divided on the Republican incumbent’s response to the coronavirus outbreak, with 45 percent saying he reacted appropriately and 46 percent suggesting Trump didn’t take it seriously.  The survey also shows that a majority of Americans – 53 percent – say the spreading of the virus across the country would have been less if the federal government had acted quicker. Just over a third of those questioned disagreed, saying nothing could have prevented the spread of the pandemic from coast to coast. And 58 percent polled in the ABC News/Washington Post survey said that the president was “initially too slow to take action to address the problem,” with 38 percent saying Trump “acted with the right amount of speed.” The polling comes as former Vice President Joe Biden and two outside groups supporting his White House bid are heavily criticizing Trump over his coronavirus response. Biden – the all-but-certain Democratic presidential nominee -- urged Trump a week ago to “stop saying false things. … People are worried. They are really frightened. And when these things don’t come true, you just exacerbate their concern. Stop saying false things [you] think make you sound like a hero.” The former vice president also arguing that Trump had repeatedly lied to Americans, saying, “For the first two months of this crisis, President Trump used his public statements to falsely tell us we had nothing to worry about. … Now he’s switched to falsely telling us that he’s taking action he has not taken, promising results he’s not delivered and announcing actions that he not even ordered. And people are scared.” BIDEN TEMPERS HIS CRITICISM OF TRUMP Biden tempered his remarks this week, but he continues to take aim at the president’s response to the crisis. And his campaign went up with a brutal video that used comments from the president the past two months downplaying the severity of the outbreak and arguing, “Trump knew. He failed.”  Priorities USA Action – the main super PAC that supported President Obama’s 2012 re-election and Hillary Clinton’s 2016 White House bid – is on the airwaves with a TV commercial that uses audio of the president’s comments and ends with a video clip of Trump saying, “I don’t take responsibility at all.” The ad’s running in key battleground states and the PAC announced on Friday that they’re coming out with a Spanish language version. Unite the Country, the pro-Biden super PAC, went up this week with a new TV commercial where the narrator says, “Crisis comes to every president. This one failed.” The group says the spot is part of a seven-figure ad buy that will run nationwide on broadcast and cable. Trump’s reelection campaign is pushing back, repeatedly accusing Biden of trying to politicize the coronavirus crisis. ""By preying upon Americans’ fear amid the coronavirus outbreak, Biden isn’t just playing cheap politics. He’s making the crisis worse. It’s dangerous,” the Trump campaign said. ""Biden's Monday morning quarterbacking is an effort to sow anger and division among Americans."" Campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh – responding to the super PAC ads -- spotlighted that ""it used to be that Americans faced national adversity with unity, but Joe Biden and his allies have abandoned that principle in favor of rank, despicable politics."" ""They offer nothing but partisan sniping from the sidelines and seek to undermine the federal response to the crisis by misinforming and frightening people,"" he charged.  The Trump campaign – alleging false allegations in both super PAC commercials – unsuccessfully tried to persuade TV stations to refuse to run the spots. The ads are still running – but could such criticism of Trump backfire on Biden? Veteran political scientist Wayne Lesperance noted that “Americans tend to rally around the flag during times of crisis. President Trump, who participates in daily briefings, is clearly the beneficiary of that support.” But Lesperance – vice president of academic affairs at New England College – pointed to the latest polls to emphasize that Trump isn’t enjoying the bump past leaders received during times of crisis. “The president's current support is faint praise when compared to the support other president's enjoyed in times of national crisis,” Lesperance stressed.  “In the aftermath of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, President George W. Bush enjoyed an 86 percnet approval rating. Eleven years later, following the attacks on 9/11, his son George W. Bush had approval ratings at 90 percent and above. In both cases, public support for those presidents soared. And while President Trump has better than usual marks for his handling of the COVID-19 crisis, his numbers still fall short of his predecessors."" He pointed out that ""normally, there is some risk associated with attacking a president during a time of crisis because the nation tends to rally around the president."" But Lesperance explained, ""Since this president's numbers, while more positive than negative, have not been as strong, there appears to be less risk with openly criticizing the president's handling of the crisis."" Biden congratulates...Trump? For the first time, the president on Friday afternoon used the powers granted by the Defense Production Act to compel General Motors to produce ventilators desperately needed by hospitals on the frontlines in the battle against the coronavirus pandemic. Biden has repeatedly criticized for Trump for not implementing the act since invoking it last week. The Defense Production Act gives the president the authority to mobilize private industry. But minutes after Trump used the act, Biden gave the president a compliment while on a live virtual roundtable discussion with first responders. “The good news I just heard about 10 minutes ago ... is that president has just finally implemented the act and he’s ordered GM to make ventilators. That’s really good news. Now we were suggesting he do that over a month ago, but the point is he’s done it and I congratulate him for it,” Biden emphasized. Tight race in crucial state A new poll in the key general election battleground state of Michigan shows a close contest between Biden and Trump. The former vice president stands at 44 percent support among those in Michigan likely to vote in November’s presidential election, with Trump at 41 percent, according to a Marketing Resource Group, LLC survey. Biden’s slight 3-point advantage over the president is within the poll’s plus or minus 4 percentage points margin of error.  The survey was conducted March 16-20. Michigan’s one of three so-called Rust Belt states – along with Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – that Trump narrowly flipped from blue to red in 2016, which was instrumental in his winning the White House. Sanders' ‘steep road’  Sen. Bernie Sanders admits ""it's going to be a very steep road"" to mount a comeback and defeat Biden for the Democratic presidential nomination. But the populist senator from Vermont, in an interview with NPR that was broadcast Friday morning, said he’s still assessing the future of his presidential campaign.

President Trump took aim at Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Friday night, claiming in a Twitter message that the Democrat was “way in over her head” amid the coronavirus outbreak and “doesn’t have a clue.” As of late Friday, Michigan had more than 2,200 confirmed cases of the virus, ranking fifth in the nation, and had seen at least 43 deaths. “I love Michigan, one of the reasons we are doing such a GREAT job for them during this horrible Pandemic,” the president wrote. “Yet your Governor, Gretchen “Half” Whitmer is way in over her head, she doesn’t have a clue. Likes blaming everyone for her own ineptitude! #MAGA” TRUMP SAYS GOVERNORS HAVE TO GET KEY MEDICAL GEAR THEMSELVES, BUT 'WE'RE HERE TO HELP THEM' The Twitter message followed Whitmer’s accusations Friday that medical-supply vendors were being told “not to send stuff here to Michigan” – and her insinuation that the alleged orders were coming from the Trump administration. It also followed the 48-year-old first-term governor's previous complaint that Michigan wasn’t receiving “clear directives and guidance” from Washington for handling the outbreak. Earlier Friday, Trump told reporters during a White House news briefing that he advised Vice President Mike Pence – leader of the president’s Coronavirus Task Force – against communicating with Whitmer, claiming she was among a small group of governors who weren’t being “appreciative” of the Trump administration’s virus response efforts. “I say, Mike … don’t call the woman in Michigan. I say, if they don’t treat you right, don’t call,” Trump told reporters. The remark followed previous comments the president made Thursday during an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity. “We've had a big problem with the young, a woman governor,” Trump said. “You know who I'm talking about, from Michigan. We don't like to see the complaints.” That Thursday remark from Trump drew a Twitter response from Whitmer. ""Hi, my name is Gretchen Whitmer, and that governor is me,"" Whitmer wrote. ""I've asked repeatedly and respectfully for help. We need it. No more political attacks, just PPEs, ventilators, N95 masks, test kits. You said you stand with Michigan -- prove it.""

""We've entered into a number of contracts and as we are getting closer to the date when shipments are supposed to come in, they're getting canceled or they're getting delayed,"" Whitmer said. ""We've been told they're going first to the federal government.” Earlier in the week, Whitmer complained that Michigan wasn’t receiving “clear directives and guidance from the federal government” on how to handle the crisis.

"                          FOX Business’ Grady Trimble on how automakers, like Ford and GM, are helping fight coronavirus. President Trump said Friday that he had directed Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to require General Motors to begin making ventilators under the Defense Production Act to combat the coronavirus pandemic after negotiations with the automaker had stalled. ""Our negotiations with GM regarding its ability to supply ventilators have been productive, but our fight against the virus is too great to allow the give-and-take of the contracting process to continue to run its normal course,"" Trump said in a statement, adding: ""GM was wasting time."" Experts say the U.S. is hundreds of thousands of breathing machines short of what it likely will need to treat a rapidly rising number of COVID-19 patients. New York, Michigan, Louisiana and the state of Washington have been singled out as virus hot spots in the U.S. In a statement, GM said it has been ""working around the clock for over a week"" with medical device company Ventec Life Systems and parts suppliers to build more ventilators. The company said its commitment to build Ventec’s ventilators “has never wavered.” ""The partnership between Ventec and GM combines global expertise in manufacturing quality and a joint commitment to safety to give medical professionals and patients access to life-saving technology as rapidly as possible,"" the statement went on. ""The entire GM team is proud to support this initiative."" Trump said that while the White House activated the act against GM, it may not be needed. “Maybe we won’t even need the full activation. We’ll find out,” Trump said Friday in the Oval office. The announcement came hours after Trump lashed out at GM and its CEO, Mary Barra, in a series of tweets. “As usual with ‘this’ General Motors, things just never seem to work out. They said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed Ventilators, ‘very quickly’. Now they are saying it will only be 6000, in late April, and they want top dollar,” he wrote. “General Motors MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio, or some other plant, and START MAKING VENTILATORS, NOW!!!!!! FORD, GET GOING ON VENTILATORS, FAST!!!!!!” he tweeted. GM sold the Lordstown plant to a company that wants to make electric commercial vehicles. Trump criticized Barra, saying: ""Always a mess with Mary B."" The tweets were an apparent response to a New York Times report that a $1 billion deal between the White House and the company was called off. The contract would have allowed the production of 80,000 ventilators. Trump's move appears aimed at price and volume negotiations with the government. But it’s Ventec, not GM, that is talking with the government, said Chris Brooks, Ventec’s chief strategy officer. Ventec ventilators, which are portable and can handle intensive care patients, cost about $18,000 each, Brooks said. That’s much cheaper than the more sophisticated ventilators used by hospitals that can cost up to $50,000, he said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has made multiple requests since Sunday for estimates of how many ventilators it can build at what price, and has not settled on any numbers, according to Brooks. That could slow Ventec’s efforts to ramp up production because it doesn’t know how many breathing machines it must build, he said.

Andrew Cuomo said Saturday that his state is considering bucking Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for personal protective equipment (PPE) in crisis situations that he said is worrying some health care professionals. The comments during a Saturday press conference came after the governor went out of his way Friday to emphasize his state's need for tens of thousands of ventilators after President Trump questioned the number that New York would need to deal with its coronavirus patients. Cuomo again spoke about New York's need for about 30,000 ventilators in a coronavirus worst-case-scenario Saturday, and he responded to reports that President Trump is thinking about an ""enforceable quarantine"" on the New York tri-state area. ""I don't even know what that means,"" Cuomo said, seemingly caught off guard by reporters' questions on the issue. ""I don't know how that could be legally enforceable and from a medical point of view I don't know what you would be accomplishing. But I can tell you I don't even like the sound of it, not even understanding what it is I don't like the sound of it."" CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE On the CDC PPE guidelines, Cuomo said his state would make its own decisions. ""There is a concern among health care professionals because the CDC guidelines suggest a different protocol for PPE and masks depending on the condition,"" Cuomo said. ""And apparently there is a crisis set of guidelines that the CDC puts out for ... how often you change your gown, how often you change your mask, etc. in a crisis. And the CDC has put those crisis guidelines in place and many health care professionals are concerned that those guidelines do not adequately protect the nurses and the doctors and the health care staff that are working on this issue."" CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW TRUMP MULLS CORONAVIRUS QUARANTINE ON NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY, CONNECTICUT Cuomo continued: ""[Commissioner of Health] Dr. [Howard] Zucker is looking at that. If we believe the CDC guidelines do not protect health care professionals, we will put our own guidelines in place."" Cuomo did not make clear exactly what guidelines he was referring to, but earlier this month the CDC released guidelines on how health care providers should use face masks, which are just one piece of PPE, during ""conventional,"" ""contingency"" and ""crisis"" capacities in hospitals. The CDC guidelines define their ""crisis capacity"" strategies as ""strategies that are not commensurate with U.S. standards of care. These measures, or a combination of these measures, may need to be considered during periods of known facemask shortages."" These crisis guidelines would involve re-use of facemasks, prioritization in who can wear them and, if there are no masks available, the use of patient isolation in rooms with air filters and homemade masks for doctors and nurses. Suggestions for potential homemade masks include bandanas and scarfs. Also in his remarks, Cuomo said New York would be moving its presidential primary from April 28 to June 23, updated reporters on his state's current health situation and re-upped his calls for people to take social distancing seriously. ""We're supposed to have a presidential primary election that's coming up on April 28. I don't think it's wise to be bringing a lot of people to one location to vote. A lot of people touching one doorknob, a lot of people touching one pen, whatever you call the new device on the ballots,"" Cuomo said. He continued: ""So we are going to delay that and link it to an election that was previously scheduled on June 23. The June 23 date is for state legislative races and congressional races. We'll move the presidential election to that date."" Cuomo also said New York would begin setting up hospitals that are exclusively for coronavirus patients. ""We're going to go to COVID-only hospitals... so that staff that is there is basically working on one type of issue,"" Cuomo said.

"                          Former Senator Tom Coburn, 72, has died after a years-long fight with prostate cancer, Fox News confirmed; Coburn retired from the Senate in 2015 amid health complications. Former U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma family doctor who earned a reputation as a conservative political maverick as he railed against federal earmarks and subsidies for the rich, has died. He was 72. Coburn, who also delivered more than 4,000 babies while an obstetrician in Muskogee, where he treated patients for free while in the Senate, died early Saturday morning, his cousin Bob Coburn told The Associated Press in a text message. Tom Coburn was diagnosed with prostate cancer years earlier. Known for bluntly speaking his mind, Coburn, a Republican, frequently criticized the growth of the federal deficit and what he said was excessive government spending endorsed by politicians from both political parties. FORMER SEN. TOM COBURN DIES AFTER YEARS-LONG CANCER BATTLE ""I've got a flat forehead from beating my head against the wall,"" he told voters during a town hall in July 2010. First elected to the U.S. House during the so-called Republican Revolution in 1994, Coburn fiercely criticized the use of federal money for special state projects and was among the few members of Congress who refused to seek such earmarks for their home states. He represented northeastern Oklahoma for three terms, keeping a pledge in 2000 not to seek re-election. He returned to his medical practice in Muskogee before asking voters in 2004 to send him back to Washington, this time to the Senate, so he could fight big spenders and ensure ""that our children and grandchildren have a future."" He left the Senate in early 2015, before his second term that expired. He announced the decision just months after being diagnosed with a recurrence of prostate cancer, but said his health wasn't the reason. He said he was convinced he could ""best serve my own children and grandchildren by shifting my focus elsewhere.” U.S. Sen. James Lankford, a Republican from Oklahoma, called Coburn “an inspiration to many.” “He was unwavering in his conservative values, but he had deep and meaningful friendships with people from all political and personal backgrounds,” Lankford said in a statement. FLASHBACK- TOM COBURN: HERE'S WHY PRICE TRANSPARENCY CAN REVOLUTIONIZE HEALTH CARE In 2009, Coburn shrugged off constituent complaints after the state's largest newspaper, The Oklahoman, ran a front-page photograph of Coburn hugging then-President Barack Obama. “I’m not aligned with him politically. I don’t know what people back home in Oklahoma would be worried about,” Coburn told the paper. ""But you need to separate the difference in political philosophy versus friendship. How better to influence somebody than love them?"" Coburn said he and Obama had become friends during orientation as freshman senators in 2004. As a senator, Coburn released a series of reports on what he described as wasteful government spending. A 37-page report in 2011, dubbed “Subsidies of the Rich and Famous,” detailed nearly $30 billion spent annually in government subsidies, tax breaks and federal grant programs to millionaires. “From tax write-offs for gambling losses, vacation homes, and luxury yachts to subsidies for their ranches and estates, the government is subsidizing the lifestyles of the rich and famous,"" Coburn wrote in the report. A joint report in August 2010 by Coburn and Arizona Sen. John McCain, who died in 2018, criticized stimulus spending, including $1.9 million for international ant research and $39.7 million to upgrade the Statehouse and political offices in Topeka, Kansas. Coburn’s stubbornness and thwarting of legislation considered worthy by Democrats frustrated then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. “You cannot negotiate with Coburn,” Reid, a Democrat, declared in 2008. “It’s just something you learn over the years is a waste of time.” During debate over the debt ceiling in the summer of 2011, Coburn was part of a bipartisan “Gang of Six” senators who supported an alternative plan to cut the deficit by almost $4 trillion over the next decade through budget cuts and increased revenue through changes to the tax code. COBURN'S WASTE BOOK DETAILS $19 BILLION IN EYE-OPENING GOVERNMENT EXPENSES Coburn also released a 614-page plan that outlined how the government could slash $9 trillion from the federal deficit over the next decade. Coburn’s suggestion led to the elimination of a federal tax subsidy for ethanol later that year. After leaving the Senate, Coburn continued to crusade against taxes, criticizing the Oklahoma Legislature when it passed a package of tax hikes in 2018 to shore up the state budget. A group led by Coburn attempted to launch a petition drive to overturn the tax hikes, but was ultimately unsuccessful. “Our state and our nation are better because of the lessons in fiscal responsibility we’ve learned from Dr. Coburn,” Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican, said in a statement Saturday. Born in Casper, Wyoming, on March 14, 1948, Coburn grew up in Muskogee, Oklahoma. After graduating from Oklahoma State University, he went to work at his family’s business in Virginia, Ophthalmic Division of Coburn Opticals, from 1970 to 1978. He later attended medical school at the University of Oklahoma. By the time he jumped into politics — a decision he said was based on runaway government spending and his distaste for career politicians — he was married to his wife, Carolyn, with three children and had established a successful medical practice. While in the Senate, Coburn delivered babies for free after he was threatened with censure for violating Senate conflict-of-interest rules that prohibited him from receiving compensation for professional services. Coburn had several health scares during his time in office. He was treated for malignant melanoma in 1975, and in 2011, he underwent surgery for prostate cancer. But health woes didn’t seem to damper his contentious attitude.

Steve Daines, R-Montana, and his staff have facilitated numerous emergency repatriation flights for U.S. citizens trapped abroad amid the growing coronavirus pandemic -- including a last-minute escape from Africa that highlights the risks for the thousands of Americans still stuck away from home, Fox News has learned. The pandemic has infected more than 400,000 people around the world and killed over 20,000. International lockdowns have led stranded travelers to reach out to lawmakers to cut through bureaucratic red tape, often with just minutes to spare. Pastor Mark Arbaugh, who had been stuck in Lima, Peru, told Fox News early Friday morning that he was one of those fortunate escapees in large part because of his hometown senator. ""Senator Daines' office was very helpful to us,"" Arbaugh said in a text message to Fox News while onboard his red-eye repatriation flight into Washington, D.C. He was traveling with several Montana Tech students. ""Wally [Hsueh], from his office, has been putting in some long hours. Wally worked hard at making sure that my group of 4 and our new friends that were stranded from Atlanta in the same hotel with us got on the same manifest,"" Arbaugh added.

But, Arbaugh said, he was looking forward to returning to the country when the situation stabilizes. Separately, U.S. Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates John Rakolta was recorded Friday debriefing five Montanan evacuees at Abu Dhabi Airport ahead of their repatriation flight to the U.S. -- saying it was ""no easy task to move from one airport to another without a visa,"" and that Daines, as well as foreign government officials and embassy workers, had ""moved mountains"" to get them back home amid ""very trying times."" ""I'm happy you're all able to get home; I know it's been at trying and stressful time,"" the ambassador said. ""I got my first phone call about three days ago from the senator from Montana [Daines], who called and said there were five young men stuck in the airport, didn't have food or water, and had their passports confiscated. And everyone was really worried. So the embassy was able to marshal some resources very quickly."" WATCH BELOW: UAE AMBASSADOR DEBRIEFS EVACUEES ON RESPONSE BY EMBASSY, DAINES, FOREIGN OFFICIALS Meanwhile, Isaac Sturgeon, 31, told Fox News that his return to the U.S. on Saturday night from Morocco came as military vehicles were preparing to enforce a strict curfew and shut down international travel indefinitely because of the virus. ""I just wanted to be back on American soil,"" Sturgeon told Fox News, who was traveling for skydiving instruction. ""I registered with the embassy ... There was a lot of silence for a couple days; I don't think they were use to this kind of high volume of phone calls and people at the gates."" That's when Sturgeon said his father ""decided to try to get a hold of Steve Daines directly."" Afterward, Sturgeon said, things moved quickly. Daines' office contacted the State Department to charter a flight for Americans when commercial flights were canceled. Once that was approved, Daines made the request to reserve a seat for Isaac. WATCH BELOW: VIDEO FROM STURGEON'S FLIGHT HOME ""I'm sure all the pressure helped a lot,"" Sturgeon said, referring to the senator's outreach. Ahead of the flight, the U.S. embassy ""emailed me and said get to the airport between 12:30 to 5:30, flights were leaving; go to front counter and show them your passport and they'll assign you a seat on one of those airplanes,"" Sturgeon said. WILL CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS BILL BE DELAYED? At the airport, Strugeon said tents had been set up by the U.S. embassy to help travelers who needed to sleep at the airport so they didn't miss a flight. Strugeon said once he landed, his temperature was taken and he had forms to fill out concerning his possible exposure to coronavirus. Strugeon received what he called ""wonderful"" help not only from Daines and his staff -- ""Liz [Dellwo] was great,"" and Daines himself was ""kind and humble,"" he said -- but also from British Airways, who flew him from Marrakesh to London.

The airline staff said they didn't know they were coming to get us until 5 a.m. that morning. Great spirit, complimentary snacks."" He added that he hasn't yet even had to pay for the flight. For those still stuck abroad, Strugeon had some advice: ""You've got to get on the horn, talk to people, be sociable to find out what the word is."" ""Especially in a foreign country you have to take matters into your own hands, be hyperproductive and find out what's going on,"" he continued. ""You have to care for your own life in a crisis; even in America you have to have common sense -- not everyone can help you. The government can't always be there for just you -- - you're not as special as you think. There's 350 million Americans our government has to take care of."" U.S. WAS BEST PREPARED COUNTRY IN WORLD TO HANDLE PANDEMIC, JOHNS HOPKINS FOUND       Montana GOP Sen. Steve Daines, at the Capitol.       At the same time, he said he benefited tremendously throughout the ordeal by linking up with another American from Colorado and joining a Facebook group full of other U.S. citizens in Africa. In an Instagram post, Strugeon sounded a celebratory note in mid-air: ""After an Evac flight out of North Africa 48 hours before boder closings, ...... im Home. Thanks to Senator Daines and staff member Liz, my Family, Facebook Groups, and amazingly warm hearted British Airline folks who didnt even know they were coming to get us until 5a.m. that morning! Hundreds of Americans have Been able to come home. Last but not least, Thank you President TRUMP for keeping your collected self steadfast among pathetic criticism and puppet media! I LOVE AMERICA....STAND FAST."" Other Montanans who have worked with Daines' office to secure release include Dale Brevik, who was stranded on an expedition cruise ship after it was denied disembarking in Argentina, as well as Matt Vincent and his family, who had been in Ecuador. Daines' office is additionally working to secure the release of other Americans abroad, including Necia Erickson in Cusco, Peru, and a slew of students in Huanchaco, Peru. “I’m so glad to hear that Pastor Mark and the Montana Tech students will be returning to Montana today and I wish them safe travels as they make it home,"" Daines told Fox News. He added that he was happy to have ""helped Isaac return to the U.S. from being stuck abroad during this time."" ""I wish Isaac and his family well, and look forward to hearing about their reunion. Welcome home, Isaac!” Daines said. ""I continue to work around the clock to bring other Montanans home stuck abroad.” Peru has posed numerous high-profile challenges for Americans abroad. In one extreme case, a 33-year-old American woman running out of her life-saving medication to treat her auto-immune disease finally boarded a flight home Wednesday after being stuck in Peru for about 10 days, but hundreds of other U.S. citizens remained stranded after the South American nation closed its borders due to the coronavirus pandemic.

"                          President Trump says he is considering imposing an enforceable quarantine on New York, parts of New Jersey and parts of Connecticut as part of the efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. President Trump on Saturday night said the administration would not be issuing a quarantine on New York, parts of New Jersey and some of Connecticut as part of the efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus. ""A quarantine will not be necessary,"" he tweeted, noting that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) would issue a ""travel advisory"" later in the evening. The CDC shortly after issued a Domestic Travel Advisory urging against ""non-essential domestic travel"" in the tri-state area for 14 days. ""Due to extensive community transmission of COVID -19 in the area, CDC urges residents of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut to refrain from non-essential domestic travel for 14 days effective immediately,"" it said, noting that the advisory doesn't apply to  ""employees of critical infrastructure industries, including but not limited to trucking, public health professionals, financial services, and food supply."" Such employees ""have a special responsibility to maintain normal work schedules,"" the CDC said, adding: ""The Governors of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut will have full discretion to implement this Domestic Travel Advisory."" ""On the recommendation of the White House CoronaVirus Task Force, and upon consultation with the Governor’s of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, I have asked the @CDCgov to issue a strong Travel Advisory, to be administered by the Governors, in consultation with the Federal Government. A quarantine will not be necessary. Full details will be released by CDC tonight. Thank you!"" Trump wrote. Trump had said earlier Saturday that he was considering imposing an ""enforceable quarantine."" “Some people would like to see New York quarantined because it’s a hotspot -- New York, New Jersey, maybe one or two other places, certain parts of Connecticut quarantined,” he said outside the White House. CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE “I’m thinking about that right now. We might not have to do it but there’s a possibility that sometime today we’ll do a quarantine -- short term, two weeks for New York, probably New Jersey and certain parts of Connecticut.” He said that if such a move happened, it would be primarily a restriction on residents of those states traveling to other parts of the country. He later said that, if enacted, it would not affect truckers or trade. He said that he had spoken to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, and said there was a problem with people from New York traveling down to Florida: ""We don't want that."" ""This will be an enforceable quarantine, but hopefully we won’t need it,"" he said. WUHAN, THE CHINESE CITY WHERE CORONAVIRUS BEGAN, STARTS EASING RESTRICTIONS AFTER TWO MONTHS OF QUARANTINE The move would be a dramatic escalation of the efforts to stop the spread of the coronavirus, and comes on the back of those states essentially shuttering daily life -- closing schools, businesses, leisure activities and urging residents to stay at home. Cuomo, who was holding a press conference at the same time as when Trump made his remarks to the press, expressed confusion at Trump's proposal -- saying he had spoken to him about a hospital ship and opening up emergency medical sites, but not a statewide quarantine. ""I spoke to the president about the ship coming up and the four sites, I didn't speak to him about any quarantine,"" Cuomo said. ""I haven't had those conversations, I don't even know what that means."" ""I don't even know what that means. I don't know how that could be legally enforceable and from a medical point of view I don't know what you would be accomplishing,"" he said. ""But I can tell you I don't even like the sound of it, not even understanding what it is I don't like the sound of it."" Trump told reporters that if he did go forward with the quarantine, it would be for a short time only, maybe as little as 14 days.

"                          Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden adds more campaign blunders; reaction from Fox News contributors Tammy Bruce and Jason Chaffetz. Just days after his commanding primary victories in Florida, Arizona and Illinois, the coronavirus has turned former Vice President Joe Biden into a virtual prisoner of his Delaware home, where he’s reduced to sniping at President Trump from the family rec room. “He’s making himself irrelevant,” Saikat Chakrabarti, a former chief of staff to Queens Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, told The Post, saying the virtual broadcasts were not helping. “We need action immediately, and Biden can’t do anything real right now.” “He’s making himself irrelevant. We need action immediately, and Biden can’t do anything real right now.” Biden has been forced to watch from the sidelines as President Trump steals the spotlight with daily coronavirus briefings that have been a ratings smash. BIDEN CAMPAIGN ADAMANTLY DENIES ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL ASSAULT Though some experts have criticized the president for spreading inaccurate information and promoting untested antibiotics during his briefings, polls suggest Americans are increasingly pleased with his performance handling the deadly pandemic. The latest findings from Gallup show the president with a 49% approval rating, approaching a career high he last enjoyed in February during the height of his Senate impeachment trial. The same survey found 60% of Americans now approve of his handling of the coronavirus crisis, including more than a quarter of Democrats. “I think Trump is being seen as handing the pandemic well by the public even though he was too late to start procuring any [personal protective equipment],” Chakrabarti said, explaining the polling bounce, adding that Biden missed his moment to make an impression. “[Trump] is the only one going up every day and talking to the American people.” “[Trump] is the only one going up every day and talking to the American people.” Sen. Bernie Sanders — whose challenge to Biden for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination  is sagging — has been in D.C. helping to hammer out trillions of dollars in coronavirus relief spending. The 78-year has also held several in depth coronavirus town halls via Facebook Live. But Biden has gone nearly dark. Aside from a call with reporters, and a virtual live-stream appearance at a fundraiser on Sunday, the ex-vice president reappeared on television on March 24. And his appearances have not gone smoothly. On his first day back on the air, Biden sat for an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper. During the brief Q&A, Biden coughed repeatedly into his fist shortly after telling the anchor he had no symptoms of coronavirus and had not been tested. At one point Tapper even scolded the vice president for not directing coughs into his elbow. The coughing came along with the usual Biden word salads. On “The View” that same day, the former veep told guest co-host Sara Haines that “we have to take care of the cure. That will make the problem worse no matter what.” He also had an emotional moment during a virtual CNN town hall Friday talking about personal loss and almost gave out his telephone number on live television. Many Democrats and armchair pundits have unflatteringly compared Biden’s performance with Gov. Cuomo, who has won praise from both sides of the aisle for his smooth command of facts, regular virus updates and tough, no-nonsense approach to defiant New Yorkers. The fervor peaked as the hashtag #PresidentCuomo zipped across Twitter last week. “He is currently the only Democrat showing leadership in a moment of crisis, at least publicly,” Chakrabarti said. “Cuomo is doing the daily press conference, he’s leading in a way that President Trump was.” Reps for Biden’s campaign declined to comment for this story. Though the pandemic has prevented Biden from deploying his famous retail political skills, his campaign has tried to remain active, putting out a blizzard of press statements including his own “action plan to save the economy.” He’s made overtures to the base even while in isolation, including checking in to DJ D-Nice’s “Club Quarantine” party on Instagram last week and making a virtual appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” Thursday. The campaign is also confident Trump will ultimately botch the coronavirus response. “Donald Trump’s failure to take this virus seriously in the face of urgent and obvious warning signs will go down as one of most incompetent and ultimately harmful decisions by a president in recent history,” a Biden aide told The Post. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Biden continues to hold a small but enduring lead over Trump in national head-to-head polls, with recent surveys from Emerson, Monmouth and NBCNews/WSJ all showing him out front. A Fox News polls this week gave him a 9 point lead. Other Democrats said Trump’s 60 percent coronavirus rating should be taken with a grain of salt. “During the Iran Hostage crisis, Carter had a 67 approval. For a leader in a time of crisis this is a pretty crappy rating. The Bushes both had 90s at one time,” Democratic strategist James Carville told The Post. “I think Biden will win easily. I don’t think it will be particularly close.”    ",         Democrats fret as Joe Biden becomes ‘irrelevant’ in coronavirus crisis,         2020-03-29T023937-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/democrats-fret-as-joe-biden-becomes-irrelevant-in-coronavirus-crisis,Fox

Former Senator Tom Coburn, R-Okla., a fiscal conservative and a fierce opponent of wasteful spending in the federal government, has died after a years-long fight with prostate cancer, Fox News confirmed Saturday. Coburn, who retired from the Senate in 2015 amid complications with cancer, died late Friday. His death was first reported by The Oklahoman. He was 72. TOM COBURN: HERE'S WHY PRICE TRANSPARENCY CAN REVOLUTIONIZE HEALTH CARE ""Because of his strong faith, he rested in the hope found in John chapter 11 verse 25 where Jesus said, 'I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me, will live, even though they die.' Today he lives in heaven,"" his family said in a statement to the outlet. He served in the House from 1995 to 2001 and in the Senate from 2005 to 2015. Coburn brought his experience as a doctor to the Hill, and was known for his fiscal conservatism and his strong stance against government waste as trillion-dollar deficits became a regular occurrence in Washington D.C.. He picked up the nickname ""Dr. No"" and released a ""Waste Book"" every year that outlined some of the more egregious examples of government waste. ""We're running trillion-dollar deficits. The way you get rid of trillion-dollar deficits -- a billion at a time,"" Coburn told Fox News in 2012. COBURN'S WASTE BOOK DETAILS $19 BILLION IN EYE-OPENING GOVERNMENT EXPENSES Vice President Mike Pence hailed Coburn as ""a great conservative voice in the United States Congress and American physician whose legacy will live on."" Sen, James Lankford, R-Okla., who succeeded Coburn in the Senate in 2015  paid tribute to Coburn as a ""tremendous leader"" and a ""great friend."" ""He was unwavering in his conservative values, but he had deep and meaningful friendships with people from all political and personal backgrounds. He was truly respected by people on both sides of the aisle,"" he said in a statement.

His greatest joy was his wife Carolyn and his daughters Callie, Katie, and Sarah and their families. Cindy and I pray for the Coburn family as they walk through this incredibly hard journey. They have lost a husband, father, and grandfather; we have lost a friend and a leader.” Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Coburn ""was truly 'Mr. Smith goes to Washington.'"" ""Very glad his suffering is over and he is now with the Lord,"" Graham said. ""Tom was a great senator, a terrific husband and father, and a dear friend."" Coburn's former staffer Courtney Shadegg wrote a touching thread on Twitter about the late senator, including about how he once had a middle seat on an airplane -- but he didn't mind. ""He replied.... 'it’s okay. My ego needed a middle seat, last row. Everyone needs it now and then.' I don’t think I’ve thought about middle seats the same since,"" she shared. Shadegg said Coburn also once showed kindness to a fellow lawmaker who ""got himself into big trouble due to a very embarrassing situation of his own making. Dr. Coburn wasn’t close with him and didn’t approve of what happened but he also knew he’d be mobbed by reporters and be an outcast for weeks."" ""He had me call his office and offer to be his buddy, walking w/ him to lunch and the floor whenever he waned. He also convinced a few other members to do the same.

"                          Navy veteran Dave Bray and Marine veteran Scott Brown perform. Erik Bartell is a millennial who has already done a tour of duty in Afghanistan. On his very popular Instagram, which has more than 16,600 followers, his tagline describes exactly who he is: ""Husband | Father | Combat Veteran… ⚔️ Iron Sharpens Iron."" Now based in Nashville, Bartell, 29, is working with Bravo Sierra, which makes performance-engineered products for members of the military and civilians, and it's stepping up amid the coronavirus pandemic. He told Fox News: “We have been primarily sending our antibacterial wipes with the option of our soap to the National Guard Soldiers that are being deployed to support the coronavirus. While the wipes do not kill the virus because they do not have alcohol they are an added layer of defense at this point with supplies running low everywhere.” Guardsmen have been standing at the ready nationally for missions such as building hospitals, organizing medical corps or assisting law enforcement. CLICK FOR COMPLETE COVERAGE OF THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK This week the National Guard was activated in states that have been hardest hit by the virus, which has caused havoc across the country and shuttered much of daily life. On Thursday, more than 200 U.S. Army soldiers were deployed to New York to provide a “full range of health care services” to the state fighting the most coronavirus cases in the country. The number of confirmed coronavirus infections worldwide topped 600,000 on Saturday as new cases stacked up quickly throughout western society and officials dug in for a long fight against the pandemic. The latest landmark came only two days after the world passed half a million infections, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University, showing that much work remains to be done to slow the spread of the virus. It showed more than 615,000 cases and over 28,000 deaths. The U.S. now leads the world in reported infections -- with more than 104,000 cases. Bartell is ready to lead, having had a rough start. “I grew up in the city of Chicago. I never knew my father and an abundance of my childhood was spent either homeless or trying to avoid it. From an early age I was conditioned to put one thing before all else: survival,"" he said. His military service taught him how to be a man in times of trouble. He explained: “There’s two types of leaders in the Army, those that lead from the heart, and those that lead from the rank on their chest. Throughout my entire career, I did my best to be the former. And my Soldiers would follow me into the depths of hell because of it. I led the most lethal platoon on the entire 101st Airborne Division. The most lethal platoon in the most deployed, and most decorated unit in the entire Army. Our team fired on all cylinders. We moved, shot and communicated more succinctly than 90 percent of the Army and we did it because I demanded it.  I demanded it of myself. I demanded nothing less than greatness of myself, not for myself but for the soldiers I led, because they deserved it. And in turn, they held themselves to the same standard. Often times leaders today look to receive credit and give blame. I learned early in my career that as a leader you are required to give credit and receive blame. You look out for your men and protect them from ridicule. Because by doing right when no one is watching you are creating a reputation that will precede you.” He has taken his leadership back to civilian life. The motto of the company he now works for: “We believe the U.S. military established the original wellness lifestyle -- optimized physical and mental fitness, founded on a unifying ethos of respect, service and integrity. We develop critical innovation performance products in direct collaboration with those that deserve it most -- our active duty service members.” Active duty is where he learned to tame the ego and reach a higher level to lead from a sense of teamwork and cooperation. CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE “Throughout my career, I found that a lot of leaders did things for themselves and not for those that they were supposed to be leading,"" he said. ""This is probably the most important lesson you can ever learn in leadership. Some call it servant leadership, I just call it leadership. When you lead men, they come before you. I learned this the hard way in Afghanistan. My platoon sergeant was a high-speed E-6 that had been put in charge of the platoon because there [were] no E-7s that could do it. This was his fourth deployment and he had seen his fair share of shit. He used to tell me his boots had more deployment time that I did -- He wasn’t wrong. The first time I went to the chow hall I grabbed a tray and got in line to start grabbing food. My platoon sergeant grabbed me by the shoulder and politely asked me, ‘what the hell do you think you’re doing.’ I must’ve looked like a deer in headlights. ‘Getting food,’ I replied. ‘The Soldiers eat first, sir.’ That’s all he had to say. I felt ashamed and knew I would never learn that lesson again. From that point on, no matter how scarce food was, no matter if I didn’t get to eat at all, which happened on multiple occasions, my Soldiers never went without food because of me. And this leadership principle extended far beyond food, it meant I would never send my Soldiers to do something I myself would not do. I would never ask my Soldier to assume risk I would not assume. It meant if my Soldiers were cleaning the floors, packing sandbags, sitting on guard, I would be right by their side at least for part of it.” He’s now a civilian looking to help society and community, in big and small ways, from Tennessee. Said Bartell: “I left the Army because I was ready to continue my legacy. Since I left the Army I ran a veterans nonprofit. I became a personal trainer, trained celebrities across the country and ran the most exclusive training facility in the nation. I consulted with million- and billion-dollar organizations on team-building and leadership. I helped transform the lives of thousands of veterans who were lost. I connected with a major celebrity who identified with our mission and raised millions of dollars around it. But my most important accomplishment in my short life thus far has been that I had a son. I now weigh my actions from the perspective of my son. Will he be proud of his father. Am I creating or compromising memories. My values have never been stronger than they are today. I have never been more certain of my impact on the world and the legacy I will leave my son. Leadership can mean many things, but to me leadership means taking care of those around you -- not because you have to, but because it’s the right thing to do.”    ",         Tennessee vet gives back during coronavirus pandemic,         2020-03-28T133450-0400,https://foxnews.com/us/tennessee-vet-gives-back-coronavirus-pandemic,Fox

(Photo by Omar Vega/Invision/AP, File)       “I’ve been in the music industry for a long time, but this was a different kind of experience where it was is more global than just like even making records, like the impact that it’s had on people just through playing great music and allowing people to feel good feeling connected during this time where we are all so separated (and) isolated,” D-Nice said. He began his career in the 1980s with the influential Bronx hip-hop crew Boogie Down Productions and had a solo career; he is now known for spinning beats at the hottest parties. But like most performers, his work came to a halt amid the call for social distancing and worldwide shutdowns to try and halt the spread of the coronavirus. So that’s when he took to Instagram. When he first began playing on the social network, he had no professional equipment. He only used his iTunes, pressing play and pause while talking about the songs. Eventually, he grabbed his actual turntables, and what began with about a couple hundred people exploded into more than 100,000 listening to his 9-hour set one day, and 160,000 joining his 6-hour set the following day.

A private New Jersey golf club aims to pay it “fore”-ward, collecting bottled water and Gatorade Sunday morning to donate to emergency room workers at a busy nearby hospital amid the coronavirus pandemic. “The membership here likes to give back to the town, and they saw a need here,” said David Bachman, the club’s general manager. “I think they stepped up to the plate.” A group of members at the Spring Brook Country Club in Morris Township is accepting donations to give to the Morristown Medical Center from 8 a.m. to noon, Bachman told Fox News. Earlier this week, the club sent a truckload of sandwiches to the respiratory unit, where they were taken out of the back of the vehicle and brought into the hospital without any direct contact. And it plans to send more “hoagies” as time goes by, Bachman said. The country club was incorporated in 1921 on 180 acres, according to its website. Members have for years been supporting charities in the surrounding town, Bachman said. The current membership roster includes some doctors and nurses who work at the medical center.

Todd McMurtry, the primary challenger to Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., is looking to take advantage of the negative press the libertarian incumbent has attracted this week for his efforts to hold up the $2.2 trillion coronavirus aid package. Massie, citing pork barrel spending in the bill and a rush to pass the legislation without a recorded vote or a quorum of legislators present, attempted Friday to throw up procedural roadblocks which were steamrolled by the vast majority of House members who supported the bill. Masse defended his actions on ""Cavuto Live"" Saturday, saying, ""if we're going to pass the biggest spending bill in the history of mankind ... people should go on record for this."" But according to McMurtry, Massie's moves were not only misguided but put members of Congress in danger. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW THOMAS MASSIE DEFENDS CONTROVERSIAL HOUSE REQUEST: CONGRESS 'DODGING ACCOUNTABILITY ON LARGEST EXPENDITURE IN HISTORY ""I'm sure that every piece of legislation that's ever been signed into law has some objectionable portions. It's all part of negotiation and compromise ... about 90 percent of that bill is pretty solid,"" McMurtry told Fox News on Saturday. ""I think what he did is unconscionable, and I think it's disqualifying. I wouldn't be surprised if somebody in the House gets sick and I wouldn't be surprised if one of those people had a bad health outcome and that's on Thomas Massie."" McMurtry gained national notoriety as the attorney for Covington Catholic High School student Nick Sandmann, who was caught up in a media maelstrom early last year after several national media organizations ran misleading video of a confrontation between him, several of his classmates and a Native American man at the 2019 March for Life in Washington, D.C. But additional footage was later discovered showing that a group of Black Hebrew Israelites had provoked the confrontation by slinging racial slurs at the students as they were waiting for their bus. Further footage showed that the Native American man, Nathan Phillips, had approached the group of students, contrary to early reports by a number of media organizations. CNN, one of several media outlets sued for defamation by McMurtry on Sandmann's behalf, settled the $250 million action for an undisclosed amount. TRUMP MULLS CORONAVIRUS QUARANTINE ON NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY, CONNECTICUT ""I follow politics and I'm active in the community and I've seen his votes over the years and I realized that he's totally ineffective and he's purely ... a libertarian ideologue,"" McMurtry said of Massie who assumed office in 2013. ""I became distressed over a couple of things, some foreign policy votes involving Israel, China, Hong Kong, the Uighur Muslims. I did some research and saw that he was one of the congressmen least likely to support President Trump."" McMurtry continued: ""In a time of crisis, whether it's the coronavirus, or whether it's the whole fake impeachment, the whole soft coup attempt that people attempted against the president, we really need to be on the same team."" McMurtry, who boasted that he had been put on a list of the top 50 lawyers in Kentucky, said that he's running for Congress because he thought he could use his skills as a lawyer to represent Kentucky's 4th District better than Massie. ""Congressman Massie is one of the bottom three percent [in effectiveness] of everybody in the House. We're complete opposites,"" McMurtry said. ""I'm effective, he's not. And I bring to this job the ability to advocate my position, to negotiate, compromise and to mediate disputes. He has none of those skills. He's alienated every single person in Washington."" It's not clear what statistics McMurtry was referring to when he said Massie was in the bottom three percent of effective legislators in the House of Representatives. But a 2019 study by the University of Virginia and Vanderbilt University found Massie was the 229th most effective Republican legislator in the House out of 245 members. That same study gained notoriety when former presidential candidate Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., repeatedly cited its conclusion that she was the most effective Democrat in the Senate. FLORIDA SEES SHARP SPIKE IN CORONAVIRUS INFECTIONS AS FEARS GROW IT COULD BE ANOTHER HOTSPOT Massie Saturday defended his principled approach to his job in the House, saying he is the most committed defender of Republican priorities, like reducing government spending, in Congress. ""I don't think I should be thrown out of the party. I represent the planks of the Republican platform more faithfully than any other Republican, virtually any other Republican in Washington, D.C.,"" Massie said of a call for him to be exiled from the GOP by President Trump. Massie also emphasized that the main reason he was trying to get legislators to take a recorded vote was to hold them accountable. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""When I get home, they really appreciate the fact that I stood up for the Constitution and I didn't let these folks shirk their responsibilities,"" Massie told Neil Cavuto Saturday. ""When you've got John Kerry mad at you, calling you names, and Nancy Pelosi calling you names, maybe you're doing something right."" Massie's stand managed to convince at least one group, the Republican Jewish Coalition, to make the rare move of backing a candidate in a contested primary. ""In January, we announced that we would not support Congressman Thomas Massie after he voted against the Never Again Education Act that expanded the US [sic] Holocaust Museum's education program,"" the organization said in a Friday statement that also cited McMurtry's support for Israel. ""Today, after Rep. Massie recklessly decided to hold up the stimulus bill designed to help Americans who are struggling because of the coronavirus, the RJC PAC has decided to endorse and fundraise for his GOP primary opponent, Todd McMurtry.""

"                          High court mulls law that requires doctors performing abortions in Louisiana to have hospital admitting privileges; Fox News chief legal correspondent Shannon Bream, anchor of 'Fox News @ Night,' reports from Washington. Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron is calling on his state's top health official to stop abortions in the state due to the coronavirus crisis, just days after Planned Parenthood sued several Texas state officials for a similar policy. Cameron, who is widely considered to be a protege to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., called on the acting secretary of the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services (CHFS) to declare that abortion falls under the state's ban on elective medical procedures as it looks to conserve medical equipment and resources while pushing social distancing standards to stem the spread of the coronavirus. ""Kentucky’s current ban on elective medical procedures exists to further the mandated policy of social distancing and to help conserve medical resources for use in fighting COVID-19,"" Cameron said in a statement Friday. ""Acting Secretary [of CHFS Eric] Friedlander is on the front lines of fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, and I am confident that he understands, better than anyone, the necessity of ending abortion procedures during this health crisis. His certification will immediately trigger action by our office to stop elective procedures during the pandemic."" CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW PLANNED PARENTHOOD SUES TEXAS GOV. ABBOT OVER ORDER TO STOP ELECTIVE ABORTIONS DURING CORONAVIRUS CRISIS  The American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky (ACLU-KY) and Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky (PPINK), two pro-choice organizations, jointly condemned Cameron's effort to stop abortions in his state. ""Our doors remain open for care,"" PPINK CEO Chris Charbonneau said. ""Denying or delaying health care places an immediate burden on patients, their families, our communities, and the health system, and can have profound and lasting consequences."" ACLU-KY staff attorney Heather Gatarek noted that medical organizations had discouraged governments from banning abortion in response to the coronavirus. ""As trusted health organizations like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have made clear, politicians should not push ‘COVID-19 responses that cancel or delay abortion procedures,'"" she said. ""These national medical experts further explained that ‘abortion is an essential component of comprehensive health care. It is also a time-sensitive service for which a delay of several weeks, or in some cases days, may increase the risks or potentially make it completely inaccessible.'"" SUPREME COURT AT APPARENT ODDS OVER KEY ABORTION CASE ON CLINIC ACCESS RESTRICTIONS Cameron's plea with Friedlander comes after Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear recommended earlier this month that hospitals put elective procedures on hold during the coronavirus crisis. Friedlander then later mandated that doctors cease all ""non-emergent, non-urgent in-person medical, surgical, dental, and any other healthcare practice or procedure[s]."" Pro-choice activists, however, have said that any move to put a halt on abortions during the coronavirus pandemic would jeopardize women's rights and health. ""Abortion care is time-sensitive and essential health care that has a profound impact on a person’s health and life, which is why it is protected as a constitutional right. Texas is abusing the state’s emergency powers and we are filing suit today to stop it,"" Nancy Northrop, the president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is joining Planned Parenthood in its suit against Texas, said in a statement on that state's abortion ban. Alexis McGill Johnson, the acting president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America said Wednesday that ""anti-abortion activists nationwide are forcing a legal and political fight in the middle of a public health crisis."" She continued: ""Elected leaders are expending valuable time and resources exploiting a global pandemic to score political points instead of rallying to respond to this crisis. This will place lives in jeopardy."" Cameron, however, said in his Friday statement that abortion is not essential unless the life of the mother is at risk and accused abortion providers of standing alone among medical providers who are putting a temporary hold on procedures that don't have life-or-death consequences. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""Abortion providers should join the thousands of other medical professionals across the state in ceasing elective procedures, unless the life of the mother is at risk, to protect the health of their patients and slow the spread of the coronavirus,"" he said. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton Wednesday slammed the Planned Parenthood suit as counterproductive to the coronavirus fight, mentioning the common refrain from pro-choice activists that abortion is a ""choice."" ""It is unconscionable that abortion providers are fighting against the health of Texans and withholding desperately needed supplies and personal protective equipment in favor of a procedure that they refer to as a ‘choice,'"" he said.

"                          Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden adds more campaign blunders; reaction from Fox News contributors Tammy Bruce and Jason Chaffetz. Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden, who has previously said that women leveling misconduct accusations should be presumptively believed, sat for another television interview Sunday -- and again wasn't asked about the recent accusation by former Senate staffer Tara Reade that the former vice president sexually assaulted her in 1993. Speaking to NBC News' ""Meet the Press,"" Biden discussed everything from whether sanctions on Iran should be suspended during the coronavirus pandemic (""I would need more information to make that judgment,"" Biden responded) to whether Bernie Sanders should drop out of the race (""I think it's up to Bernie to make the judgment whether or not he should stay in the race or not stay in the race,"" Biden said.) Pressed by anchor Chuck Todd on Trump's record-high approval ratings, Biden downplayed the news: “In every single crisis we have had … president’s ratings have always gone up.” Biden went on to offer some advice to the president. ""He should be focusing on making sure we are in a situation where we are able to see to it that unemployment benefits can get to people,"" Biden said. But Todd, like CNN's Anderson Cooper during a virtual town hall on Friday, didn't pose any questions to Biden concerning Reade, despite the former vice president's previous stance on similar accusations. Both Cooper and Todd extensively covered the decades-old accusations against Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh. ""For a woman to come forward in the glaring lights of focus, nationally, you've got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she's talking about is real,"" Biden said during the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings. He added that was true ""whether or not she forgets facts, whether or not it’s been made worse or better over time."" Instead of asking about the alleged sexual assault, Todd queried Biden as to whether Trump had ""blood on his hands"" over the coronavirus pandemic. (""I think that's a little too harsh,"" Biden responded.) For his part, Todd moderated a Democratic presidential debate weeks after the Trump administration closed off travel from China, and asked no questions about coronavirus. “Women have a right to tell their story, and reporters have an obligation to rigorously vet those claims. We encourage them to do so, because these accusations are false,” Kate Bedingfield, deputy campaign manager and communications director for the Biden campaign, said in a statement to Fox News. Reade has come forward before — last year, when multiple women emerged claiming inappropriate touching by Biden. Reade, at the time, claimed Biden put his hands on her shoulders and rubbed his fingers up and down her neck, but was unable to gain traction on her story aside from an article in a local newspaper. DE BLASIO ADMONISHES CRITICS NOT TO 'LOOK BACK' ON HIS DECISION TO DOWNPLAY CORONAVIRUS BIDEN CAMPAIGN DENIES SEX ASSAULT ALLEGATION ; BIDEN TOPS TRUMP IN NEW FOX NEWS POLL But this week, Reade told a far more graphic account, with different and more serious details, raising the allegation to the level of sexual assault. Reade’s story first resurfaced in an article in The Intercept. She then was interviewed by podcast host Katie Halper. There, Reade claimed that in 1993, she was asked by a more senior member of Biden’s staff to bring the then-senator his gym bag near the Capitol building, which led to the encounter in question. “He greeted me, he remembered my name, and then we were alone. It was the strangest thing,” Reade told Halper. “There was no like, exchange really. He just had me up against the wall.” Reade said that she was wearing “a business skirt,” but “wasn’t wearing stockings — it was a hot day.” She continued: “His hands were on me and underneath my clothes, and he went down my skirt and then up inside it and he penetrated me with his fingers and he was kissing me at the same time and he was saying some things to me.” Reade claimed Biden first asked if she wanted “to go somewhere else.” “I pulled away, he got finished doing what he was doing,” Reade said. “He said: ‘Come on, man. I heard you liked me.’” HUNTER BIDEN SCANDALS EXPLAINED: UKRAINE, COCAINE, AND MORE She said she felt that “everything shattered in that moment.” Reade went on to allege that Biden looked at her and said “you’re nothing to me.” Reade said she attempted to share her story last year, but no one listened to her.

"                          Republican member of the Senate Armed Services Committee Sen. Tom Cotton joins ‘Sunday Morning Futures.’ Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., is calling out the Chinese government for continuing to lie about coronavirus, after their initial response to it – according to him – caused it to become the global problem that it is. Cotton pointed to facts on the ground in China that directly contradict the messages coming from the country’s leaders. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: CDC'S CORONAVIRUS 'TRAVEL ADVISORY' WILL ULTIMATELY 'HELP STOP THE VIRUS' “The Chinese Communist Party is still lying,” Cotton said, stating he knew in January that the virus could be a global pandemic because of the Chinese government’s response. They had downplayed its seriousness early on, despite placing tens of millions of people under lockdown, and now Cotton claims they continue to issue statements undermined by the facts. “You see it again today. So, for instance, China says they have no more new cases, no more new deaths, yet they just closed all movie theaters nationwide only a few days after having opened them up,” he told Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures,” adding that Wuhan mortuaries also tell a different story from government officials. “They say they’ve only had 2,500 cases that resulted in deaths or so, yet a single mortuary has ordered more than 5,000 urns. You can look at these basic facts to know that the Chinese Communist Party is still lying today, as they were in December and January, and that’s why what could have been a local problem in Wuhan turned into a global pandemic from which more than 2,000 Americans have now died.” MEDICAL PLANE REPORTEDLY USED FOR CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE IN PHILIPPINES 'CAUGHT FIRE AND EXPLODED,' AMERICAN AMONG 8 DEAD In February, Cotton had spoken of a Chinese “biosafety Level 4 super laboratory that researches human infectious diseases” in Wuhan. In light of that, plus China’s barring of the CDC and the expulsion of reporters from the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, and Washington Post, Cotton said that there is evidence that China is “trying to cover up the biggest story in the world.” Cotton said that China has recognized that the early story that the virus first came about in a Wuhan market is not true, although the population in the market served to spread it. “As for what happened in that biosafety Level 4 laboratory, that super lab in Wuhan, we still don’t know because the Chinse CP refuses to come clean,” he said. Cotton noted that China was researching coronaviruses. While he acknowledged that there are “legitimate reasons” for doing so, such as developing vaccines or therapeutic drugs, “we don’t know the origin of this virus still to this day.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Meanwhile, Cotton discussed how reliant the U.S. has been on China for the production of antibiotics and pharmaceutical ingredients, which is why he is pushing legislation to reduce this reliance by incentivizing manufacturing in the U.S. and having the federal government purchase American-made products.

Speaking at a contentious White House coronavirus news briefing on Sunday that involved testy standoffs with multiple reporters, President Trump declared that ""the peak in death rate"" in the coronavirus pandemic ""is likely to hit in two weeks,"" and said the federal government will be extending its social-distancing guidelines through April 30.PROGRAMMING ALERT: PRESIDENT TRUMP TO APPEAR ON ‘FOX & FRIENDS’ AT 8 AM ET""The modeling estimates that the peak in death rate is likely to hit in two weeks. I will say it again. The peak, the highest point of death rates, remember this, is likely to hit in two weeks... Therefore, we will be extending our guidelines to April 30, to slow the spread,"" the president said in the White House Rose Garden. Saying his earlier hope that the country could reopen by Easter was ""just an aspiration,"" Trump added: ""We can expect that by June 1, we will be well on our way to recovery"" and that ""a lot of great things will be happening."" When asked about worst-case scenarios if the country were to remain closed indefinitely, the president responded, ""You're gonna have large numbers of suicides -- tremendous [numbers of] suicides... You will see drugs being used like nobody has ever used them before, and people are going to be dying all over the place."" On a positive note, Trump went on to say that ""two of the country's largest health insurers -- Humana and Cigna -- have announced that they will waive copays, coinsurance, and deductibles for coronavirus treatments.""       President Donald Trump speaking during a coronavirus task-force briefing in the Rose Garden of the White House on Sunday. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)       In response to a question at the briefing, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, reiterated his estimate from earlier in the day that it remained possible that 100,000 to 200,000 people could die in the United States. ""What we’re trying to do is not let that happen,"" he said, calling the extension of social-distancing guidelines ""a wise and prudent decision."" Over 2,300 people with the virus already have died in the U.S. ""Models are good, but models often generate the kind of anxious question you asked,"" Fauci said, when a reporter asked how bad the situation could become. ""A model is as good as the assumptions you put into the model, and very often, many of these assumptions are based on a complexity of issues that aren't necessarily the same... from one country to another."" Fauci said the April 30 extension came after he, Dr. Deborah Birx and other members of the task force had made the recommendation. ""Why don't you people act a little more positively -- it's always get-you, get-you."" Trump said he'd seen early estimates that 2.2 million people could have died if the government had done nothing in a worst-case scenario, so ""if we can hold that down to 100,000"" or less, it would be a ""good job."" Had the country simply ridden the virus ""like a cowboy"" and driven ""that sucker right through,"" the president insisted, disaster would have unfolded. Separately, Trump openly questioned why the demand for surgical masks has skyrocketed in New York City and elsewhere, urging assembled reporters that they ""oughtta look into it"" because ""something's going on."" The head-turning moment came just hours after Trump touted the sky-high ratings for the events on social media, and shortly after New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio urged his constituents not to ""look back"" on his prior statements downplaying the coronavirus. ""How do you go from 10 to 20 to 30,000, to 300,000 [masks] -- even though this is different,"" Trump asked. ""Something is going on, and you ought to look into it as reporters. Where are the masks going? Are they going out the back door? How do you go from 10,000 to 300,000? And, we have that in a lot of different places. So, somebody should probably look into that. I just don’t see from a practical standpoint how that's possible to go from that to that, and we have that happening in numerous places."" Pressed on the matter later at the briefing, Trump called on New Yorkers to ""check"" Gov. Andrew Cuomo and de Blasio, both Democrats, about the changing mask numbers. ""People should check them, because there's something going on."" He asserted that it could be ""something worse than hoarding."" Cuomo said earlier this month that some people were stealing medical supplies. ""Not just people taking a couple or three, I mean just actual thefts of those products,"" Cuomo said. ""I've asked the state police to do an investigation, look at places that are selling masks, medical equipment, protective wear, feeding the anxiety."" Nevertheless, a CNN ""fact-check"" reporter, among others, accused Trump of making his claim without ""evidence."" DE BLASIO: PAY NO ATTENTION TO MY PREVIOUS CORONAVIRUS REMARKS Furious nurses staged protests outside of Jacobi Hospital’s emergency room in the Bronx over the weekend, claiming there was a dangerous shortage of masks and gloves there. Sean Petty, a pediatric nurse at the hospital, told the New York Post: 'We need billions of N95 masks. This policy that was put out by the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] is killing nurses. We already lost our first nurse in New York City. We’re gonna lose more.” Trump remarked that ""many of the states are stocked up"" on various critical supplies including ventilators -- although, he added, ""some don't admit it."" Later, Trump suggested that ""there's a question as to hoarding of ventilators"" in which some hospitals may be keeping the devices in case of a major problem in the future. Also at the briefing, Trump unloaded after PBS News' Yamiche Alcindor -- a frequent Trump antagonist who previously has asked numerous questions during coronavirus briefings about whether an unnamed administration official really used the term ""Kung Flu"" --  began with another critical query about Trump's past comments to Fox News on New York's demands or ventilators. Specifically, Alcindor accused Trump of saying that governors were requesting equipment they ""don't actually need."" In fact, Trump said that in some cases, ""equipment's being asked for that I don't think they'll need"" by the end of the pandemic. Alcindor doubled down when Trump pushed back on her characterization of his comments. ""Why don't you people act a little more positively -- it's always trying to get-you, get-you, get you,"" Trump responded. ""And you know what? That's why nobody trusts the media anymore. That's why you used to work for the Times and now you work for somebody else. Let me tell you something: Be nice. Don't be threatening. Be nice."" That confrontation prompted another wave of sympathy for Alcindor among left-wing journalists. Alcindor herself complained on social media that she was unfairly victimized by the president. (""I’m not the first human being, woman, black person or journalist to be told that while doing a job,"" she wrote.) Minutes later, Trump tusseled with CNN reporter Jeremy Diamond, who alleged the president had definitively said on Friday that he'd cut off communications with governors who weren't appreciative of his coronavirus efforts. Trump shot back that Washington state's governor, Democrat Jay Inslee, was a ""nasty"" person, and reiterated that Vice President Mike Pence would remain in open communications even with hostile governors. ""Your statement is a lie,"" Trump said flatly. Trump slammed Diamond for omitting a portion of Trump's quote in which Trump said governors and local officials needed to appreciate the broader federal disaster relief effort, not just Trump's own initiatives. ""We lift up their ratings, because their ratings are very low,"" Trump said, explaining why CNN had sent Diamond to the briefing even though some network figures have expressed open disdain for the president. ""I’m well aware that Trump has made plenty of mistakes handling this crisis,"" wrote The National Review's Alexandra DeSanctis after the briefing.""I’d just like to know how the media baiting him and alternating between throwing themselves pity parties and patting each other on the back improves that situation. These Gallup numbers [showing declining media popularity] are not a fluke."" For the most part, however, the president largely sounded positive notes as to practical developments over the past 24 hours of the crisis. HOW LONG WILL CORONAVIRUS LAST IN THE US? In addition to the waived copays and deductibles, Trump touted ""some interesting"" therapeutics that ""will be announced over the next few weeks."" He said he has been working on getting a system that could sterilize health-care workers' masks up to 20 times more quickly approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Trump went on to praise the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA] for turning New York City's Javits Center into a makeshift emergency hospital. ""It's an incredible, complex, top-of-the-line hospital. Everyone's trying to figure out how they did it,"" Trump said, noting that he was also unsure. ""And, I was a good builder."" The president maintained distance from other speakers at the briefing, and referenced social-distancing guidelines as soon as he took to the podium. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""Appreciate everybody being here -- beautiful day in the Rose Garden,"" Trump remarked as the press conference began. ""Tremendous distance between chairs.""

Unfortunately, the enemy is death, so it's very unpleasant. But, the level of competence, the level of caring, the level of love -- I just think it's brilliant. ... I'm very proud to be your president.""

President Trump called the United States’ fight against the coronavirus its “big war” -- and in southern Georgia, a group of military veterans is doing its part to help communities in need during this national crisis. “They’re still coming out in numbers getting food regardless of what the governor puts out,” said Hai Clay, a retired Army captain and president of Community Warriors.        Community Warriors passed out food Saturday in Phenix City, Alabama.       The nonprofit organization has run a mobile food pantry in partnership with Feeding the Valley, a Georgia based food pantry. Clay founded Community Warriors two years ago to meet growing needs in southern Georgia and parts of nearby Alabama. Every third and fourth Saturday of the month, the group has passed out food in Columbus, Ga., and Phenix City, Ala., with Feeding the Valley. Community Warriors usually has met in parking lots of churches or community centers, where people in need would line up in their cars to receive food as volunteers packed boxes into their open trunks.  As the number of COVID-19 cases has risen across the country, Community Warriors has seen a surge in the number of people arriving at sites to receive food. Clay said he usually would see up to 700 people showing up to accept food, but last weekend in Phenix City far surpassed that.  Phenix City Mayor Eddie Lowe requested that Clay pass out food on a Sunday, the group said. Volunteers started at about 7:00 a.m. Though they planned to hand out food until 2:00 p.m., they ran out by 10:15 a.m. Clay estimated that over 2,000 cars arrived.  “The mayor was out there and he had to get on the phone to call the chief of police to get some officers out there to help control the traffic because the line was going back into Columbus, Georgia, from Phenix City, Alabama,” Clay said. “It broke my heart,” said Carla Clay, the veteran’s wife and a Community Warriors volunteer. “All we could give them was a jar of peanut butter and something else.”  With unemployment increasing as the virus has spread, the group predicted the need for food will continue to grow. A mayor from a neighboring Georgia town reached out to see if Community Warriors could hand out food there.  “If we can make a change and people see it, hopefully it will spread,” Clay, a 26-year veteran, said.        Community Warriors volunteers helping get food to people in need.       Community Warriors has been involved in numerous civic projects beyond distributing food. During a time when lending a helping hand has been risky, Community Warriors has intended to continue its service in Georgia. “We help the Boys and Girls Club and the YMCA,” Clay said. “We built a garden with South Columbus Elementary School — this is what we’re about.”  Community Warriors has helped the community during hurricane seasons passing out food and blankets to evacuees. The group also has cut grass for the elderly and just started a youth chapter.  “Everyone’s telling me I am more busy now than when I was in the military,” Clay said.

CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW “It actually started off with maybe nine of us,” Clay said. “We were all military and it expanded to civilians that we saw were passionate about what we do, and it just blossomed.” Community Warriors’ roster has grown to about 50 members, aided by roughly 2,000 volunteers. Many of the veterans involved with Community Warriors have had post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD], as did Clay.        Hai Clay, a retired Army captain.

They sit in the house and won’t go anywhere, won’t talk to anybody, but the reason they come out is because of the comradery that we have.” In a short time, Community Warriors has hit its stride championing the neediest communities, with much more coronavirus relief work in the weeks to come.

Dave Grohl dedicated his performance of “My Hero” to first responders, playing a red guitar from inside his home studio, as Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas performed next from a comfy-looking red couch in their home in Los Angeles, a huge cabinet of records nearby. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE “Let’s stay strong together,” Eilish said before diving into her smash hit “Bad Guy” with her brother on the guitar. Ciara and Russell Wilson played with their kids in a tricked-out playroom; Ryan Seacrest spoke from his spotless kitchen; and Camilla Cabello and Shawn Mendes performed from their Miami home as the star's surroundings proved just as interesting as the unplugged performances. Melissa McCarthy urged viewers to donate whatever possible, Billie Joe Armstong performed “Boulevard of Broken Dreams” and Lady Gaga delivered an inspiring message in a simple gray sweatshirt – a far cry from her typical elaborate getups. “My heart goes out to people who have lost loved ones, and also to people that are losing their jobs,” Gaga said. “I just wanted to check in, to make sure that you’re finding the time to be kind to yourself and doing whatever you can to maintain your mental health. Social distancing isn’t easy but try and chat with your friends remotely, meditate when you can and otherwise, find joy however you can.” HOW LONG WILL CORONAVIRUS LAST IN THE US? Lizzo dropped by to chat remotely with John, Sam Smith sang “How Do You Sleep?” from his home, Demi Lovato performed “Skyscraper,” H.E.R. performed from her New York City living room and Ellen DeGeneres joked that she’s worn the same sweatpants for three days in a row. “I’m so grateful for all of the doctors and nurses all around the world, all of the first responders, all of the people keeping our supermarkets stocked, you are our heroes right now,” DeGeneres said. Tim McGraw sat atop the diving board at his pool as his dog ran around in the background and members of his band helped perform remotely – each member at their own home. “We all look forward to the day when concerts, events and sports finally restart and things get back to normal. But while we wait, we can all support each other and keep the faith,” John said, setting up a “once-in-a-lifetime, intimate performance” by Mariah Carey from her home studio. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Carey performed “Always be My Baby” as members of her band chimed in remotely – from their own homes. John wrapped up the unprecedented event with a surprise performance. “I lied when I said I didn’t have a piano in the house, but this keyboard is my son’s piano… I don’t normally play a keyboard like this, but seeing it’s the only thing I’ve got, I thought it would be nice just to dedicate a little bit of this song to all the incredible heroes that we mentioned before who are doing the best they can to make the world a better place during this awful crisis,” John said before belting out a verse of “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me.” Sunday's special show was offered free on all of Fox's broadcast, cable and streaming properties, as well as on iHeart Radio's stations.

Erik Bartell had to grow up quickly. ""Ever since I was little, I was the one that had to worry about bills, appointments, school, if we were getting evicted again, or if I was eating cheese sandwiches that day. I understood the weight of the world well before I understood how the world worked,"" he told Fox News. ""Because of this, I grew a heavy chip on my shoulder at a young age. I channeled all my energy into being successful in everything I did, in changing my legacy from that of my families. No one in my family ever went to college. None of them even finished high school. I would change that. No one in my family ever became anything, ever stood for anything, I would rather die on my feet than stand on my knees."" On his very popular Instagram, which has more than 16,600 followers, his tagline describes exactly who he is: ""Husband | Father | Combat Veteran… ⚔️ Iron Sharpens Iron.” Now based in Nashville, Bartell, 29, has been working with Bravo Sierra, making performance-engineered products for members of the military and civilians, and it's stepping up amid the coronavirus pandemic. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW His childhood before joining the military helped make him the man he is today. ""Chicago is a proud city. We're proud to be tough, both in the kind of work we do and the kind of people we breed. It was the murder capital of the world for a good part of my life, and growing up I knew it. In most places you know if you get in a fight, you likely will walk away with a black eye and a lesson. Growing up I knew if I got into a fight, I could die. I held my first gun when I was nine. It was a murder weapon that got thrown in the bushes near my apartment complex,"" he told Fox News. ""I lost my first friend when I was younger than that. He was an older kid in the gang I hung out around that got a girl pregnant and hung himself by his belt in his basement. He was always good to me, and to this day, I don’t understand why that was the decision he made. He was maybe 15 years old at the time. Throughout my childhood, there were numerous incidents like this that have forced me to be confronted by the world early while also reinforcing the perspective in my heart that I needed to escape this lifestyle, to escape this place."" He continued, ""As I grew older and became more and more involved in sports, I slowly gained confidence. Football and basketball allowed me to escape the reality of poverty, the stress of life and the people around me. On the field and on the court, life made sense, you either scored or you didn't, and winning was attainable. Up until high school, I never planned on living a long life because I had no concept of what that looked like. Sports gave me the confidence to be better and a medium to prove that hard work equals success, and mentors that cared about getting me there. But, self-confidence isn't as much of a characteristic as it is a fading state of being. Something that isn’t attained but maintained."" Athleticism was his golden ticket. ""Poor kids don't play basketball because they want to be Mike, they play it to escape from reality for 11 points at a time. I worked harder than everyone on the team. I would rather die on the field than leave an ounce of sweat unshed. I wanted to prove to everyone that I was worth something. I had to. I had to prove it to myself,"" he said. ""I came into high school athletics as a poor kid with no dad who never played football or basketball outside of in the street, and left captain of the team, a college prospect, scholarship opportunities for multiple schools."" School wasn't for him, though, until he got involved with the track toward the Army. The Reserve Officers' Training Corps [ROTC] ""is where I found my tribe,"" he said about the small group of people in college who understood his values. ""They got me. They wanted to work harder than anyone I had ever met, to be physically and mentally tough. Finally, I had found iron that would sharpen my own."" When he found his calling, it was time to shine. ""I went to basic training that summer. I was a leader the whole way through, Soldier of the Cycle for my class, and received word halfway through that ROTC wanted to sign me to an officer contract. This would mean that after graduating basic training I would report back to ROTC and move on in the pipeline to becoming an Army officer. I signed the contract that night. Returning to college was a blur. I had just returned from basic training, preparing for war, shooting rifles and throwing hand grenades. This was 2010, when the [Afghanistan] surge was kicking into high gear and everyone was deploying. All of my drill sergeants had seen combat and told us the stories of it. And then. after when most of the soldiers I led in basic went off to war, I went back to class. I knew from that point on that I wanted to become an army officer and lead men in combat. I wanted to be the best. I wanted to be an Army ranger."" But then, his body gave out. It dashed his biggest dream. ""I graduated college in 2013 and shipped off to training at Fort Benning, Georgia two weeks after I threw my tassel in the air. I was in the top 75 ranked cadets in the nation out of thousands. I got my first pick branch and duty station. I chose infantry and Fort Campbell, home of the legendary 101st Airborne Division. On the last mission of the Infantry Basic Officer Leadership Course, a 17-week program that prepares you for Ranger School and the physical and mental demands of being an infantry officer, I blew my knee. It was a 15-mile ruck march into a hasty attack and halfway through the ruck, I felt it pop. We carried anywhere from 80 pounds to 120 pounds on these mission on average. We were malnourished, got little to no sleep for weeks on end and had to perform at high levels for hours on end."" ""He continued, My body had finally broken. I finished the mission out of pure stubbornness and went to the medic immediately after. I had torn my meniscus and would need physical therapy, possibly surgery. All of my friends were going to Ranger School and I couldn’t run without breaking down in tears from the pain."" CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE As the pandemic has shut down so much of the world these days, Bartell, now a civilian, is nowadays using the digital realm to give back. ""I have created an online community page on Instagram of over 1,000 people where I am sharing workouts, as well as tips and tricks I picked up while in the military on how to strength train without equipment. I use everything from trash bags to T-shirts to replace common fitness equipment that people use in gyms but don't have at home.""

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. President Trump’s Director of the National Economic Council, Larry Kudlow, said on Sunday that he’s optimistic the American economy can reopen “in the next few weeks,” but stopped short of any promises . Speaking during an interview on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures,” Kudlow would not confirm President Trump’s assertion that the U.S. economy – currently suffering major damage from the financial downturn due to the coronavirus pandemic – would be “raring to go by Easter.” Instead Kudlow said the economy, and American life, going back to normal depends on how quickly the country can “flatten” the curve. “Everybody's leaning towards keeping America's great economy as, first of all, as stable as we can in the next few weeks,” Kudlow said. “Maybe it's going to take longer. I don't know.” CORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN He added: “I think we will come back strong. But a lot of this depends on the virus and whether we can flatten it out and get it to hook down.” Trump on Friday signed a record $2.2 trillion emergency relief package into law – meant to help working Americans, small businesses and major corporations hurting from the financial nosedive of the last few weeks.  The $2.2 trillion legislation will speed government payments of $1,200 to most Americans and increase jobless benefits for millions of people thrown out of work. Businesses big and small will get loans, grants and tax breaks. It will send unprecedented billions to states and local governments, and the nation's all but overwhelmed health care system. The government last week reported 3.3 million new weekly unemployment claims, four times the previous record -- leading Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to say in a TV interview the economy “may well be in a recession.” CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE The rescue package, however, did help stocks rally a bit on Friday amid hopes that it will cushion businesses and households from the economic devastation being caused by the coronavirus. The S&P 500 closed 3.4 percent lower, but still climbed 10.3 percent for the week, its biggest gain since March 2009. That follows two weeks of relentless selling. The Dow Jones Industrial Average's 12.8 percent weekly gain was its biggest since 1938, thanks largely to Boeing, which climbed 70.5 percent this week. Even after the rally this week the market is still down 25 percent from the peak it reached a month ago. The outbreak has forced widespread shutdowns that has ground much of the U.S. economy to a halt. This week more than 3 million people filed for unemployment benefits, shattering previous records. It's the first of what is sure to be many grim signs of the toll the virus is taking on the economy. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer continued her criticism of the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and blaming the federal government for exacerbating the shortages of much-needed medical supplies at hospitals around the country. Whitmer, a rising star in the Democratic Party and a fierce critic of the president, said that states are being forced to bid with each for personal protective equipment (PPE) and, in some cases, contracts in place have been set aside, delayed or canceled and the goods are instead going to the federal government. “It’s a source of frustration not unique to Michigan, but it’s a unique situation that we have in our country right now and it’s ... creating a lot more problems for all of us,” Whitmer said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” She noted that besides Michigan, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota and New York have all experienced similar issues.  CORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN “We the states are trying to actively get every piece of PPE that we can. We're bidding against one another and, in some cases, the federal government is taking priority,” she said. Whitmer added: “We've got to keep working to get all of these other pieces of equipment and when we're bidding against one another, it's creating a lot of frustration and concern.” The Michigan governor has been one of the most vocal state officials to criticize Trump, drawing his ire both during his daily White House coronavirus task force press conferences and on Twitter.  Trump said last week that he was having an issue with ""the young, a woman governor, you know who I'm talking about, from Michigan."" CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Whitmer responded on Twitter by introducing herself to Trump and saying she’s “asked repeatedly and respectfully for help. We need it. No more political attacks, just PPEs, ventilators, N95 masks, test kits.” She added: “You said you stand with Michigan — prove it.” Trump fired back in a tweet over the weekend by saying Whitmer is  “way in over her head"" and adding that “she doesn’t have a clue.” Michigan is quickly become a hotbed for the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, with Wayne County – home  to Detroit – having the largest number of infections outside the New York and Chicago areas. Worldwide, Michigan has the fifth highest number of reported cases, with over 4,600 people having the contagion, according to the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University.

"                          COVID-19 relief package includes payments to Americans, aid to hospitals, and loans, grants for small businesses; House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy joins ‘Sunday Morning Futures.’ Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., touted on Sunday the benefits that small businesses will receive under the massive stimulus bill passed by Congress and signed by President Trump last week.  “For the small business owner, we want to make sure we're keeping people employed,” McCarthy said during an interview on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures.” “And if you are a small business, 500 employees to just a gig worker yourself, you get a guaranteed loan from the government for two and a half times your payroll if you use that money to pay your employees.” McCarthy added: “If you already laid them off, bring them back and pay them. Pay your rent, pay your utilities. And that is forgiven…. This is critical to get us through the next two months and get this economy coming back.” CORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN After intense negotiations between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Democratic leaders in the Senate, the upper chamber of Congress passed the $2.2 trillion coronavirus stimulus compromise package. The bill was quickly pushed through the House as lawmakers steamrolled an effort by a lone GOP representative to delay it and soon after signed by the president.  The package would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year, and $2,400 to married couples making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child. After a $75,000 threshold for individuals, the benefit would be reduced by $5 for each $100 the taxpayer makes. A similar $150,000 threshold applies to couples, and a $112,500 threshold for heads of households. The final package also offers $349 billion in loans to small businesses -- and money spent on rent, payroll and utilities becomes grants that don't need to be paid back. Many hotels would qualify as small businesses under the plan. The stimulus plan passed last week is the third one Congress has pushed through since the coronavirus pandemic began to take its toll on the American economy and lawmakers are not ruling out the possibility of another package if the pocketbooks of companies and everyday Americans continue to take a beating. McCarthy, however, says he wants to see how the $2.2 trillion package works out before making any moves for another stimulus plan. CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE “Before we go to start drafting the fourth package, I'd like these three packages we just put out,” he said. “Remember, it's more than $2 trillion, the largest we've ever seen to take care and get this economy moving.” The House Minority Leader added that he doesn’t want to see a fourth stimulus package put together just so House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and other Democrats can get the items they wanted included that were struck from the other bills. “What concerns me is when I listen to Nancy Pelosi talk about a fourth package now, it's because she did not get out of things that she really wanted to change the election law,” he said. “A Green New Deal. Expand it. Make us pay for Planned Parenthood and expand what you're seeing for sanctuary cities. Those are the things why this bill was held up for a week. But those are the things that we stopped.”    ",         McCarthy touts small business aid included in $2.2 trillion stimulus package,         2020-03-29T122559-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/mccarthy-touts-small-business-aid-included-in-2-2-trillion-stimulus-package,Fox

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called out President Trump on Sunday over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, saying that his denial of the seriousness of the pathogen and his delay in ramping up the federal government’s response to it has proved “deadly” for Americans. “His denial at the beginning was deadly, his delaying of getting equipment ... to where it is needed is deadly, and now the best thing would be to do is to prevent more loss of life, rather than open things up so that, because we just don't know,” Pelosi said during an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Pelosi also criticized Trump for suggesting that he would relax federal guidelines on business closures and social distancing in parts of the country so far less affected by the coronavirus – arguing that the U.S. “should be taking every precaution” and questioning whether Trump is listening to public health officials’ suggestions. CORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN “As the president fiddles, people are dying. We just have to take every precaution,” she added. Pelosi’s comments come after the president repeatedly said last week that he wants to open the country back up as soon as possible.  Speaking from the Rose Garden last week during a Fox News town hall, Trump said he ""would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter."" The holiday this year lands on April 12. Trump’s hope to open the country back up – and jump-start an economy crippled by the outbreak – has been met with skepticism from many Washington insiders and state and local officials across the country. “I have to respectively disagree that we’re looking to be done with this soon,” New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said during a news conference last week. “We are doing all we can just to get through March. April will unquestionably be worse than March. May could be worse than April."" New York is currently the epicenter of the virus, with more than 53,000 infections reported in the state – more than 30,000 of which are in New York City alone. Members of Trump’s own Republican Party have also expressed skepticism in Trump’s boost to have the economy up and running by Easter. Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, who serves as House Republican Conference chair, urged caution on Tuesday, although she didn't explicitly address Trump's comments. CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE ""There will be no normally functioning economy if our hospitals are overwhelmed and thousands of Americans of all ages, including our doctors and nurses, lay dying because we have failed to do what’s necessary to stop the virus,"" Cheney tweeted. Indeed, health experts have made clear that unless Americans continue to dramatically limit social interaction -- staying home from work and isolating themselves -- the number of infections will overwhelm the health care system, as it has in parts of Italy, leading to many more deaths. While the worst outbreaks are concentrated in certain parts of the country, such as New York, experts warn that the highly infectious disease is certain to spread. “That’s really very flexible,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a prominent member of the White House's coronavirus task force, said on Tuesday of Trump's Easter timeline. “You can look at a date but you’ve got to be very flexible and on a literally day-by-day and week-by-week basis. You need to evaluate the feasibility of what you’re trying to do."" The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. Dr. Thomas Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, warned that the U.S. is ""still at the beginning"" of the coronavirus outbreak, and outlined five conditions that must be met before the country should consider relaxing social distancing practices. Inglesby noted that a lot of the necessary information remains unknown, which makes it ""hard to predict"" a date for this, but pointed to the need for greater resources for medical professionals and signs of fewer cases in at least part of the country as necessary factors before life starts to go back to normal. TRUMP SAYS CORONAVIRUS QUARANTINE ON NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY, CONNECTICUT NOT NECESSARY, CDC ISSUES 14-DAY 'TRAVEL ADVISORY' “When we see a state or region have numbers that go down over time, and when we have diagnostics in place, and when we have masks available for all of our doctors and nurses who are putting their lives at risk to take care of sick patients, and hospitals are well-prepared, and when we can get our public health systems in place to start tracing or identifying individuals and start tracing their contacts, again like they do in Asia --- I think those five major conditions --- then I think it’s a time to begin to think about how we might experiment with lightening social distancing, perhaps one step at a time.” Based on what has happened elsewhere, Inglesby said the U.S. may have a better grasp of the situation in another two weeks. “At that point, I think we could begin to look for the conditions that might make it safe to begin to lower our social distancing, but not until then. While more information may be available by then, however, Inglesby reinforced the need for social distancing, as he believes the outbreak is still only in its early stages. CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE “I think unfortunately we are still at the beginning of this outbreak and we should expect that to continue for some time and really focus on social distancing as one of our main interventions in trying to slow it,” he said. Inglesby disagreed with President Trump’s suggestion that certain parts of the country that have not been hit as hard should begin resuming normal life soon. “At this point we are seeing numbers go up around the country pretty consistently — there isn’t really any place in the country where we are seeing numbers go down. And we wouldn’t expect to have had enough time for social distancing to change the numbers. So I don’t think we have had nearly enough time for these measures to take full effect.” The president stated that in some areas people would be able to go to work as long as they take social distancing precautions and remain vigilant about hygiene. When asked about whether this could be effective, Inglesby pointed to Italy as evidence for why it would not work. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP “I don’t think so,"" he said. ""I think we’ve seen in Italy, for example, which is a number of weeks ahead of the United States in terms of its epidemic, that even with very serious, very aggressive social distancing measures where people have been kept at home, schools have been closed, everyone is recommended not to leave their homes, that this disease has continued to spread and is causing national crisis.” Inglesby did say that when the situation sufficiently improves, some parts of the country could reopen sooner than others.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.  Sign up here. With the Big Apple now the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Sunday that critics should not be ""focusing"" on ""anything looking back on any level of government right now"" -- including his previous statements urging his constituents to go about their lives and not worry about the virus. On Jan. 24, de Blasio said New Yorkers should ""continue living as you have""; on Feb. 14 he said, ""this should not stop you from going about your life ... from going out to Chinatown and going out to eat""; and on March 13, he reiterated ""we wanted people to go on about their lives."" In an especially ill-advised March 2 tweet, de Blasio wrote: “Since I’m encouraging New Yorkers to go on with your lives + get out on the town despite Coronavirus, I thought I would offer some suggestions. Here’s the first: thru Thurs 3/5 go see “The Traitor” @FilmLinc. If “The Wire” was a true story + set in Italy, it would be this film.” The Trump administration restricted travel from China on Jan. 31 in response to the mounting coronavirus threat -- a move many Democrats and media outlets characterized as irresponsible and unnecessary. Confronted with his previous soundbites on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" de Blasio initially downplayed the comments before ultimately acknowledging that the questions were ""fair."" ""This is just about how we save lives going forward. Everyone was working with the information we had, and trying of course to avoid panic,"" de Blasio began. ""The bottom line is none of us have time to look backwards. I'm trying to figure out how we get through next Sunday, and what we do the week after that."" When anchor Jake Tapper reminded the mayor that he has harshly criticized President Trump's response to the crisis, de Blasio insisted that he had argued in real-time that coronavirus testing was insufficient. At the same time, de Blasio continued: ""There's no time to go back over that; there's only time to focus on getting through the next week and the week after that. You can ask all the questions you want. They're fair. But I think the time to deal with these questions is after this war is over. Because literally here in New York City, it feels like a wartime environment."" TRUMP SAYS NEW YORK STATE QUARANTINE NO LONGER NEEDED More than most other officials in de Blasio's administration, New York City Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot was likely to face those questions. Barbot remarked on Feb. 2: ""There is no reason not to take the subway, not to take the bus, not to go out to your favorite restaurant, and certainly not to miss the parade next Sunday.” Then, on Feb. 7: “We’re telling New Yorkers, go about your lives, take the subway, go out, enjoy life.""

Andrew Cuomo to call it illegal and “a federal declaration of war.” Meanwhile, Cuomo postponed New York's presidential primary from April to June, and nurses made anguished pleas for more protective equipment. All 50 U.S. states have reported some cases of the virus that causes COVID-19, but New York has the most, with over 52,000 positive tests for the illness and more than 700 deaths.

Larry Hogan does not agree with President Trump’s assertion that the country will be “opened up and just raring to go by Easter.” Hogan, a Republican, balked at the president’s hopeful assertion made last week that at least parts of the country could be operating like normal in two weeks’ time – saying in that time period “Maryland is going to look more like New York.” “The messaging isn’t helpful,” Hogan said during an interview on “Fox News Sunday” of the president’s comments regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. “The governors are out there on the front lines, are trying to get people to stay in their homes for everything but very essential things like going out to get food or prescriptions or things that are basic; you know, for them to survive, and then we got messaging coming out saying that things are OK and you should get back to normal. It does conflict and it hurts.” Hogan added: “We don’t want people to be scared, but we do want them to take it seriously and want, you know, the facts to be out there. So we’re going to follow the doctors and the scientists.” CORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN Hogan’s comments come as Maryland saw a sharp rise in the number of people infected by the coronavirus over the weekend, including 66 residents in one nursing home. While the number of people infected by the contagion in Maryland is still far less than in New York – currently the epicenter of the outbreak with more than 53,000 infected – Hogan announced that the number of deaths in the state related to the virus has doubled to 10, and there are now around 2,000 cases of the pathogen in the Washington, D.C., Capitol Region, which includes Maryland and Virginia.  “It took nearly three weeks for the National Capital Region to go from 0 to 1,000 cases of COVID-19,” Hogan said on Saturday. “It took three days for the region to go from 1,000 to 2,000 cases in Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Virginia. This is a rapidly evolving and escalating emergency which is now surrounding the nation’s capital.” CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE While much of the news of coronavirus has focused on New York – which accounts for over 40 percent of all coronavirus cases in the United States – the virus is beginning to hit other sections of the country hard as well. Cities like Chicago, New Orleans, Detroit and Los Angeles have seen recent surges in infections, and as the virus spreads further – and access to testing is still difficult to obtain in some parts of the country – officials say things will get worse before they get better. “I think the virus is going to dictate the timeframe and we’re going to follow the advice of the scientists and doctors,” Hogan said. “The big pinch point that everybody is dealing with both at the federal and all the states is this lack of the equipment that we need. It’s a lack of tests, a lack of ventilators, a lack of masks and swabs and protective equipment. This is a serious issue across the country that we’re all grappling with.”    ",         Maryland Gov.

Speaking at a contentious White House coronavirus news briefing on Sunday that involved testy standoffs with multiple reporters, President Trump declared that ""the peak in death rate"" in the coronavirus pandemic ""is likely to hit in two weeks,"" and said the federal government will be extending its social-distancing guidelines through April 30.PROGRAMMING ALERT: PRESIDENT TRUMP TO APPEAR ON ‘FOX & FRIENDS’ AT 8 AM ET""The modeling estimates that the peak in death rate is likely to hit in two weeks. I will say it again. The peak, the highest point of death rates, remember this, is likely to hit in two weeks... Therefore, we will be extending our guidelines to April 30, to slow the spread,"" the president said in the White House Rose Garden. Saying his earlier hope that the country could reopen by Easter was ""just an aspiration,"" Trump added: ""We can expect that by June 1, we will be well on our way to recovery"" and that ""a lot of great things will be happening."" When asked about worst-case scenarios if the country were to remain closed indefinitely, the president responded, ""You're gonna have large numbers of suicides -- tremendous [numbers of] suicides... You will see drugs being used like nobody has ever used them before, and people are going to be dying all over the place."" On a positive note, Trump went on to say that ""two of the country's largest health insurers -- Humana and Cigna -- have announced that they will waive copays, coinsurance, and deductibles for coronavirus treatments.""       President Donald Trump speaking during a coronavirus task-force briefing in the Rose Garden of the White House on Sunday. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)       In response to a question at the briefing, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, reiterated his estimate from earlier in the day that it remained possible that 100,000 to 200,000 people could die in the United States. ""What we’re trying to do is not let that happen,"" he said, calling the extension of social-distancing guidelines ""a wise and prudent decision."" Over 2,300 people with the virus already have died in the U.S. ""Models are good, but models often generate the kind of anxious question you asked,"" Fauci said, when a reporter asked how bad the situation could become. ""A model is as good as the assumptions you put into the model, and very often, many of these assumptions are based on a complexity of issues that aren't necessarily the same... from one country to another."" Fauci said the April 30 extension came after he, Dr. Deborah Birx and other members of the task force had made the recommendation. ""Why don't you people act a little more positively -- it's always get-you, get-you."" Trump said he'd seen early estimates that 2.2 million people could have died if the government had done nothing in a worst-case scenario, so ""if we can hold that down to 100,000"" or less, it would be a ""good job."" Had the country simply ridden the virus ""like a cowboy"" and driven ""that sucker right through,"" the president insisted, disaster would have unfolded. Separately, Trump openly questioned why the demand for surgical masks has skyrocketed in New York City and elsewhere, urging assembled reporters that they ""oughtta look into it"" because ""something's going on."" The head-turning moment came just hours after Trump touted the sky-high ratings for his coronavirus press briefings, and shortly after New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio urged his constituents not to ""look back"" on his prior statements downplaying the coronavirus. ""How do you go from 10 to 20 to 30,000, to 300,000 [masks] -- even though this is different,"" Trump asked. ""Something is going on, and you ought to look into it as reporters. Where are the masks going? Are they going out the back door? How do you go from 10,000 to 300,000? And, we have that in a lot of different places. So, somebody should probably look into that. I just don’t see from a practical standpoint how that's possible to go from that to that, and we have that happening in numerous places."" Pressed on the matter later at the briefing, Trump called on New Yorkers to ""check"" Gov. Andrew Cuomo and de Blasio, both Democrats, about the changing mask numbers. ""People should check them, because there's something going on."" He asserted that it could be ""something worse than hoarding."" Cuomo said earlier this month that some people were stealing medical supplies. ""Not just people taking a couple or three, I mean just actual thefts of those products,"" Cuomo said. ""I've asked the state police to do an investigation, look at places that are selling masks, medical equipment, protective wear, feeding the anxiety."" Nevertheless, a CNN ""fact-check"" reporter, among others, accused Trump of making his claim without ""evidence."" DE BLASIO: PAY NO ATTENTION TO MY PREVIOUS CORONAVIRUS REMARKS Furious nurses staged protests outside of Jacobi Hospital’s emergency room in the Bronx over the weekend, claiming there was a dangerous shortage of masks and gloves there. Sean Petty, a pediatric nurse at the hospital, told the New York Post: 'We need billions of N95 masks. This policy that was put out by the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] is killing nurses. We already lost our first nurse in New York City. We’re gonna lose more.” Trump remarked that ""many of the states are stocked up"" on various critical supplies including ventilators -- although, he added, ""some don't admit it."" Later, Trump suggested that ""there's a question as to hoarding of ventilators"" in which some hospitals may be keeping the devices in case of a major problem in the future. Also at the briefing, Trump unloaded after PBS News' Yamiche Alcindor -- a frequent Trump antagonist who previously has asked numerous questions during coronavirus briefings about whether an unnamed administration official really used the term ""Kung Flu"" --  began with another critical query about Trump's past comments to Fox News on New York's demands or ventilators. Specifically, Alcindor accused Trump of saying that governors were requesting equipment they ""don't actually need."" In fact, Trump said that in some cases, ""equipment's being asked for that I don't think they'll need"" by the end of the pandemic. Alcindor doubled down when Trump pushed back on her characterization of his comments. ""Why don't you people act a little more positively -- it's always trying to get-you, get-you, get you,"" Trump responded. ""And you know what? That's why nobody trusts the media anymore. That's why you used to work for the Times and now you work for somebody else. Let me tell you something: Be nice. Don't be threatening. Be nice."" That confrontation prompted another wave of sympathy for Alcindor among left-wing journalists. Alcindor herself complained on social media that she was unfairly victimized by the president. (""I’m not the first human being, woman, black person or journalist to be told that while doing a job,"" she wrote.) Minutes later, Trump tusseled with CNN reporter Jeremy Diamond, who alleged the president had definitively said on Friday that he'd cut off communications with governors who weren't appreciative of his coronavirus efforts. Trump shot back that Washington state's governor, Democrat Jay Inslee, was a ""nasty"" person, and reiterated that Vice President Mike Pence would remain in open communications even with hostile governors. ""Your statement is a lie,"" Trump said flatly. Trump slammed Diamond for omitting a portion of Trump's quote in which Trump said governors and local officials needed to appreciate the broader federal disaster relief effort, not just Trump's own initiatives. ""We lift up their ratings, because their ratings are very low,"" Trump said, explaining why CNN had sent Diamond to the briefing even though some network figures have expressed open disdain for the president. ""I’m well aware that Trump has made plenty of mistakes handling this crisis,"" wrote The National Review's Alexandra DeSanctis after the briefing.""I’d just like to know how the media baiting him and alternating between throwing themselves pity parties and patting each other on the back improves that situation. These Gallup numbers [showing declining media popularity] are not a fluke."" For the most part, however, the president largely sounded positive notes as to practical developments over the past 24 hours of the crisis. HOW LONG WILL CORONAVIRUS LAST IN THE US? In addition to the waived copays and deductibles, Trump touted ""some interesting"" therapeutics that ""will be announced over the next few weeks."" He said he has been working on getting a system that could sterilize health-care workers' masks up to 20 times more quickly approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Trump went on to praise the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA] for turning New York City's Javits Center into a makeshift emergency hospital. ""It's an incredible, complex, top-of-the-line hospital. Everyone's trying to figure out how they did it,"" Trump said, noting that he was also unsure. ""And, I was a good builder.""

"                          Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Twelve days ago, General Motors put hundreds of workers on an urgent project to build breathing machines as hospitals and governors pleaded for more in response to the coronavirus pandemic. But President Trump, claiming the company wasn't moving fast enough, on Friday invoked the Defense Production Act, which gives the government broad authority to direct companies to meet national defense needs. (Ventec) Experts on managing factory production say GM is already making an extraordinary effort for a company that normally isn't in the business of producing ventilators. “That is lightning-fast speed to secure suppliers, learn how the products work, and make space in their manufacturing plant. You can’t get much faster than that,” said Kaitlin Wowak, a professor at the University of Notre Dame who focuses on industrial supply chains. THE BEST WAY TO KILL CORONAVIRUS IN CARS GM expects to produce ventilators at a rate of 10,000 per month starting in mid-April. The company is working with Ventec Life Systems, a small Seattle-area ventilator maker, and both say the Defense Production Act of 1950 doesn’t change what they’re doing because they’re already moving as fast as they can, fronting millions in capital with an uncertain return. (GM) “I don’t think anybody could have done it faster,” said Gerald Johnson, GM's global manufacturing chief. Peter Navarro, Trump’s assistant for manufacturing policy, said Saturday that invoking the act was needed because GM “dragged its heels for days"" in committing to the investments to start making ventilators at an automotive electronics plant in Kokomo, Ind. It was only a few days earlier that Trump had been holding up GM and Ford as examples of companies voluntarily responding to the outbreak without the need for him to invoke the act. Then on Friday, he slammed GM on Twitter and during his daily briefing for foot-dragging. On Sunday, he was back to praising the company during another briefing: “General Motors is doing a fantastic job. I don't think we have to worry about them anymore.” But GM says it had been proceeding on the same course all along. (GM) The company got into the ventilator business on March 18 after being approached by stopthespread.org, a coalition of CEOs trying to organize companies to respond to the COVID-19 disease that has already claimed more than 30,000 lives globally. The organization introduced GM to Ventec, which makes small portable ventilators in Bothell, Washington. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW The automaker pulled together manufacturing experts, engineers and purchasing specialists, and the next day had people at Ventec’s facility, a short distance from a nursing home where the virus killed at least 35 people. They worked on speeding up Ventec’s manufacturing. A few days later, GM assigned more engineers and purchasing experts to figure out how it could make Ventec’s machines. Some Ventec parts makers couldn’t produce enough widgets fast enough, so GM went to its own parts bin to find suppliers to do the job, Johnson said. (GM) Erik Gordon, a University of Michigan law and business professor, said he thought Trump would commend GM and use it as an example for other manufacturers in the coronavirus fight. “What came out was a smack on the head,” he said. Gordon, who teaches a class in commercialization of biomedical goods, said Trump likely will claim credit when GM starts making the machines. “This is an election year, and on all sides you’re going to see political theater,” he said. Critics have urged Trump to invoke the Defense Production Act broadly to control the production, supply and distribution of ventilators and protective gear for hospital workers who are running short. That’s what the act was meant to do, and it was not for use against a single company, Gordon said. Even with increased production from all ventilator makers, however, the U.S. might not have enough of the life-saving machines. U.S. hospitals have about 65,000 of the ventilators that are sophisticated enough to treat critical coronavirus patients. It could probably cobble together a total of 170,000, including simpler devices, to help with the crisis, one expert says. A doctor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center estimates that 960,000 people in the U.S. will need to be on ventilators, which feed oxygen into the lungs of patients with severe respiratory problems through a tube inserted down the throat. Doctors hope social distancing will stop a huge number of people from getting sick simultaneously, flattening the curve of the illness so they can use one ventilator to treat multiple patients. Trump, in several appearances Friday, accused GM of promising 40,000 ventilators, then reducing the number to 6,000. He also said the company wanted higher prices than previously discussed. Ventec, which is negotiating with the government to provide more ventilators, said it only changed numbers and prices at the request of government agencies, which asked for a range of quantities and prices. The company said it’s selling the ventilators, which can treat severe virus patients, at distributor cost, and it has offered scaled down versions for a lower price. Up until late Sunday, Ventec and GM hadn't known how many ventilators the government would buy but those details are now being worked out. Ventec isn’t sure if it will make any money on the devices, which generally sell for $18,000 — far less than ventilators used in hospital intensive care units that can cost $50,000.

Former NBA All-Star Stephon Marbury is working on a deal with a Chinese N95 mask supplier to bring 10 million masks to hospital workers and other first responders in New York City, as they work to battle the coronavirus in the hardest-hit city in the U.S. Marbury told the New York Post on Sunday that the Chinese supplier would be willing to sell the masks “at cost,” which is $2.75 each. According to the newspaper, other retails have been supplying the state masks at $7.50 per mask. NEW YORK KNICKS OWNER JAMES DOLAN TESTS POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS “At the end of the day, I am from Brooklyn,” the Chinese Basketball Association legend told the newspaper. “This is something that is close and dear to my heart as far as being able to help New York. “I have family there in Coney Island, a lot of family … who are affected by this, so I know how important it is for people to have masks during this time.” Marbury played in the NBA for 13 seasons among the Minnesota Timberwolves, New Jersey Nets, Phoenix Suns, New York Knicks, and Boston Celtics. He played in China from 2009 to 2013 before becoming a head coach in the same professional basketball league. RUDY GOBERT, DONOVAN MITCHELL, UTAH JAZZ STAFF CLEARED OF CORONAVIRUS The 43-year-old former point guard’s efforts have been hampered by obstacles, according to the New York Post. Marbury said he reached out to Brooklyn borough president Eric Adams to help coordinate the sale. Marbury and Adams have a rapport, with the city official backing the player’s charities in the city. Adams told the Post he was initially told by city and state officials New York did not need the masks. However, when the newspaper connected with New York State Department of Health officials, they said they wanted to speak with Marbury about getting the masks. It appeared city officials are still working on coordinating with Adams and Marbury. Marbury appeared to be in New York City about four days ago, posting a video of himself with a mask around his face.

Wearing a mask is so important during this #coronavirus pandemic if we must be out and about. The quarantine has purpose so we can help the infected and protect the healthy. The virus is the invisible killer. It has no heart or compassion as we’re all exposed. I too have family members exposed to this virus. No one is exempt as we see people of all statue infected by this virus. The only way to move pass this is through it together.” Throughout New York, there have been at least 59,500 coronavirus cases with at least 960 deaths of Sunday.

"                          White House: President Trump and the coronavirus task force gave updates. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. Speaking at a contentious White House coronavirus news briefing on Sunday that involved testy standoffs with multiple reporters, President Trump declared that ""the peak in death rate"" in the coronavirus pandemic ""is likely to hit in two weeks,"" and said the federal government will be extending its social-distancing guidelines through April 30.PROGRAMMING ALERT: PRESIDENT TRUMP TO APPEAR ON ‘FOX & FRIENDS’ AT 8 AM ET""The modeling estimates that the peak in death rate is likely to hit in two weeks. I will say it again. The peak, the highest point of death rates, remember this, is likely to hit in two weeks... Therefore, we will be extending our guidelines to April 30, to slow the spread,"" the president said in the White House Rose Garden. Saying his earlier hope that the country could reopen by Easter was ""just an aspiration,"" Trump added: ""We can expect that by June 1, we will be well on our way to recovery"" and that ""a lot of great things will be happening."" When asked about worst-case economic scenarios if the country were to remain closed indefinitely, the president responded, ""You're gonna have large numbers of suicides -- tremendous [numbers of] suicides... You will see drugs being used like nobody has ever used them before, and people are going to be dying all over the place."" On a positive note, Trump went on to say that ""two of the country's largest health insurers -- Humana and Cigna -- have announced that they will waive copays, coinsurance, and deductibles for coronavirus treatments.""       President Donald Trump speaking during a coronavirus task-force briefing in the Rose Garden of the White House on Sunday. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)       In response to a question at the briefing, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, reiterated his estimate from earlier in the day that it remained possible that 100,000 to 200,000 people could die in the United States. ""What we’re trying to do is not let that happen,"" he said, calling the extension of social-distancing guidelines ""a wise and prudent decision."" Over 2,300 people with the virus already have died in the U.S. ""Models are good, but models often generate the kind of anxious question you asked,"" Fauci said, when a reporter asked how bad the situation could become. ""A model is as good as the assumptions you put into the model, and very often, many of these assumptions are based on a complexity of issues that aren't necessarily the same... from one country to another."" Fauci said the April 30 extension came after he, Dr. Deborah Birx and other members of the task force had made the recommendation. ""Why don't you people act a little more positively -- it's always get-you, get-you."" Trump said he'd seen early estimates that 2.2 million people could have died if the government had done nothing in a worst-case scenario, so ""if we can hold that down to 100,000"" or less, it would be a ""good job."" Had the country simply ridden the virus ""like a cowboy"" and driven ""that sucker right through,"" the president insisted, disaster would have unfolded. Separately, Trump openly questioned why the demand for surgical masks has skyrocketed in New York City and elsewhere, urging assembled reporters that they ""oughtta look into it"" because ""something's going on."" The head-turning moment came just hours after Trump touted the sky-high ratings for his coronavirus press briefings, and shortly after New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio urged his constituents not to ""look back"" on his prior statements downplaying the coronavirus. ""How do you go from 10 to 20 to 30,000, to 300,000 [masks] -- even though this is different,"" Trump asked. ""Something is going on, and you ought to look into it as reporters. Where are the masks going? Are they going out the back door? How do you go from 10,000 to 300,000? And, we have that in a lot of different places. So, somebody should probably look into that. I just don’t see from a practical standpoint how that's possible to go from that to that, and we have that happening in numerous places."" Pressed on the matter later at the briefing, Trump called on New Yorkers to ""check"" Gov. Andrew Cuomo and de Blasio, both Democrats, about the changing mask numbers. ""People should check them, because there's something going on."" He asserted that it could be ""something worse than hoarding."" Cuomo said earlier this month that some people were stealing medical supplies. ""Not just people taking a couple or three, I mean just actual thefts of those products,"" Cuomo said. ""I've asked the state police to do an investigation, look at places that are selling masks, medical equipment, protective wear, feeding the anxiety."" Nevertheless, a CNN ""fact-check"" reporter, among others, accused Trump of making his claim without ""evidence."" DE BLASIO: PAY NO ATTENTION TO MY PREVIOUS CORONAVIRUS REMARKS Furious nurses staged protests outside of Jacobi Hospital’s emergency room in the Bronx over the weekend, claiming there was a dangerous shortage of masks and gloves there. Sean Petty, a pediatric nurse at the hospital, told the New York Post: 'We need billions of N95 masks. This policy that was put out by the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] is killing nurses. We already lost our first nurse in New York City. We’re gonna lose more.” Trump remarked that ""many of the states are stocked up"" on various critical supplies including ventilators -- although, he added, ""some don't admit it."" Later, Trump suggested that ""there's a question as to hoarding of ventilators"" in which some hospitals may be keeping the devices in case of a major problem in the future. Also at the briefing, Trump unloaded after PBS News' Yamiche Alcindor -- a frequent Trump antagonist who previously has asked numerous questions during coronavirus briefings about whether an unnamed administration official really used the term ""Kung Flu"" --  began with another critical query about Trump's past comments to Fox News on New York's demands or ventilators. Specifically, Alcindor accused Trump of saying that governors were requesting equipment they ""don't actually need."" In fact, Trump said that in some cases, ""equipment's being asked for that I don't think they'll need"" by the end of the pandemic. Alcindor doubled down when Trump pushed back on her characterization of his comments. ""Why don't you people act a little more positively -- it's always trying to get-you, get-you, get you,"" Trump responded. ""And you know what? That's why nobody trusts the media anymore. That's why you used to work for the Times and now you work for somebody else. Let me tell you something: Be nice. Don't be threatening. Be nice."" That confrontation prompted another wave of sympathy for Alcindor among left-wing journalists. Alcindor herself complained on social media that she was unfairly victimized by the president. (""I’m not the first human being, woman, black person or journalist to be told that while doing a job,"" she wrote.) Minutes later, Trump tusseled with CNN reporter Jeremy Diamond, who alleged the president had definitively said on Friday that he'd cut off communications with governors who weren't appreciative of his coronavirus efforts. Trump shot back that Washington state's governor, Democrat Jay Inslee, was a ""nasty"" person, and reiterated that Vice President Mike Pence would remain in open communications even with hostile governors. ""Your statement is a lie,"" Trump said flatly. Trump slammed Diamond for omitting a portion of Trump's quote in which Trump said governors and local officials needed to appreciate the broader federal disaster relief effort, not just Trump's own initiatives. ""We lift up their ratings, because their ratings are very low,"" Trump said, explaining why CNN had sent Diamond to the briefing even though some network figures have expressed open disdain for the president. ""I’m well aware that Trump has made plenty of mistakes handling this crisis,"" wrote The National Review's Alexandra DeSanctis after the briefing.""I’d just like to know how the media baiting him and alternating between throwing themselves pity parties and patting each other on the back improves that situation. These Gallup numbers [showing declining media popularity] are not a fluke."" For the most part, however, the president largely sounded positive notes as to practical developments over the past 24 hours of the crisis. HOW LONG WILL CORONAVIRUS LAST IN THE US? In addition to the waived copays and deductibles, Trump touted ""some interesting"" therapeutics that ""will be announced over the next few weeks."" He said he has been working on getting a system that could sterilize health-care workers' masks up to 20 times more quickly approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Trump went on to praise the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA] for turning New York City's Javits Center into a makeshift emergency hospital. ""It's an incredible, complex, top-of-the-line hospital. Everyone's trying to figure out how they did it,"" Trump said, noting that he was also unsure. ""And, I was a good builder."" The president maintained distance from other speakers at the briefing, and referenced social-distancing guidelines as soon as he took to the podium. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""Appreciate everybody being here -- beautiful day in the Rose Garden,"" Trump remarked as the press conference began. ""Tremendous distance between chairs."" ""We're all in this together -- all us of us,"" Trump said at the conclusion of the briefing. ""I've never seen anything like it. It's a beautiful thing to watch. Unfortunately, the enemy is death, so it's very unpleasant. But, the level of competence, the level of caring, the level of love -- I just think it's brilliant. ... I'm very proud to be your president.""

It is a given in politics that an incumbent has the advantage until things go wrong, at which point the challenger gets an edge. Then why, amidst panic, death and economic shutdown, is Joe Biden looking like the sick man of 2020? Biden’s predicament is odd considering a key pillar of Donald Trump’s presidency — record low unemployment — is being vaporized. Thursday’s 3.3 million new unemployment claims wiped out nearly half the jobs created in the last three years, and the worst is yet to come.

""The good news was the outbreak basically ended their nominating contest,"" said Stirewalt, referencing former Vice President Joe Biden's victories in the March 17 primaries in Illinois, Florida and Arizona. ""He [Biden] was a decisive winner, the sentiment against [Sen.] Bernie Sanders [I-Vt.] in all quarters of the Democratic Party has been robustly in opposition, Sanders had more than worn out his welcome, and with this [outbreak] going on, Democrats were quite content to say, 'This is done.'"" However, Stirewalt added that the focus on the coronavirus and the Trump administration's response to the pandemic has left Biden ""adrift"" for several weeks. ""That's a long time to leave Joe Biden on the shelf,"" said Stirewalt, who described Biden as a ""weak presumptive nominee."" ""Biden just looks dreadful, right?"" Stirewalt added. ""He's coming to you from his basement. Biden isn't a good interview. He can do pretty well on a speech ... He's good on one-on-one interaction, retail politics. But for what's called for here, he is just not suited for it."" Stirewalt also discussed the impact of the pandemic on Trump's reelection chances. ""Donald Trump has been extraordinarily lucky, or had been extraordinarily lucky, through the more than three years of his term,"" he said. ""There were no major international crises or incidents.

President Trump, in an extensive interview Monday with “Fox & Friends,” predicted coronavirus cases in the U.S. will likely peak “around Easter” as he defended his administration’s decision to extend strict social distancing guidelines through the end of April – suggesting millions of lives could be saved by the measures. The president also slammed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., in response to her charge on Sunday that people are dying as he ""fiddles."" ""She’s a sick puppy in my opinion,"" Trump said. The president, bristling at Pelosi's characterization, argued that the measures being taken are in fact saving lives. “We’re doing a lot of things and we don’t want to [ease restrictions] too soon,” Trump said. “Around Easter, that's going to be the highest point, we think.” Trump added: “We think April 30 is a day where we can see some real progress. And we expect to see that, short of June 1, we think the death, it’s a terrible thing to say, will be brought to a very low number.” The president’s comments on “Fox & Friends” come after he extended the administration’s social-distancing guidelines through April 30. Earlier this month, Trump and the White House Coronavirus Task Force introduced the initial guidelines, titled “15 days to slow the spread,” which detailed social-distancing rules to limit social gatherings, minimize person-to-person contact and urge millions of Americans to stay at home as much as possible. Those guidelines were slated to expire Monday. The president also had stirred controversy by floating the possibility of reopening shuttered businesses and easing restrictions generally by Easter. His announcement Sunday made clear that he is no longer considering that course. On Monday, he said the guidance he received from top health officials was that between 1.6 million and 2.2 million people could have died without restrictions, even as they lead to enormous economic strain for those who have been laid off in response to business closures. Trump described these steps as necessary. ""If we didn’t do anything, 2.2 million people could have died,"" Trump said on ""Fox & Friends."" ""The worst thing we can do is declare victory ... and then not have victory,"" Trump continued. ""We're at war, this is war."" The president spoke at a time when the U.S. has overtaken every other country in terms of reported coronavirus cases, with the number of deaths also spiking in recent days. As of Monday morning, more than 2,500 people in the U.S. have died, among more than 143,000 cases reported. Trump suggested that the high number of cases could be due in part to increased testing, saying, “We test more than anybody else.” He also said the U.S. has a “very low mortality rate” compared with other countries. Trump further said that new testing that produces quick results could be ready as early as this week. The president, meanwhile, continued to wage a political battle with Pelosi, after the House speaker slammed him Sunday on CNN. She had said his “denial at the beginning was deadly, his delaying of equipment…to where it is needed is deadly, and now the best thing would be to do is prevent more loss of life, rather than open things up so that, because we just don’t know.” “As the president fiddles, people are dying,” Pelosi said. “We just have to take every precaution.” The president hit back Monday, saying “there’s something wrong with the woman.” “All she did for the first long time was impeach, impeach, impeach,” Trump said. “That’s all she did. She’s controlled by the radical left, by AOC plus 3, for her to make a statement like that, I think it’s a disgrace, to her country and her family.” “She focused on impeachment and she lost, and she looked like a fool,” he said.

It is a given in politics that an incumbent has the advantage until things go wrong, at which point the challenger gets an edge. Then why, amidst panic, death and economic shutdown, is Joe Biden looking like the sick man of 2020? Biden’s predicament is odd considering a key pillar of Donald Trump’s presidency — record low unemployment — is being vaporized.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. President Trump, in an extensive interview Monday with “Fox & Friends,” predicted coronavirus cases in the U.S. will likely peak “around Easter” as he defended his administration’s decision to extend strict social distancing guidelines through the end of April – suggesting millions of lives could be saved by the measures. The president also slammed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., in response to her charge on Sunday that people are dying as he ""fiddles."" PELOSI SAYS TRUMP HAS DOWNPLAYED CORONAVIRUS ""She’s a sick puppy, in my opinion,"" Trump said. The president, bristling at Pelosi's characterization, argued that the measures being taken are in fact saving lives. “We’re doing a lot of things and we don’t want to [ease restrictions] too soon,” Trump said. “Around Easter, that's going to be the highest point, we think.” Trump added: “We think April 30 is a day where we can see some real progress. And we expect to see that, short of June 1, we think the death, it’s a terrible thing to say, will be brought to a very low number.” The president’s comments on “Fox & Friends” come after he extended the administration’s social-distancing guidelines through April 30. Earlier this month, Trump and the White House Coronavirus Task Force introduced the initial guidelines, titled “15 days to slow the spread,” which detailed social-distancing rules to limit social gatherings, minimize person-to-person contact and urge millions of Americans to stay at home as much as possible. Those guidelines were slated to expire Monday. TRUMP EXTENDS SOCIAL DISTANCING GUIDELINES THROUGH END OF APRIL The president also had stirred controversy by floating the possibility of reopening shuttered businesses and easing restrictions generally by Easter. His announcement Sunday made clear that he is no longer considering that course. On Monday, he said the guidance he received from top health officials was that between 1.6 million and 2.2 million people could have died without restrictions, even as they lead to enormous economic strain for those who have been laid off in response to business closures. Trump described these steps as necessary. ""If we didn’t do anything, 2.2 million people could have died,"" Trump said on ""Fox & Friends."" ""The worst thing we can do is declare victory ... and then not have victory,"" Trump continued. ""We're at war, this is war."" The president spoke at a time when the U.S. has overtaken every other country in terms of reported coronavirus cases, with the number of deaths also spiking in recent days. As of Monday morning, more than 2,500 people in the U.S. have died, among more than 143,000 cases reported. Trump suggested that the high number of cases could be due in part to increased testing, saying, “We test more than anybody else.” He also said the U.S. has a “very low mortality rate” compared with other countries. Trump further said that new testing that produces quick results could be ready as early as this week. The president, meanwhile, continued to wage a political battle with Pelosi, after the House speaker slammed him Sunday on CNN. She had said his “denial at the beginning was deadly, his delaying of equipment…to where it is needed is deadly, and now the best thing would be to do is prevent more loss of life, rather than open things up so that, because we just don’t know.” “As the president fiddles, people are dying,” Pelosi said. “We just have to take every precaution.” The president hit back Monday, saying “there’s something wrong with the woman.” “All she did for the first long time was impeach, impeach, impeach,” Trump said. “That’s all she did. She’s controlled by the radical left, by AOC plus 3, for her to make a statement like that, I think it’s a disgrace, to her country and her family.” “She focused on impeachment and she lost, and she looked like a fool,” he said.

President Trump took another swipe at former Vice President Joe Biden on Monday, saying that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo “probably” would make for a better 2020 Democratic presidential candidate. During a wide-ranging interview with “Fox & Friends,” the president detailed his administration’s latest actions in their response to the coronavirus pandemic. Biden for days has criticized Trump's response to the crisis, and the most recent Fox News Poll shows the likely Democratic presidential nominee holding a 9-point lead over Trump in a hypothetical general election match-up. CUOMO'S PROFILE RISES AMID CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK “If Sleepy Joe was president, he wouldn’t even know what’s going on,” Trump shot back Monday. The president was asked about reports of some in the Democratic field suggesting Cuomo should run for the Democratic nomination instead. “If he’s gonna run, that’s fine, I’ve known Andrew for a long time,” Trump said. “I think he’d be a better candidate than Sleepy Joe.” ""I wouldn’t mind running against Andrew,” Trump said. “I don’t mind running against Joe Biden.” He added: “I think probably Andrew would be better.” TRUMP SAYS CORONAVIRUS TO PEAK 'AROUND EASTER'  Cuomo, the three-term governor of New York, which has been hit the hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic, has become a fixture in the national media with his daily coronavirus briefings. Cuomo has received bipartisan praise, even from Biden, for his response in New York and leadership. Cuomo has brushed aside campaign speculation as he combats the coronavirus in his state. Cuomo announced Sunday that he is extending a statewide lockdown that he first ordered earlier this month, forcing nonessential workers to remain at home due to the coronavirus outbreak at least through April 15.  Meanwhile, the president predicted coronavirus cases in the U.S. will likely peak “around Easter” as he defended his administration’s decision to extend strict social distancing guidelines through the end of April – suggesting millions of lives could be saved by the measures. “We’re doing a lot of things and we don’t want to do it too soon,” Trump said early Monday. “Around Easter is going to be your spike, we think, and then it’s going to start coming down from there.” Trump added: “We think April 30 is a day where we can see some real progress. And we expect to see that, short of June 1, we think the death, it’s a terrible thing to say, will be brought to a very low number.”    ",         Trump trolls Biden,         2020-03-30T090137-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/trump-trolls-biden-says-cuomo-probably-would-be-better-2020-candidate,Fox

Valentina StellaMaris Duffy was born in October, one month before her actual due date.  She was also born with two holes in her heart that had to be surgically repaired.

When ambulances were backlogged due to the coronavirus outbreak Sunday, two New York City police officers helped a pregnant woman give birth inside her Bronx apartment, unwrapping the umbilical cord from the child’s neck and safely placing the baby girl into her mother’s arms.  Officers Nicholas Torrisi, 27, and Joseph Feger, 29, both of the 47th Precinct, were about an hour into their shift when they received the 911 call at about 12:40 a.m. They arrived to find a 31-year-old woman, whose name was not released, going into labor in the bedroom of her first-floor apartment in the Wakefield neighborhood in the Bronx.        Officers Nicholas Torrisi, 27, and Joseph Feger, 29, both of the 47th Precinct in the Bronx.      (NYPD) “We requested an ambulance to the location. But basically, we couldn’t get an estimated time of arrival,"" Torrisi told the New York Daily News. “They had a backlog from everything that’s going right now, the whole coronavirus thing. There were no ambulances available at the time.” CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE The officers planned to transport the woman to the hospital themselves but had no time.  “She was obviously going into labor contractions weren’t very far apart,” Torrisi told the New York Post. “We kind of braced ourselves on either side of her, holding her hand and trying to, you know, reassure her, like, ‘Miss Come on push… you can do it right, we’re here for you.'” The woman’s friend who was with her when the officers arrived said she could see the baby’s head coming out, prompting the officers to switch gears. The friend grabbed one of the woman’s hands, Feger the other. Torrisi then changed positions to prepare to deliver the child.  “I was probably the most nervous person in the room. The mom was doing really well,” Feger said.  The baby was delivered less than 15 minutes after the officers first responded to the 911 call.  CHICAGO INFANT DIES AFTER TESTING POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS, GOVERNOR SAYS  The woman “gave a few pushes, the head of the baby came out,"" Torrisi told the Daily News. ""When the head came out, the umbilical cord was actually around the child’s neck, and I was moving the child to get the cord from around the neck. “At that point, I had the baby in my hands and I said, ‘Oh, look. You got a beautiful baby girl.’” “I’ve never delivered a baby before in my life,” Torrisi continued. “I was, like, ecstatic. I’ve never felt anything like that in my life, holding a baby that was just born. It’s kind of indescribable.” “Early this morning, these @NYPD47Pct police officers responded to a call for a woman in labor.

"                          New York Governor Andrew Cuomo provides updates on the coronavirus response. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s poll numbers are soaring as he takes center stage in the response to the coronavirus pandemic. Eighty-seven percent of registered voters in New York state say they approve of the job he’s doing steering the state’s efforts in combating the crisis, according to a Siena College poll released Monday. Even 70 percent of Republicans in New York give Cuomo a thumbs-up on the job he’s doing. TRUMP SAYS CUOMO WOULD BE BETTER CANDIDATE THAN BIDEN  New York has become the country’s epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, which has swept the globe. According to the state’s department of health, New York had nearly 60,000 cases of COVID-19 – the disease spread by the coronavirus – as of Sunday afternoon. Cuomo’s daily news conferences – in which he projects a steady tone mixed with a healthy dose of empathy and personal stories – have been televised on a daily basis live on all three major cable news networks, giving the three-term Democratic governor plenty of national and international attention.  The governor’s efforts dealing with the coronavirus outbreak have also boosted his overall approval rating, which jumped 27 percentage points in just a month to 71 percent, his highest level since 2013 in Siena polling. Cuomo’s tangled with President Trump a couple of times the past few weeks, particularly over his urgent requests for the federal government to supply more ventilators to those desperately in need of the lifesaving machines that help severe coronavirus patients breath. Trump’s approval rating on the job he’s doing handling the federal response to the pandemic stood at just 41 percent among New Yorkers. Cuomo’s media blitz comes as former Vice President Joe Biden – the all-but-certain Democratic presidential nominee – struggles to increase his media footprint that was instantly erased as the coronavirus outbreak wiped the White House race from the headlines and froze the Democratic nomination battle in place. Without any formal current role in government, Biden has no direct role in combating the crisis and has been overshadowed both by Trump’s daily briefings as well as Cuomo’s media rise the past two weeks. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN  Cuomo’s soaring national media profile has some suggesting the New York governor would make for a better Democratic presidential candidate. “#PresidentCuomo,” “#DraftCuomo,” and “#AndrewforAmerica” hashtags have popped up on Twitter and there’s now a @DraftCuomo2020 Twitter handle. But talk of a potential Cuomo draft movement is just talk right now. Cuomo’s brushed aside campaign hypotheticals as he combats the coronavirus in his state, and the odds against him getting drafted as his party’s presidential nominee this late in the process are steep. Cuomo made it clear when he was running for re-election to a third-term in 2018 that he wouldn’t run for president in 2020. But Trump, in an appearance Monday morning on ""Fox & Friends,"" said: “I wouldn’t mind running against Andrew.”  And comparing Cuomo to Biden, the president said “I think probably Andrew would be better” as a candidate.

President Trump has extended national coronavirus social distancing guidelines until April 30, citing the possibility that 200,000 Americans could die from the pandemic that's largely shut down everyday life as people stay home from work, school and social engagements to try to slow the spread of the disease. The reversal by the president, who previously had said he hoped the U.S. economy could restart by Easter and continues to push for the social distancing guidelines to be lifted as soon as possible, is a reality check that a return to business as usual is not imminent for either the American people -- or the 2020 presidential campaign. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW Just as Americans' everyday lives have been upended, so has the presidential election season. There are no raucous Trump rallies. States continue to postpone their presidential primary elections one by one, putting the Democratic presidential nominating contest on ice for now. The highest-profile Democrat in the country isn't the probable Democratic presidential nominee but New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, whose daily press briefings have become must-see T.V. And that probable Democratic nominee -- former Vice President Joe Biden -- is doing a combination of TV interviews, live-streamed briefings and now a podcast to try and break through. TRUMP BLASTS REPORTER AT CORONAVIRUS BRIEFING: 'DON'T BE THREATENING, BE NICE' Biden spoke to Americans in personal terms in one recent interview, recalling his own family tragedies as he discussed how families can cope with loss during this crisis. ""I've lost a couple children, I've lost a wife and it is incredibly difficult to go through, and it is harder to go through when you haven't had an opportunity to be with the person while they're dying,"" Biden said in response to a grim question from CNN's Anderson Cooper last week on what people should do if they can't attend a loved one's funeral due to the coronavirus. ""My deceased wife -- I was not able to do that... I was not able to be there,"" Biden continued, visibly choking up as he spoke from the home studio built to allow him to give interviews and make speeches without exposing himself to the dangerous virus. ""... Seek help afterward. Seek help to talk to people who have been through it so they know, they know, they can tell you that you can get through it."" Biden is also holding his own briefings on the coronavirus pandemic which are streamed online and, according to NBC News, launching a podcast to contribute ""a voice of clarity during uncertain times."" Meanwhile, Trump is still Trump. He tangles with reporters. He tweets. He gave a fiery interview Monday morning on ""Fox & Friends."" But Democratic governors and legislators who are criticizing the federal government's pandemic response have largely replaced ""sleepy Joe"" --as Trump calls Biden--as the subject of the president's online barbs. In Trump's Monday morning appearance on ""Fox & Friends,"" the only explicit mention of the 2020 campaign was a discussion of whether Cuomo, whose handling of the pandemic has been widely applauded, would make a better Democratic nominee than Biden. (Trump said Cuomo would indeed be better.) NEW HOUSE REPORT INDICATES RELUCTANCE ON REMOTE VOTING DURING CORONAVIRUS CRISIS Most of the president's attacks on the morning show Monday were directed at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for her criticism of the administration's coronavirus response. ""It's a sad thing. Look, she's a sick puppy in my opinion,"" Trump said of Pelosi's criticism before touting his decision to stop travel from China to the U.S. in January. ""That's a horrible thing to say especially when I was the one ... I stopped some very, very infected, very, very sick people, thousands coming in from China long earlier than anybody thought... And I stopped everybody. We stopped it cold. It had never been done before."" And Trump's barbs at the media now happen largely in the context of White House coronavirus task force briefings rather than from the stage of packed campaign rallies.       Trump campaign rally.        TRUMP SAYS CORONAVIRUS 'PEAK IN DEATH RATE' LIKELY IN 2 WEEKS, EXTENDS SOCIAL-DISTANCING GUIDELINES THROUGH APRIL 30 ""Why don't you people act a little more positively -- it's always trying to get you, get you, get you,"" Trump said at his Sunday night coronavirus briefing in response to a question from a PBS News reporter about Trump's past comments to Fox News on New York's demands or ventilators. Trump flatly denied saying he didn't believe there was a need for 30,000 ventilators there, though he did, in fact, say he doubted those numbers for ""some areas."" Trump challenged the reporter to be more positive. ""And you know what? That's why nobody trusts the media anymore,"" Trump continued. All three major presidential campaigns -- Trump's, Biden's and that of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders -- continue their operations, with campaign staff working remotely, to some extent. Their social media accounts lob attacks at the other candidates. They're all soliciting online donations. And the Democratic candidates, who lack the everyday bully pulpit of the White House coronavirus task force briefings, have worked to hold digital campaign events in some form or another. But the election that was supposed to grab ahold of the news cycle after the conclusion of Trump's impeachment trial and not let go until November has been thoroughly upstaged by around-the-clock coverage of a global pandemic. The handshaking and selfie lines and retail politicking are no more. As are the live audiences at presidential debates whose applause or exasperated groans provide instant feedback as to who is winning -- the most recent Democratic presidential debate between Biden and Sanders happened in a sterile CNN studio in Washington, D.C. rather than a large auditorium. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP With the extension of the White House social distancing guidelines through April, it appears less and less likely there will be any Democratic presidential debate next month. Biden said last week that his ""focus is just dealing with this crisis right now. I haven’t thought about any more debates. I think we’ve had enough debates. I think we should get on with this."" The election is still happening. Eventually, there will be a Democratic presidential nominee. The parties will likely still hold their conventions in some form, although there is still a significant possibility that they will need to make major logistical changes if the coronavirus threat is still lingering over the summer. But, for now, with a potential death toll feared from the pandemic of just under five times the number of American soldiers killed in action during the Vietnam War, the presidential election has been relegated to the backburner.

Delta Air Lines and JetBlue have stepped up during the coronavirus pandemic by offering free flights for medical professionals to travel where they’re needed most amid the COVID-19 crisis. In recent days, both carriers have proposed the pitch to eligible medical professionals in the national fight against the viral disease. Delta is coordinating round-trip flights, free of charge, for qualified personnel to travel to Georgia, Louisiana and Michigan, while JetBlue is sending healthcare workers and desperately needed supplies to “places where they are needed most.” According to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the carrier is sending medical volunteers to the Empire State.       Both carriers have proposed the pitch to eligible medical professionals in the national fight against the viral disease.      (iStock) CORONAVIRUS CUTS: AIRLINES SLASH SNACKS, DRINKS AND MIDDLE SEATS DURING PANDEMIC In coordination with local and state governments, Delta is flying out eligible medical volunteers to Georgia, Louisiana and Michigan to help out in areas ""hardest hit"" by the virus. Looking ahead, the carrier will consider expanding the effort to other states that have been significantly impacted by the outbreak, like New York, California and Washington. “We are witnessing the heroic efforts of our medical professionals around the world as they combat COVID-19, and we have deep gratitude for their selfless sacrifice,” Bill Lentsch, Delta’s Chief Customer Experience Officer, announced on Friday. “Air travel plays a significant role in making connections in both good and challenging times, and our hope is that offering free travel gives more of these professionals the ability to help in critical areas of the U.S.” The flights will begin in April and can be reserved up to three days in advance, the Atlanta-based airline said.

"                          Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, member of the White House coronavirus task force, joins Chris Wallace on 'Fox News Sunday.' On the heels of the largest stimulus package passed in U.S. history, lawmakers on Capitol Hill and administration officials are contemplating yet another piece of legislation to provide economic relief amid the coronavirus outbreak. The latest indication came Monday, when Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he would be willing to ask Congress for more money for small businesses and those in the private workforce should it be necessary. MNUCHIN SAYS CORONAVIRUS RELIEF INSTRUCTIONS FOR SMALL BUSINESS SET TO BE RELEASED MONDAY A key piece of the $2.2 trillion relief bill passed last week is $350 billion in funding for small businesses. Businesses with fewer than 500 employees are eligible for up to $10 million in loans, which can be used for payroll and other expenses, like insurance premiums, mortgages, rent or utilities. “This is a very popular program with Republicans and Democrats, and the president likes it a lot,” Mnuchin told Fox Business’ Stuart Varney Monday. “If we run out of money, and this is a huge success, we will absolutely go back to Congress and ask for more money.” Congressional Republicans and Democrats also had signaled over the weekend that there could be a fourth coronavirus response bill. “I think the odds are we’ll need more legislation. First, we don’t know the extent of the crisis in terms of the magnitude, so that could rise. But there are going to be problems that we don’t realize now that we’re going to have to grapple with,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told The Hill. “So I think the odds are high there will be a COVID-4.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., also expressed the need for further legislation, telling CNN that Democrats “had bigger direct payments in our bill, and we think we’ll get more direct payments in another bill.” Democrats, in a fourth stimulus package, are reportedly seeking additional funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), also known as food stamps, as well as emissions restrictions on airlines — a measure that was blocked from inclusion in the package passed last week. Pelosi also said that she planned to push for pension protections. ""Pension protections — we had a protection in the legislation. It was supported by everyone,” Pelosi said on the House floor this weekend, noting it had support from President Trump but that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he would save it. “So that's why I'm mentioning it, for the next bill,"" Pelosi said. USUAL FISCAL HAWKS MUTED, MUZZLED AS CORONAVIRUS BILL POISED TO SWELL DEFICIT But House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., stressed that phase three of coronavirus legislation – the one approved last week – was “critical,” voicing uncertainty over whether another bill is necessary. “I’m not sure we need a fourth package,” McCarthy said on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures.” “And before we go to start drafting a fourth package, I’d like these three packages just put out…to take care and get this economy moving.” The 880-page coronavirus stimulus package amounted to the largest economic relief bill in the history of the U.S., with massive amounts of aid slated for individuals, large corporations and small businesses — and its unanimous passage in the Senate came despite concerns on both sides about whether it involved too much spending, or not enough. Democrats said the package specifically would help replace the salaries of furloughed workers for four months, rather than the three months first proposed. Furloughed workers would get whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment, plus a $600-per-week add-on. The package also gives $1,200 per adult and $500 per child directly to the public. But at the state level, governors have complained that the stimulus package didn’t do enough for them. “The congressional action in my opinion simply failed to address the governmental need,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said last week. “I’m disappointed, I said I was disappointed. I find it irresponsible, I find it reckless.” He added that the money New York does receive from the stimulus package was “earmarked only for COVID virus expenses, which means it does absolutely nothing for us in terms of lost revenue.” It is unclear exactly what could be included in a fourth response package and when provisions might be proposed, as both the House and Senate are on recess. As of Monday morning, the U.S. reported more than 143,500 positive cases of COVID-19 and more than 2,500 deaths.

Fox,         2020-03-07T154057-0500,https://foxnews.com/politics/pence-coronavirus-cruise-line-executives,         Pence calls for 'whole of America' approach to coronavirus at meeting with cruise line executives,"                          VP Pence meets with cruise line executives as 19 coronavirus deaths confirmed in the U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Saturday said the U.S. was engaging in a “whole of America” approach in response to the coronavirus, as he met with cruise line executives and port directors in Florida to discuss if any additional measures need to be taken. “President Trump has no higher priority than the health and safety and well-being of the American people,” Pence said, sitting alongside Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. “It’s the reason why, from the first advent of the coronavirus in America, the president launched a whole of government approach, but as evidenced here today it’s not just a whole of government approach... but it’s really a whole of America approach.” FLORIDA REPORTS 2 DEAD FROM CORONAVIRUS, FIRST KNOWN FATALITIES ON EAST COAST Pence said that the industry had found itself at the ""center"" of America's response to the crisis. He also said efforts were underway to bring the Grand Princess to shore, which has more than 3,500 passengers aboard and has been held off the California coast. Twenty-one people have tested positive for the virus on the ship, and Pence said Saturday that all passengers will be tested and those who have the virus will be quarantined. Pence said the administration has also met with the pharmaceutical industry, nursing home leaders, commercial laboratories and others in an effort to stem the spread of the global virus in America. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE “I speak for President Trump when I say we couldn't be more grateful with the spirit of cooperation from all the American businesses that we’ve engaged and their desire to put the health of America first,” he said. Pence’s remarks come as health officials reported that two people in Florida who tested positive for the virus have died -- making them the first known fatalities outside of California and Washington state. FLA SEN. RICK SCOTT: WE NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE CRUISE INDUSTRY The announcement raised the U.S. death toll from the coronavirus strain to at least 16, including 13 in the state of Washington and one in California, with at least 253 confirmed cases across the country. One of the Floridian deaths was a man with underlying health issues in Santa Rosa County in Florida's Panhandle and the other was an elderly person in Lee County, in the Fort Myers area. In his remarks, Pence highlighted the actions the Trump administration has taken, including declaring a public health emergency, suspending travel from China and now screening 100 percent of all of those who take direct flights from Italy and South Korea. He also praised the “yeoman’s work” by Health and Human Services in expanding testing for the virus. Trump signed an $8.3 billion spending bill this week, significantly higher than the $2.5 billion the administration had initially requested from Congress. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Pence also emphasized that for most Americans, the risk remains low -- noting that the risk is higher for the elderly who already have serious underlying health issues. “The risk of contracting the coronavirus for the average American remains low,” he said. “That being said, we are going to continue to lean into this effort, to call on industry, to call on every agency of government to deal with it.” Fox News’ Caleb Parke and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A memo regarding congressional operations and the coronavirus threat sent to all House offices by the House Administration Committee on Friday signals the House is seriously preparing for scenarios where staff may have to telework “in light of the unique and unusual circumstances presented by the coronavirus."" The memo obtained by Fox News indicates House offices may allocate unused funds to purchase telework equipment, such as computers and additional phones. On March 9, the House will set up a special center to prepare the infrastructure for telework scenarios. ""This will provide the opportunity for staff to receive technical assistance they may need to be prepared to work remotely,"" the memo states. ""Training will also be provided on how to remotely connect and access your office data and resources. ""All of these measures will help House offices improve their emergency preparedness in general and we urge offices to take advantage of the types of assistance highlighted below,"" the memo continued. The announcement comes as Washington lawmakers who attended the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's (AIPAC) annual policy conference were warned by the organization Wednesday that a group of attendees had potentially been in contact with a person from New York who had contracted coronavirus. More than 18,000 people from across the United States attended the conference, including Vice President Mike Pence, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Nearly two dozen Democrats also attended, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. In its email, AIPAC said no attendee of the conference has tested positive for the virus. A letter from the HAC to lawmakers said that the Office of Attending Physician at the Capitol has advised that being at the conference only constituted as an ""indirect exposure"" to coronavirus.

Fox,         2020-03-07T131303-0500,https://foxnews.com/politics/sanders-biden-enthusiasm-billionaire-backers,         Sanders says Biden can’t ‘generate enthusiasm’ due to billionaire backers,"                          Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders battle for the Democratic presidential nomination ahead of the Michigan primary; Fox News senior political correspondent Mike Emanuel reports. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on Saturday expressed doubt that Democratic presidential primary rival Joe Biden can “generate enthusiasm” due to the support he is getting from dozens of billionaires -- while promising to back the former vice president if he is the nominee. “The American people are disgusted with billionaires buying elections. We believe in democracy, one person one vote, not billionaires spending hundreds of millions of dollars ” Sanders told supporters in Dearborn, Mich. “I just don't think that Joe Biden can generate enthusiasm when you got 60 billionaires contributing to his campaign,” he said to boos. DEMOCRACY 2020 DIGEST: BIDEN PRESS SECRETARY SAYS SANDERS IS 'LYING' He went on to accuse Biden's backers of running “ugly” ads against him. The two men have trained their sights on each other after most other candidates have pulled out of the race -- with only Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, as the third remaining candidate. “When you've got, Joe Biden has a Super PAC with billionaires putting money into that Super PAC and right now our campaign has taken on a Super PAC running ugly negative ads against us all over the country,” Sanders said. After Biden scored major wins on Super Tuesday, restoring his status as frontrunner, Sanders has sought to draw a bigger distinction between them -- casting doubt on Biden’s ability to fight for the American people. “At the end of the day, people understand that if you're taking lots of money from billionaires, you’re not going to be there standing up for the working class and the middle class of this country,” he said. MODERATE DEMS BREATHE SIGH OF RELIEF AFTER SUPER TUESDAY BLUNTS SANDERS However, he also said he would support Biden if he got the nod from the Democratic Party, something that Biden has also said about Sanders. ""Because we know how important it is to beat President Trump,"" Sanders said. The remarks indicate the race for the nomination is intensifying. The self-described democratic socialist has targeted Biden since before Super Tuesday, but that has increased since Biden swept 10 of the 14 Super Tuesday states. This week, Sanders accused Biden of supporting banning openly gay Americans from serving in the military when he was in the Senate. Biden campaign national press secretary Jamal Brown responded by saying Sanders was “lying.” “[Biden] is on record saying he didn't have an issue with gays & lesbians in the military,” he said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP With 125 pledged delegates at stake, Michigan is the biggest prize among the six states holding primaries on Tuesday, March 10. Missouri, Mississippi, Washington State, Idaho and North Dakota also hold contests. Sanders told reporters on Thursday: ""Michigan is where we'll spend a bit of our time.""

Fox,         2020-03-04T012256-0500,https://foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-voter-analysis-biden-sanders-emerge-from-dem-pack-on-super-tuesday,         Fox News Voter Analysis Biden,"                          Former Vice President Joe Biden rallies supporters at a Super Tuesday event in Los Angeles, California. The Democratic primary took a dramatic turn on Super Tuesday, with Joe Biden winning at least eight states to continue his comeback story. At the same time, Bernie Sanders took home at least four states, including a win in delegate-rich California, to set up a showdown between the two in the primaries ahead. Maine and the key state of Texas remained extraordinarily close. Preliminary data from surveys in eight states conducted as part of the Fox News Voter Analysis sheds light on why the Super Tuesday results shook out the way they did – though these numbers may change slightly as more results come in.  Biden’s resounding win on Saturday in South Carolina gave him a much-needed boost and pushed fellow moderates Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg out of the race. Klobuchar, Buttigieg, and former presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke all endorsed Biden at an event in Dallas on Monday night, bolstering the sense of a campaign gathering steam.  BIDEN SURGES TO VICTORY ACROSS SUPER TUESDAY MAP, AS SANDERS CLAIMS DELEGATE PRIZE IN CALIFORNIA Late-deciding voters clearly bought into the idea that Biden was still in the game. More than a quarter of voters in each state said they made up their minds in the last few days – including more than half of those in Minnesota. Biden won late deciders by at least 15 points in every state but California, and by roughly 30 points or more in Virginia, Alabama, Minnesota, and North Carolina.  Sanders’ main sources of strength continue to be young and very liberal voters. He won better than four-in-10 voters under age 30 in each Super Tuesday state, topping out at 60 percent in a trio of states. Similarly, Sanders won at least four-in-10 of those who called themselves “very liberal” in each state.  By contrast, Biden’s base was seniors and, to a lesser degree, political moderates. He won at least four-in-10 voters over age 65 in every state except California, Colorado, and Massachusetts.  Among both seniors and moderates, Mike Bloomberg’s presence in the race appears to have complicated Biden’s path to victory. Roughly two-in-10 seniors in each state (except Minnesota and Massachusetts) backed the former mayor, and he picked up roughly 15 percent of the moderate vote or more in each state.  The Sanders campaign invested heavily in outreach to the Latino community, and it paid off in the states with the largest Hispanic populations. Biden narrowly edged Bloomberg as Latinos’ second choice.  Sanders’ strength among Latinos was balanced by Biden’s success with black voters. Biden won roughly half of the black vote (or better) in every state except for California (36 percent). Sanders’ best performance among black voters was 26 percent in North Carolina, followed by 24 percent in California.  Biden won white voters in Alabama, Virginia, and Minnesota; Sanders won whites in Colorado, and the two were deadlocked (or nearly so) in the remaining states.  Whites without a college degree went for Sanders by double-digit margins in Colorado and backed Biden by 11 percentage points in Alabama and 15 points in Virginia. The margins among this group in the other states were razor-thin.  The best groups for Bloomberg tended to overlap directly with sources of Biden’s strength: seniors, blacks, and political moderates. Biden’s late surge, however, effectively pushed Bloomberg off the map – the billionaire got less than two-in-10 late-deciding voters in each state.  Adding to Bloomberg’s difficult night was a failure to connect on his signature issues. Despite committing a considerable amount of his personal fortune to gun control and combating climate change, he won no more than two-in-10 voters who prioritized those issues in each state. Similarly, Bloomberg’s attempt to position himself as the candidate most likely to beat President Trump fell short – in each state, he got 20 percent or less among those who said beating President Trump was a very important quality for their nominee.  Most Super Tuesday voters – six-in-10 in most states, with a high of 73 percent in Minnesota – said it was important to them that a woman be elected president in their lifetime. Elizabeth Warren won 29 percent of these voters in Massachusetts, but still lost her adopted home state. In each other state, she won less than a quarter of those who wanted to see a female president in their lifetime.   Issues and policies As in the early primary states, more Super Tuesday voters wanted a candidate who would bring fundamental change to the political system than one who would restore it to the way it was before the Trump administration. That was particularly true in California and Colorado, two of the best states for Sanders.  At the same time, about six-in-10 voters wanted a candidate offering practical, centrist policies over one promising bold liberal ideas – even in more liberal states like California.   Biden won “restore” voters in each state, while Sanders won “change” voters everywhere except for Alabama (where they went for Biden). Similarly, voters wanting centrist policies opted for Biden in each state, and those seeking bold liberal ideas went for Sanders everywhere save Alabama (where, again, Biden won).  Despite divisions about the tone and tenor of their candidates’ approaches, Democrats were largely united in their opinions on key issues and policies. Health care topped voters’ issue list, with at least one-third in each state citing it as the most important issue facing the country. The economy and jobs was second in most of the Southern states (cited by roughly two-in-10 voters). Outside of the South, voters were more likely to mention climate change as their second-place concern (between 26 percent in California and 32 percent in Colorado).  On health care, more than eight-in-10 voters in each state favored a public option approach, while roughly two-thirds in each state backed a Sanders-style single payer plan.  Primary voters also broadly agreed on taxing the use of carbon-based fuels (support ranged between 62 percent in Alabama and 87 percent in Minnesota), marijuana legalization (72 percent in Virginia and Texas to 84 percent in Colorado), and reducing the criminal justice system’s focus on low-level offenses (78 percent in Alabama to 85 percent in Colorado). Fully nine-in-10 primary voters in Colorado and California favored limiting the amount of money presidential candidates and campaigns could spend, while support for the idea was slightly lower in Texas (85 percent) and Alabama (78 percent).  Democrats divided? Majorities of voters in each state would be satisfied if Biden, Sanders, or Warren were the eventual nominee. Overall satisfaction was slightly higher for Biden (ranging between 58 percent in Colorado and 81 percent in Alabama) than for Sanders (a low of 55 in Virginia and a high of 67 in California) or Warren (60 in Virginia to 71 in Colorado).  It was a different story for Bloomberg, as satisfaction ranged from a low of 39 (Colorado and Minnesota) to a high of 61 (Alabama). In five states, majorities would be dissatisfied if he captured the nomination. Across all states, nearly half of Biden and Bloomberg voters would be dissatisfied with Sanders as the nominee, while roughly six-in-ten Sanders supporters would be dissatisfied with Biden. Majorities of Warren voters would be satisfied with either Biden or Sanders as the nominee.  Sanders’ voters’ dissatisfaction could be amplified by concerns about the fairness of the nomination process. While roughly two-thirds of Super Tuesday voters overall had confidence in the process, a majority of Sanders voters felt the process was unfair.  Roughly three-quarters of voters (or more) in each state said they would definitely support the Democratic candidate in November against Trump, with Minnesota voters showing the most party solidarity (84 percent).  In several key swing states, however, two-in-ten voters said their decision in November would depend on who won the Democratic nomination. Warren voters were the most likely to say they would support the Democrat regardless of who won; Sanders and Bloomberg supporters were the least likely. Still, at least three-quarters of each candidate’s supporters said they would back the eventual nominee no matter what.  Texas and California The two largest prizes of the night – Texas and California – were a study in contrasts. Sanders was dominant throughout California, with Biden a distant second and both Bloomberg and Warren hovering around the 15 percent viability threshold for delegates. In Texas, on the other hand, Sanders and Biden were neck-and-neck, with Bloomberg lurking in third and Warren a distant fourth.  In California, Sanders led among most demographic groups, with the exception of moderates (with whom Biden led by 6 points), voters ages 45 and over (Biden +7 points) and black voters (Biden +12 points).  Sanders’ strongest groups in California – as they were across the country – were young voters, very liberal voters, and Latinos. He also won nearly four-in-ten voters without a college degree.  Biden’s strength with late-deciding voters helped him hold down Sanders’ delegate gains out of the Golden State.  Perhaps the most competitive – and consequential – battleground of the night was Texas, where Bloomberg played a major role. White voters split between the two leaders (27 percent for Biden and 25 for Sanders), while Bloomberg picked up 17 percent and Warren 13 percent. Sanders nearly doubled Biden’s support among Latinos, and Biden returned the favor by dominating among black Texans. Warren was unable to attract significant nonwhite support in the state.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Texans were much more likely to favor a public option approach to health care (87 percent) than single payer (63 percent) – and yet more felt Sanders would be best able to handle health care than Biden.  Methodology The Fox News Voter Analysis, conducted in partnership with The Associated Press, provides a comprehensive look at voting behavior, opinions and preferences as America votes. On Super Tuesday, surveys were conducted in Alabama, California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. The surveys were conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago the week before the primaries, concluding as polls closed. Interviews were conducted in English or Spanish. The survey is based on interviews with a random sample of registered voters drawn from the state voter file. In California, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Texas, and Virginia, these probability sample results were supplemented by interviews with self-identified registered voters recruited from nonprobability online panels. The sample sizes for the surveys ranged from 1,168 (Alabama) to 3,976 (California), with margins of sampling error ranging between plus or minus 4.9 and 3.0 percentage points.

Fox,         2020-02-28T172245-0500,https://foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-poll-trump-economy-failed-to-unify,         Fox News Poll Voters say Trump succeeded on economy,"                          Some Republicans are reportedly growing concerned about the virus' impact on the stock market and Americans' sense of security heading into the election; reaction and analysis on 'Outnumbered.' By a 20-point margin, voters say the Trump administration has mostly succeeded at stimulating the economy: 51 percent think that and 31 percent believe he has mostly failed. In addition, by a 19-point margin, more think the administration has mostly succeeded at creating jobs (50 percent succeeded, 31 percent failed). These are two of nine national priorities the latest Fox News Poll asks voters about.  The findings indicate success in some areas, while others need improvement -- including security. CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS The poll, released Friday, also finds more voters say they are better off than they were four years ago (35 percent) than worse off (24 percent).  The largest number, however, feels their situation is about the same (40 percent).  Nearly three times as many Republicans (58 percent) as Democrats (19 percent) say they are better off today. The president’s worst rating is on unifying the country: 59 percent say Trump has mostly failed (19 percent mostly succeeded).  Almost as many think he has mostly failed at improving race relations (55 percent), and many say the same about improving health care (50 percent failed). Voters are less than wowed with the job Trump has done on his “drain the swamp in Washington” promise -- 48 percent call that a failure (21 percent succeeded). Views are more mixed on security issues.  On making the country safer, voters say the administration has mostly failed by 7 points (38 succeeded, 45 failed). And despite the expansion of the U.S.-Mexico border wall, voters divide over whether Trump has been effective on his signature issue of border security (40 succeeded, 42 failed). On handling the Islamic extremist group ISIS, voters split:  39 percent mostly succeeded vs. 38 percent mostly failed. For comparison, voters believed the Obama administration had mostly failed on many of these same priorities as his term started to wind down. In January 2016, majorities gave failing grades for stimulating the economy (51 percent mostly failed), improving health care (53 percent), making the country safer (58 percent), improving race relations (59 percent), and handling ISIS (65 percent). In general, 47 percent of voters approve of Trump’s job performance and 52 percent disapprove.  That is a tad better than last month when it was 45-54 percent (January 2020).  The president’s best rating continues to be 48 percent approve vs. 47 percent disapprove in February 2017, soon after his inauguration.  His record low was 38 percent approval in October 2017. Fully 89 percent of Republicans are happy with Trump’s performance. And, his job approval stands at a record high of 14 percent among Democrats. Overall, a majority of voters approve of how Trump’s handling the economy (54 approve, 42 disapprove) -- yet a majority disapproves on health care (38 approve, 53 disapprove). Poll Pourri -- Most voters are at least somewhat confident the federal government is prepared to deal with the coronavirus (74 percent).  A smaller majority feels confident U.S. intelligence agencies are prepared to deal with the Russian government trying to interfere in the next presidential election (68 percent). -- On the Senate impeachment trial, voters approve of Trump’s acquittal (50-44 percent). -- Views split on Trump’s recent presidential pardons.  Forty-nine percent think they were an abuse of pardon power, while 43 percent call them “fairly typical.”  In February 2001, 55 percent said pardons by former President Clinton were an abuse of power and 32 percent said typical. -- Voters remain unhappy with lawmakers in Washington:  26 percent approve of the job Congress is doing and 65 percent disapprove. -- Nearly half of voters, 49 percent, disapprove of Trump’s tweeting.  That’s more than double the 19 percent who approve.  Another 28 percent “wish he’d be more cautious.” Conducted February 23-26, 2020 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,000 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones.  The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points for all registered voters.

Fox,         2020-02-28T170723-0500,https://foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-poll-capitalism-socialism-bernie-sanders,         Fox News Poll Three in 10 voters view socialism positively,"                          Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Capitalism beats socialism by a two-to-one margin in the latest Fox News Poll. By a 26-point spread, voters have a more positive than negative view of capitalism (56 favorable - 30 unfavorable). The opposite holds true for socialism, where sentiment is net negative by 30 points (28 favorable - 58 unfavorable). CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS That’s almost exactly where things stood a year ago, despite the popularity of Sen. Bernie Sanders', I-Vt., presidential campaign. The Democratic presidential frontrunner says “billionaires should not exist,” yet 76 percent of voters overall and 67 percent of Democrats think it’s a good thing people can become billionaires in the United States. For many though, there are limits.  Voters agree by a 56-35 percent margin the government “should increase taxes on the wealthiest individuals so that nobody gets to be too rich.”  A decade ago, it was the reverse: 40 percent favored increased taxes and 55 percent disagreed. Billionaires, generically, garner somewhat negative ratings in the poll (35 favorable - 44 unfavorable).  Mere millionaires are a bit more popular (41 favorable - 39 unfavorable).  One in five voters is unable to give an opinion of either millionaires or billionaires. Views among groups Twice as many Democrats (40 percent) as Republicans (15 percent) feel positively about socialism. Republicans (67 percent) are more likely than Democrats (50 percent) to have a favorable view of capitalism. Men are 26 points more likely than women to have a favorable view of capitalism (70 vs. 44 percent).  That gender gap disappears on socialism, as roughly equal numbers of men (29 percent) and women (27 percent) feel positively. Voters ages 65 and over are far more likely than those under age 35 to like capitalism (72 vs. 44 percent), and young voters are more than twice as likely as seniors to have a favorable view of socialism (35 vs. 16 percent). CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Democratic primary voters who back Sanders in the nomination race have a net positive view of socialism by 17 points (49 favorable - 32 unfavorable), and a net negative view of capitalism (by 15 points) and billionaires (by 59 points).  Some 74 percent of Sanders’ supporters have an unfavorable opinion of billionaires. Conducted February 23-26, 2020 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,000 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones.  The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points for all registered voters.

Bernie Sanders' promises of 'free' college and health care, a new study shows only 16 percent of millennials are 'financially literate.' Bernie Sanders pushes Joe Biden out of the frontrunner spot for the Democratic nomination, capturing a record 31 percent support among primary voters in a new Fox News Poll. This is the first 2020 Fox national poll that finds Biden not leading the Democratic race. The survey also finds a marked increase in the number of voters who think President Trump will win the election. Sanders has gained 8 percentage points since January in the nomination race, while Biden drops into second with 18 percent, down 8 points. Close behind is Mike Bloomberg at 16 percent, up 6 points since last month and triple his 5 percent in December. Pete Buttigieg comes in at 12 percent (up 5), Elizabeth Warren at 10 percent (down 4), and Amy Klobuchar at 5 percent (up 2). This is the first Fox News poll with five candidates in double digits. It was conducted Sunday through Wednesday. Sanders, notably, was the most attacked candidate during Tuesday’s contentious presidential debate in South Carolina. Sanders performs well with groups across the board, with an extra boost from young voters, self-described liberals, whites without a college degree, and those looking for change. Biden is strongest among women over age 45, voters who regularly attend religious services, and those who long for a return to the pre-Trump era. CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS The nomination race looks almost the same when narrowed to Democratic primary voters in the 14 Super Tuesday states: Sanders remains on top with 30 percent, followed by Bloomberg at 18 percent, Biden 17 percent, Warren 11 percent, and Buttigieg and Klobuchar each get 8 percent. Overall, majorities of primary voters think Sanders (65 percent), Bloomberg (57 percent) and Biden (56 percent) can beat Donald Trump. Since December, the number believing Sanders can win is up 5 points (was 60 percent). But Democratic voters’ faith in most of the other candidates is shaken since December. The portion saying Biden can win is down 21 points (from 77 percent), while Warren (-22 points) and Buttigieg (-12) also saw declines. Democrats remain divided on central questions facing their party. By a 10-point margin, more want a nominee who will fundamentally change how the political system works (52 percent) than want someone who will restore the system to pre-Trump administration (42 percent). There is a similar divide over whether they prefer a nominee who is a pragmatist or a visionary: by a 9-point margin, more are looking for a candidate who will pursue “practical centrist” policies (49 percent) than want someone who will pursue “bold liberal” plans (40 percent). Sanders leads by more than 30 points among “bold liberal” voters, while support among “practical centrist” voters splinters: Biden (21 percent), Bloomberg (20 percent), Sanders (19 percent) and Buttigieg (15 percent). Those wanting change prefer Sanders by more than 20 percentage points. Biden is the favorite for those wanting to hit reset, although he leads by a narrower 9-point margin. It’s important not to overstate these differences, as Sanders is the second choice among restore voters and Bloomberg comes in second among change voters. More primary voters think Biden’s policies are realistic (67 percent), than say the same about Bloomberg (57 percent realistic), Buttigieg (55 percent), Sanders (53 percent), Warren (49 percent), and Klobuchar (44 percent). When asked if there is a candidate primary voters could not support, Bloomberg and Sanders (18 percent each) have the largest number saying they would refuse to vote for them in November, followed by Biden and Warren (13 percent apiece) and Tulsi Gabbard (10 percent). Forty-five percent of Democratic primary voters say they would vote for any one of the current candidates over Trump. There is no hurry to narrow the field. Fifty-four percent of primary voters want candidates to stay in the race even if they failed to finish in the top three in any of the early contests. What’s more, by a 50-38 percent margin, they say the Democratic Party should have the flexibility to nominate someone else if no candidate has a majority of delegates at the convention. Sanders, as the candidate currently best positioned to win the most delegates, thinks the candidate with the delegate lead should win the nomination, even if it isn’t a majority. The other top candidates support flexibility if no candidate has a majority. In general, 75 percent of all Democratic primary voters and 67 percent of Sanders supporters feel confident the Democratic Party’s process of picking a nominee is fair. 2020 general election Among all voters, all six Democratic candidates tested top the president in trial ballots. Trump trails Biden and Bloomberg by 8 points and Sanders by 7. Those are the only leads outside the poll’s margin of error.  Warren (+3 points), Buttigieg (+3) and Klobuchar (+1) are barely ahead. And in each instance, there are enough undecided/third-party voters to move the race either way. Forty-two percent would vote to re-elect Trump if the election were today. That’s up from 38 percent in May 2019 and the largest share he’s received to-date. On the other side, a majority of 52 percent would vote for someone else. That puts the president underwater by 10 points, an improvement from a net negative of 16 points in May 2019. At the extremes: 32 percent would definitely vote for Trump vs. 45 would definitely back someone else. Despite those findings, 56 percent think Trump will be re-elected. That’s up from 44 percent in October.  Expectations increased among Republicans (+9 points) and Democrats (+16). Eight years ago, 52 percent thought former President Obama would be re-elected. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Poll Pourri Biden (50 percent) and Sanders (49 percent) have the highest favorable ratings -- and have more who view them positively than negatively. Biden’s net favorability rating is best (+4 points), followed by Sanders (+2), and Buttigieg (+1). Klobuchar is net neutral, and the ratings for Warren (-4), Steyer (-7), Bloomberg (-8), and Trump (-11) are underwater. Voters favor giving everyone the option to buy into Medicare by a 67-23 percent margin and making minor changes to Obamacare by 58-32 percent. A 49-percent plurality opposes getting rid of private insurance and moving to a government-run health care system (42 percent favor). Among Democratic primary voters, 76 percent favor the public option (Buttigieg’s position), 74 percent favor mostly keeping Obamacare (Biden), and 56 percent favor a government-run plan (Sanders and Warren). The poll, released Thursday, asks Democratic primary voters if any candidates may not be physically healthy enough to carry out the job of president. Sanders is the most frequently mentioned at 30 percent, followed by Biden at 16 percent. Nearly one in five Sanders supporters thinks he may lack what it takes to do the job physically. Among all voters, 63 percent think presidential candidates should be required to release their full medical records, and 70 percent say the same about tax returns. When it comes to Democratic primary voters, there is an even larger desire for full disclosure: 72 percent want to see full medical records and 90 percent want to see tax returns. Conducted February 23-26, 2020 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,000 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points for all registered voters and 4 points for Democratic primary voters (507).    "
Fox,         2020-03-07T091229-0500,https://foxnews.com/politics/ocasio-cortez-illegal-immigrants-2020-census,         Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calls on illegal immigrants to fill out 2020 census,"                          Fox News has confirmed the departure of Corbin Trent from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's re-election campaign. He was the campaign’s spokesman and former leader at Justice Democrats. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is coming under fire after urging illegal immigrants to participate in the upcoming census -- with opponents saying her language was “anti-American,” ""We're all going to get mailed a prompt to fill out the census in the next two weeks or so,"" she said Thursday on “Late Night with Seth Meyers.” ""And so I think what’s really important is that we all fill this out. It happens once every 10 years.” FACEBOOK DROPS TRUMP ADS AFTER PELOSI CITES CENSUS CONFUSION “Every single person, no matter your documentation status, no matter your housing status, income, etc., is to be counted,” she said, before assuring viewers that the data included is “completely confidential” and not shared with other agencies. “So don’t worry if you’re having a creative living situation, it’s not going to be told to your landlord or anything crazy like that,” she added. The census is a once-a-decade population count that determines how $1.5 trillion in federal spending is allocated, and also how many congressional seats each state gets. The Census Bureau notes that it counts “our population and households” in the U.S. The remarks come after she shared a video, distributed by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's office, and emphasized that ""you will NOT be asked about immigration status."" Ocasio-Cortez’s remarks angered at least one New York lawmaker -- who said her rhetoric was “anti-American.” “Illegal aliens should not be counted equally to law-abiding Americans and legal immigrants – plain and simple,” Assemblyman Mike LiPetri said in a statement.  “When radical left-wing politicians like AOC make such statements, she sends a message to all Americans and legal immigrants that it doesn’t matter if you work hard and play by the rules, we’re going to prioritize criminals and those here illegally over you.” AOC CLAIMS BIDEN 'OVERPERFORMED' SUPER TUESDAY BECAUSE HIS CAMPAIGN FACED 'LOW EXPECTATIONS'  Ocasio-Cortez’s push for those in the country illegally to fill out the census is part of a broader fight over the census, which saw the Trump administration try to include a question on citizenship in the census. That move was scrapped after the Supreme Court ruled against the administration, with Democrats claiming that even asking the question could spook illegal immigrants from filling out the entire census. The question however, did not ask whether a non-citizen was here illegally or not, just whether they were a citizen. A number of Democratic states and localities, including New York and California, are estimated to have large numbers of illegal immigrants and the amount of funding they receive -- something determined by the census -- rests in part of how many of them they can get to fill out the form. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump in July last year accused Democrats of trying to “conceal the number of illegal aliens in our midst.” This is part of a broader left-wing effort to erode the rights of the American citizen,” he said. “And it’s very unfair to our country.”    "

Tulsi Gabbard addresses preparations that need to be made to protect the U.S. from a coronavirus outbreak. The only woman remaining in the 2020 race for the White House is calling on her party's top two competitors to help pressure the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to allow her to participate in an upcoming presidential debate in Phoenix. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, is now one of only three Democratic candidates still running for president. On Super Tuesday, March 3, she walked away with two delegates from American Samoa, which would have helped her qualify in the previous debate, held Feb. 25 in Charleston, S.C. However, the DNC released a new requirement for the March 15 Phoenix debate. Participants for that contest must have at least 20 percent of the pledged delegates, which means only the two leaders -- former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. -- qualify. 'THE VIEW' LAUGHS OFF TULSI GABBARD AFTER SHE WON DELEGATE ON SUPER TUESDAY: 'PUT A FORK IN IT!' On Friday night, Gabbard took to social media and appealed to Biden and Sanders to let her join them on the debate stage once again. ""@JoeBiden @Bernie Sanders I’m sure you would agree that our Democratic nominee should be a person who will stand up for what is right. So I ask that you have the courage to do that now in the face of the DNC's effort to keep me from participating in the debates,"" Gabbard tweeted. She then called out the DNC for changing the debate requirements to allow Mike Bloomberg onto the debate stage. ""To keep me off the stage, the DNC again arbitrarily changed the debate qualifications. Previously they changed the qualifications in the OPPOSITE direction so Bloomberg could debate. I ask that you stand w/ me against the DNC’s transparent effort to exclude me from the debates. #LetTulsiDebate,"" she said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The hashtag #LetTulsiDebate trended on Twitter throughout Friday evening. Gabbard has not appeared on at a Democratic debate since November. She was also snubbed by CNN's town hall series despite the liberal network inviting former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, whose polling was lower than hers.    "

Elizabeth Warren expresses disappointment that little girls will have to wait four more years for the chance of a female president; reaction and analysis on 'Outnumbered.' Now that Elizabeth Warren has bowed to the inevitable, the Biden-Bernie matchup is either a battle for the soul of the Democratic Party…or the typical dust-settling of a conventional race. That is, one establishment candidate, a veteran, battle-scarred establishment type who is not terribly exciting, and an insurgent candidate, a colorful, more ideological provocateur who makes followers swoon. In this view, the voters who gave Joe Biden 10 Super Tuesday victories were simply coming home after flirting with two dozen potential dates. Biden was the safe, dependable choice for those whose main goal is beating President Trump—and that includes some who feel more affinity with Bernie Sanders. Usually, this plays out over a couple of months, and the race is hardly over. But in the space of four days, Biden transformed his fortunes and, in what had seemed unthinkable, passed Sanders in the delegate count. It didn’t hurt that Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg closed ranks behind him, followed by Mike Bloomberg, or that he was lifted aloft by his first sustained burst of positive press. But the breadth of his coalition—African-Americans, working classes, suburban dwellers and older voters—suggests he was always a likely front-runner once folks were convinced he could win. BLOOMBERG INVESTMENT BOMBS AS PRESS BELATEDLY BOOSTS BIDEN It was, as John Harris puts it in Politico, “a signal that not all the old ways of thinking about national politics are defunct in an age of disruption.” The 2008 contest was the exception, with newcomer Obama toppling semi-incumbent Hillary. But Harris recites the history: “Jimmy Carter in 1980, Walter Mondale in 1984, Bill Clinton in 1992, John Kerry in 2004, Hillary Clinton in 2016—the party has ultimately coalesced over the more consensus-oriented politician in the spring after a flirtation with more flamboyant or purely ideological insurgents.” And that means Gary Hart, Paul Tsongas, Howard Dean, Bill Bradley—and Bernie last time—didn’t win. The very factors that made Biden seem like a plodding war horse—nearly four decades in the Senate, eight as vice president, lots of political baggage—were why a majority of Democrats have so far decided that he’d be a reassuring choice as commander-in-chief. And that brings us to why the race is now down to a 77-year-old Democrat, a 78-year-old independent and a 73-year-old president. When Warren emerged from her Cambridge home and made some humble withdrawal comments, MSNBC reporter Ali Vitali asked: “I wonder what your message would be to the women and girls who feel like we’re left with two old white men to decide between?” (We’re left with.) SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES Warren replied that “one of the hardest parts of this is all those pinky promises and all those little girls who are going to have to wait four more years. That’s going to be hard.” The problem with this question is that Warren was riding a wave of favorable press and voter support when she was leading the polls last fall. Then she started making mistakes, from embracing and then fudging on Medicare for All to migrating from an unabashed progressive to a “unity” candidate. Of course there is sexism in the press and in society. But that didn’t stop Hillary from winning the nomination and the popular vote. Warren, Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand didn’t drop out because America is wedded to male septuagenarians; they just failed to get sufficient traction. Here’s a different view of the former Harvard law professor from Megan Garber in the Atlantic: “Warren had something about her, apparently: something that galled the pundits and the public in a way that led to assessments of her not just as ‘strident’ and ‘shrill,’ but also as ‘condescending.’ The matter is not merely that the candidate is unlikable, these deployments of condescending imply. The matter is instead that her unlikability has a specific source, beyond bias and internalized misogyny.  “Warren knows a lot, and has accomplished a lot, and is extremely competent, condescending acknowledges, before twisting the knife: It is precisely because of those achievements that she represents a threat. Condescending attempts to rationalize an irrational prejudice…When I hear her talk, I want to slap her, even when I agree with her.” Running for president is brutal; only one person prevails in each party. Everyone’s personality is mocked; Joe Biden is routinely portrayed as a rambling, forgetful geezer. In “SNL” terms, Kate McKinnon is Warren the know-it-all; Larry David is Bernie the ranting relative; Alec Baldwin is Trump the know-nothing. Maybe it comes down to the fact that this was the first presidential campaign for Warren, who got into politics less than a decade ago, but the second for Sanders and the third for Biden. The former veep will need that experience, if he’s the nominee, going up against another political newcomer who has come to dominate American politics.    "
Fox,         2020-03-04T144933-0500,https://foxnews.com/media/bloomberg-investment-bombs-as-press-belatedly-boosts-biden,         Bloomberg investment bombs as press belatedly boosts Biden,"                           Mike Bloomberg didn’t need one of his fancy Wall Street terminals to interpret the data that he got shellacked on Super Tuesday. And faster than anyone might have imagined, he got out of the race and backed Joe Biden. Bloomberg’s return on his $500-million investment: not much, though he’ll always have American Samoa. It was a stark reminder that money—even massive amounts of money on a scale never before seen in American politics—can’t buy a nomination. And an equally dramatic reminder that the press makes the same mistake every four years, conflating big bucks with political strength. Bloomberg, who never recovered from that Vegas debate debacle, was smart to call it quits, and his considerable fortune will certainly help Biden, especially if the former VP prevails against Bernie Sanders and has to battle the Trump machine. BIDEN SHOCKS THE PUNDITS, AGAIN, WITH SURPRISINGLY STRONG SUPER TUESDAY Politicians and the press always overstate the importance of money and organization. They matter, but not as much as the candidate and the message. That mistake has been made again and again, with candidates ranging from Phil Gramm to Jeb Bush to, well, Donald Trump, who was massively outspent in 2016. And how many pieces did I have to read about Elizabeth Warren’s awesome field operation? That didn’t stop her from being clobbered again and again, even finishing third in her home state of Massachusetts. When the press was portraying Biden as having one foot in the political grave, Bloomberg became the new savior—especially for many in the party who feared a Bernie nomination would be disastrous. And it’s true that as he blitzed the airwaves, he moved up in the polls. But Bloomberg was damaged by reports of things he’d done and said as a Republican, especially stop and frisk, and was less than impressive when he finally came out from behind the curtain to do a couple of interviews. In the end, the money didn’t matter. Voters deserted him en masse as soon as Biden seemed viable again. In a way, the former vice president ought to thank the press for performing last rites on his struggling campaign. It made his victories in Virginia, Massachusetts, Maine, North Carolina, Alabama, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Minnesota and Texas seem absolutely miraculous. The way in which so much of the press had declared Biden finished, kaput, washed up after Iowa and New Hampshire was nothing short of journalistic malpractice. “Drop out, Joe Biden. New Hampshire proves you are done,” said a Business Insider headline. SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES Everyone knew those two small, largely white states were rough terrain for Biden, and yet it didn’t matter. Even after his blowout win in South Carolina, many journalists said he couldn’t possibly be competitive in 14 states because he didn’t have the money and organization (there are those words again). It didn’t matter. A strong ground game is great when a candidate is connecting. But the dogs have to like the dog food. The two-day interval between South Carolina and Super Tuesday turned out to be perfect for Biden. Peaking at the right time is political gold. Another week would have given him more time to raise money, but also more time for Sanders to sharpen his attacks and for unexpected events to intervene. The candidate, of course, deserves substantial credit. Biden got better as he grew in confidence. He was often photographed, by design, interacting with average votes, not a Sanders or Bloomberg specialty. His two victory speeches were tightly scripted rather than an attempt to thank everyone in the room. But the press should be careful about this latest swing of the pendulum. Biden is the same guy who not long ago was being derided for stupid gaffes, shaky debate performances and meandering speeches. Sanders still has a passionate following and substantial number of delegates. The same journalists who said Biden couldn’t win shouldn’t fall into the trap of now saying he can’t lose.    "

Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com. Hillary Clinton may not have yet given her endorsement for her party’s presidential nomination this year, but that doesn’t mean she’s not weighing in on who she thinks will be the best – or the worst - candidate to go up against President Trump this fall.  Clinton, who lost the 2016 general election to Trump, said of  Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders: ""I do not think he's our strongest nominee against Donald Trump.” But she stopped short of throwing her endorsement behind former Vice President Joe Biden. Speaking on CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS,” Clinton – who faced a surprisingly tough nomination in 2016 from Sanders – has been highly critical of the Vermont lawmaker throughout the 2020 election season, but this is the former secretary of state’s first comments since the race to take on Trump basically became a two-man contest following Super Tuesday.  HILLARY CLINTON UNLEASHES ON BERNIE SANDERS IN NEW DOCUMENTARY: 'NOBODY LIKES HIM' While Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, has yet to exit the race, the Democratic nomination is now firmly a battle between Sanders and Biden. Clinton’s slam on Sanders comes just days after she called his campaign and platform “baloney” and ripped his claims that he is taking on Washington elites. ""He was a career politician,” she said during an interview on ABC's ""Good Morning America.""  “It's all just baloney and I feel so bad that people got sucked into it.” In regards to Biden, Clinton did not come out with an outright endorsement of the former vice president, but praised the “coalition” he is building and the momentum he has generated since his wins on Super Tuesday. “I think what Joe’s victories on Super Tuesday showed is that he is building the kind of coalition that I had basically,” Clinton said. “It’s a broad-based coalition. I finished, you know, most of the work I needed to do for the nomination on Super Tuesday, and then it kind of lingered on — and I think Joe is on track to doing exactly the same thing — putting together a coalition of voters who are energized.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Clinton, who last month said she would support Sanders should he win the Democratic nomination, told CNN that she hopes Sanders and his backers would go in for Biden should the former vice president secure the Democratic nomination. “I hope so because his failure and the behavior of a lot of his top aides, and certainly many of his supporters — up to the convention, at the convention, and even up to Election Day was not helpful,” she said, recalling Sanders’ actions during the 2016 election. She added: “I had thought we would unify, that's what we'd always done before and that's what I expected. I certainly tried to do that when I ran against Barack Obama and worked very hard for him.”    "

Hunter Biden should be held in contempt for continuing to defy a court order to turn over his financial information, flaunting his lack of ""respect"" for the legal process and undermining the interests of the child he has previously refused to support or even acknowledge, according to a blistering new filing from the mother of Biden's child in an ongoing paternity case. The motion comes as Joe Biden has surged to front-runner status in the Democrats' presidential primary amid new questions over whether his son may have corruptly benefited from his father's position as vice president. The case threatens to surface new information about the younger Biden's overseas dealings in Ukraine, China and elsewhere during the Obama administration -- and his father's apparent knowledge of those arrangements. ""After months of hiding, one has to wonder if the reason Hunter Biden continues to defy the court is because there are financial documents that could shed light on his father’s massive conflicts of interest as vice president,"" Republican National Committee (RNC) spokesman Steve Guest told Fox News on Sunday. The filing from 28-year-old Lunden Alexis Roberts' legal team wastes little time in charging that Hunter Biden ""continues to act as though he has no respect for this Court, its orders, the legal process in this state, or the needs of his child for support."" It argues that the court ""should take some action that will make the defendant follow court orders and a believer in the rule of law."" Specifically, Biden has not turned over information concerning his address, financial institutions he or his businesses use, a list of all the companies he ""currently owns or in which he has an ownership interest and the state in which those companies are incorporated,"" or a list of ""all sources of income for the past five years."" HUNTER BIDEN'S SCANDALS EXPLAINED: UKRAINE, COCAINE, AND MORE       U.S. Vice President Joe Biden (L) waves as he walks out of Air Force Two with his granddaughter Finnegan Biden and son Hunter Biden at the airport in Beijing December 4, 2013. The younger Biden's business dealings are coming under scrutiny as House Democrats push forward with an impeachment inquiry into President Trump for allegedly pressuring the Ukranian President to investigate the Biden family for political gain.      (Reuters) Additionally, Biden has failed to produce a list of all ""employers for the past five years,"" an unredacted copy of his tax returns, deeds for properties he owns, and tax documents for companies in which he has any ownership interest. The previous judge in the case, Don McSpadden, said in December that Biden was ""going to have to provide at least the last three years of tax returns."" A Dec. 4 court order required Biden to turn over at a minimum ""five most recent paystubs or five previous years"" of tax returns; and a later order mandated both sides provide ""their personal tax returns for the past five years; and ... any and all financial documents and information showing money or monies they received in the past five years."" Independence County Circuit Court Judge Holly Meyer, who now oversees the case, has said those orders are still in effect. Biden's conduct is ""willful and contemptuous,"" according to Roberts' lawyers, and he should be ordered to appear in person at a March 13 hearing to explain why he should not be held in contempt. WHOOPS: BIDEN CAMPAIGN TOUTS UKRAINE ACTIVIST WHO CALLED HUNTER'S ACTIONS 'VERY BAD' Meyer had previously ordered Biden to appear in person for the same reason, but Biden temporarily avoided being held in contempt when he agreed to pay an undisclosed monthly child support amount. At the time, Meyer noted she ""lacks sufficient information"" about Biden's finances to determine the appropriate child support totals, and delayed contempt proceedings until March 1. Those proceedings now appeared likely to resume this week. The younger Biden is also slated to appear at a deposition on March 11, despite his efforts to quash the deposition and obtain a protective order (“He needs to make himself available unless his hair is on fire,” Meyer said during a conference call with the attorneys on the case last month, according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.) ""After months of hiding, one has to wonder if the reason Hunter Biden continues to defy the court is because there are financial documents that could shed light on his father’s massive conflicts of interest as vice president."" The New York Times reported last week that the 50-year-old Hunter Biden is spending his time attempting to pass himself off as a painter in a rented $12,000-per-month hideout in Hollywood Hills while driving a Porsche. The paternity case established that Hunter Biden was the father of Roberts' baby after a DNA test. Roberts had argued that Biden was essentially an absent father, and the younger Biden had repeatedly denied paternity until the DNA test. Republicans, and even some left-of-center commentators and career State Department employees, have said Biden appeared to be trading on his access to his father as part of a career of illicit dealings -- raising the prospect that the financial documents could shed additional light on their accusations. Top Republican senators recently requested travel records from the Secret Service that might shed light on Hunter Biden's dealings in China, which President Trump has long said merit a state investigation. The paternity dispute has presented headaches for the elder Biden ever since a court filing showed that DNA results indicated he was now a grandfather. Joe Biden tangled with a Fox News reporter on camera when asked about that development last November. ""I'm wondering if you have a comment on this report, and court filing, out of Arkansas, that your son Hunter just made you a grandfather again,"" Fox News’ Peter Doocy asked. ""No, that’s a private matter and I have no comment,"" Biden fired back before attacking the reporter. ""Only you would ask that,"" Biden said. ""You're a good man. You're a good man. Classy."" TENSIONS FLARE IN CONGRESS, AS GOP REP BRINGS UP HUNTER BIDEN'S COCAINE USE Campaigning late last year, Biden has also lashed out at voters -- even appearing to call one man ""fat"" for bringing up issues with his son's possible corruption and questioning his fitness for office. “You’re a damn liar, man,"" Biden said. “Let’s do push-ups together here, man. Let’s run. Let’s do whatever you want to do. Let’s take an IQ test. ... No one has said my son has done anything wrong.""    "

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Sunday that while he hopes it doesn’t come to it, the government could shut down certain sections of the country hit hard by the coronavirus. Speaking during an interview on “Fox News Sunday,” Fauci said that “anything is possible” when asked if measures like those currently being imposed in Italy could be enacted in the U.S. to help prevent the continued spread of the coronavirus.  “I don’t think it would be as draconian as nobody in or nobody out,” Fauci said. “But if we continue to get cases like this, particularly at the community level, there will be what we call 'mitigation,' where we have to essentially do social distancing, keep people out of crowded places, take a look at seriousness, do you really need to travel, and I think it’s particularly important among the most vulnerable.” He added: “You know, you don’t want to alarm people, but given the spread we’ve seen, you know, anything’s possible. And that’s the reason why we’ve got to be prepared to take whatever action is appropriate to contain and mitigate the outbreak.” CORONAVIRUS: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW Fauci’s comments shortly after Italian Minister Giuseppe Conte signed a decree restricting the movements of about a quarter of the country's population in a bid to limit contagions at the epicenter of Europe's outbreak. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo joins 'Sunday Morning Futures' to discuss the growing number of coronavirus cases in his state. “For Lombardy and for the other northern provinces that I have listed there will be a ban for everybody to move in and out of these territories and also within the same territory,"" Conte said. ""Exceptions will be allowed only for proven professional needs, exceptional cases and health issues.” Around the world, more and more countries were bracing for a big increase in virus cases. Western countries have been increasingly imitating China – where the virus first emerged late last year, and which has suffered the vast majority of infections — by imposing travel controls and shutting down public events. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Fauci also cautioned people most at risk of dying from the coronavirus or complications relating to it – the elderly and people with preexisting conditions – to keep their distance from places where they could contract the virus, and to avoid any unnecessary travel. “If you are an individual that has an underlying condition, particularly an elderly person with an underlying condition, right now you should start to distance yourself from the risk: crowds, getting on a plane, on a long plane trip, and above all, don’t get on a cruise ship,” he said. “That is a health issue.”  In waters around the world, the virus outbreak has left the cruise ship industry largely in disarray.  The Grand Princess cruise ship, where 21 people have tested positive for the virus, was heading Sunday to Oakland, Calif., after idling off San Francisco for days. It is expected to arrive Monday. Americans on the ship will be transferred to facilities around the country for testing and isolation, officials have said, but it's not yet clear what will happen to passengers from other countries. The ship had a cluster of almost 20 infections during an earlier voyage, which led to one death.  Another cruise ship has been in quarantine on the Nile River in Egypt with 45 confirmed virus cases. Malaysia and Malta turned away two other ships with no confirmed cases amid virus fears. While the global death toll has risen past 3,400, more people have now recovered from the virus than are sickened by it. As of Saturday, nearly 90,000 cases have been reported in Asia; more than 8,000 in Europe; 6,000 in the Mideast; about 450 in North America, Latin America and the Caribbean, and fewer than 50 cases reported so far in Africa. While many scientists say the world is clearly in the grips of a pandemic — a serious global outbreak – the World Health Organization isn’t calling it that yet, saying the word might spook the world further. The virus is still much less widespread than annual flu epidemics, which cause up to 5 million severe cases around the world and up to 650,000 deaths annually, according to the WHO. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is urging older adults and people with severe medical conditions to ""stay home as much as possible"" and avoid crowds. Most people who get the virus have mild cases, though the elderly face greater risks.

Doug Collins says the administration remains on top of the coronavirus outbreak and weighs in on the House's fight to prevent future FISA abuses. President Trump took to Twitter early Monday to call out Governor Andrew Cuomo over an interview where the  New York Democrat blamed the administration of being unclear in its response to the coronavirus and therefore contributing to the confusion at the state level. STEVE HILTON: STOP THIS RECKLESS REACTION Trump accused Cuomo of using the virus to score political points after the governor told MSNBC that the federal government has been sending mixed messages. He used the availability of test kits as an example and said if the public doesn't have faith in the federal government, then  ""there’s really a problem."" OIL PRICES FALL 25 PERCENT Trump retweeted a link to the interview and said, ""There are no mixed messages, only political weaponization by people like you and your brother, Fredo."" Cuomo’s brother, Chris Cuomo, has a primetime show on CNN. Trump appointed Vice President Mike Pence on Feb. 26 to lead the coronavirus response. To date, there are at least 21 U.S. deaths and more than 500 infections scattered over more than 30 states as the federal government struggles to meet demand for diagnostic testing kits. Raul Perea-Henze, New York City's deputy mayor for health, wrote a letter to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention saying that the city is in dire need of more test kits. The Wall Street Journal reported that health officials in Washinton State have expressed similar concerns about these kits. Some experts said they’ve been hoping for clearer and louder guidance from the government, to prod vulnerable people to take every possible step to avoid settings where they might more easily become infected. GET THE FOX NEWS APP Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of tropical medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, last week warned U.S. lawmakers against minimizing the viruses risk for vulnerable people. During a Congressional hearing, he said the coronavirus ""is like the angle of death for older individuals."" Cuomo declared a state of emergency to bolster the medical response to the outbreak, as the statewide total doubled from the 44 cases heading into the weekend to 89. Trump signed an $8.3 billion spending bill last week aimed at fighting the coronavirus outbreak, the culmination of a bipartisan effort by Congress and the White House to provide funds to federal agencies, as well as state and local governments, to battle the disease.

Dan Scavino, the director of social media at the White House, took to Twitter early Monday to deny the charge that a retweeted video that showed Joe Biden stumbling during a recent speech was manipulated. The video was retweeted by President Trump on Saturday. The clip showed Biden in Missouri. Biden is seen addressing a crowd and the video ends with the former vice president saying, ""We can only re-elected Donald Trump."" The video got the attention of Twitter. The social media giant marked the video with a ""manipulated media"" tag, TechCrunch reported. It was the first time that the company took the step, but unveiled the policy last month.  The report said that Biden’s quote went further. Biden reportedly said, ""We can only re-elect Donald Trump if in fact we get engaged in this circular firing squad here. It’s gotta be a positive campaign."" Biden's campaign has been hampered by some of his gaffes. Perhaps the most memorable one was when he was in Des Moines and talked to the Iowa Asian and Latino Coalition. He was talking about education and at one point said, ""Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids."" He corrected himself and said, ""wealthy people, black kids, Asian kids."" GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Trump campaign has proven effective in using social media, but has been widely criticized for retweeting videos and comments from questionable origins.

Fox,         2020-03-08T233922-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/coronavirus-and-congress-likely-response,         Coronavirus and Congress' likely response in coming months,"                          366 confirmed coronavirus deaths in Italy as they implement a sweeping quarantine, 16 million people under lockdown. Amy Kellogg reports. Congress is a reactive body. It responds to events.  And here, with coronavirus, we have an “event.”  We’ve written about the late British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan in these spaces before. The story is somewhat apocryphal. But Macmillan is said to have proclaimed that “events” are the most important factor when setting the course of public policy. Macmillan wasn’t wrong.  STEVE HILTON: STOP THIS RECKLESS REACTION And that means that Congress and the Trump Administration will likely craft a series of measures to react and respond to coronavirus in the coming months. LATEST NEWS ON CORONAVIRUS The $8.3 billion measure okayed last week was mostly for health, readiness and vaccine development. Other measures will likely address everything else. The easy word to bat around is a “stimulus” measure. In the most conventional sense, a “stimulus” is an infusion of government cash to jolt the economy. President Obama and Congressional Democrats modeled their 2009 stimulus plan to bolster the economy after the “New Deal” of the 1930s. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and lawmakers authored a series of measures which changed fiscal regulations, created Social Security and launched a massive development of public works projects to respond to the Great Depression. It’s too early to completely understand the scope of coronavrius and if a “stimulus” could be required here.  But we are hearing chatter on Capitol Hill about tax cuts. More government spending. Rebates for travel. But unlike in 2009, it’s doubtful any legislation will simply be an infusion of cash centered around economic recovery. Infrastructure was a hallmark of the much-maligned 2009 stimulus plan engineered by Democrats. There are regular emanations from the Trump Administration about infrastructure. “Infrastructure week” is a running joke in Washington. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle would love to pursue an infrastructure package. Yet nothing ever happens. The Trump Administration and some Republicans on Capitol Hill spoke about “tax reform 2.0” long before coronavirus hit. But those discussions largely went nowhere. That’s partly because Democrats now control the House. There is also consternation in high tax states about how well voters received the new tax policy of a couple of years ago. There’s also a question whether Republicans really want to wade into the tax reform waters again. So let’s review what Congress did the last time it faced a fiscal crisis. In February, 2009, Congress approved what was initially billed as $787 billion economic stimulus package to shock the American economy into action after the Great Recession. The price tag of the measure eventually ballooned to $831 billion.  The Democratic House and Senate passed the plan in the first month of President Obama’s presidency. It consumed months to develop such a plan – and a new President. No Republicans in the House supported the bill. Only three GOP senators voted yea: Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Arlen Specter (R-PA). Granted, Congress responded with a $700 billion relief measure to salvage the economy in the fall of 2008 to cover losses in the financial sector. After an epic, initial failure in the House of Representatives (costing the market what was then it’s biggest point drop in a single day, in synchronicity with the bill blowing up on the House floor), Congress finally approved Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) in October, 2008. That was an immediate response because the economy teetered on the brink of collapse that autumn. But, it took a new Congress, a new President and time to assemble a full-blown stimulus package. Also, Congress and President Obama assembled a number of measures after the fiscal meltdown. There was the controversial “Dodd-Frank” financial re-regulation plan. There was also a federal rescue of the American auto industry. A contemporary package to respond to coronavirus would likely be an amalgam of tax credits for small businesses and travel, loans or even “bailouts” for damaged sectors of the economy (airlines?) and health assistance. There could also be a reduction of the “payroll tax.” If you go to the dictionary and look up the word “donnybrook,” you’ll see a picture of the internal fight waged between Congressional Republicans, over extending the payroll tax holiday in late 2011. This was a pitched, Christmastime battle royale. GOP fiscal hawks duked it out with fellow Republicans who wanted to trim taxes. And, it unfolded around the holidays because, as you know, only the zaniest worst-case scenarios unfold on Capitol Hill at Christmas.  In other words, it’s hard to have it both ways: keep taxes low yet reduce deficit spending. So what are the politics with a possible stimulus measure for coronavirus? Some Republicans are close to pushing for action – but up to a point. Those same Republicans who balked at President Obama’s stimulus plan will likely excoriate Democrats who championed the one in 2009 – and vice versa. Still, some Congressional Republicans may be tentative to call for major action, worried it would send a message of desperation and undercut President Trump. The optics of this are going to be complicated. Congressional maneuvering sends a message that lawmakers are on the case. But it can also sound alarm. At his briefing this week, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) seemed cool to cutting taxes. “I don’t know that talking about additional tax cuts now, other than for political purposes, is what we ought to be focused on,” said Hoyer. “What we ought to be focused on is what is our medical response to this.” When pressed further, Hoyer introduced an additional factor which could complicate a stimulus: Obamacare. The Maryland Democrat argued that the Trump Administration and Congressional Republicans are still trying to undo Obamacare. The Supreme Court will soon hear yet another case to overturn Obamacare. “It is ironic,” said Hoyer “That the administration says it wants to fight a major health challenge that is keeping America healthy.” Democrats are concerned that persons with “junk” health insurance plans won’t stay home from work because if they fall ill they lack adequate coverage. That could spread coronavrius. So, there could be an opportunity for Republicans to finally undercut Obamacare and replace it with something else to help respond to coronavirus.  Or…. It could mean that Republicans have to halt their attacks on Obamacare amid coronavirus and Obamacare expands far beyond its current form. Or…it could mean that coronavirus prompts a major recalibration of the American health care system.  Public opinion - and the death toll - will play heavily in all of this. If people don’t think they have sufficient health care in the coronavirus era, other options could look good. That may not mean “Medicare for All.” But it may alter the GOP’s decade-plus crusade to repeal and replace Obamacare. On Sunday night, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) took issue with the administration offering “tax breaks for major corporations” to cope with coronavirus. Pelosi and Schumer outlined a different set of proposals: Paid sick leave. Enhanced unemployment insurance. An expansion of food “security programs,” such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the food initiative for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). Protections for frontline health care workers. Widespread testing for coronavirus. Reimbursements for non-covered coronavirus-related costs. And, measures to guard against price gouging. “The administration must move more quickly and seriously to address the severe impacts of the coronavirus on the financial security of America’s families,” said Pelosi and Schumer. These are all proposals which will cost money. They will all likely require legislation. And, to become law, they have to go through President Trump. GET THE FOX NEWS APP The legislative response will take a while to sort out. Look at how long it took Congress to counter some aspects of the 2008 financial crisis. There may be immediate steps Congress takes as certain demands become evident. But the “big stuff” is likely a long way off.    "

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Donald Trump Jr. wants to debate Hunter Biden in a bid to prove the former vice president’s son has financially benefited more than him from their fathers’ government positions. President Trump’s eldest son offered up the idea in an “Axios on HBO” interview that aired Sunday night. “You know what will be great, I’ll let you host it. You moderate a debate between Hunter Biden and myself,” he told Axios co-founder Jim Vandehei. Trump Jr. added: “We can go full transparency. We show everything, and we can talk about all of the places where I’m supposedly grifting, but Hunter Biden isn’t.” Republicans, including Trump, have repeatedly scrutinized Hunter’s lucrative position on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma while his father, Joe Biden, was vice president. “Hunter Biden, his father becomes VP. All of a sudden he goes over to Ukraine and he’s making 83 grand a month,” Trump Jr. said in the interview. Trump Jr. claimed Sunday night that, unlike Hunter, he has not profited from his father’s presidential position. Vandehei pointed out paid speeches given by Trump Jr., and his best-selling book, “Triggered: How The Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us,’’ which was published last November.

Amy Kellogg reports. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, issued a statement Sunday revealing that he had interacted with an attendee at last month’s Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) who had tested positive for the coronavirus -- and as a result, he'll stay at home until two weeks have passed since the encounter. Shortly afterward, Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., announced he and three additional staffers were “under self-quarantine” after “sustained contact” with a virus patient. Officials with the American Conservative Union (ACU), which hosted CPAC, said Saturday the attendee had been exposed before the conference, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed his case.       Sen. Ted Cruz R-Texas, speaks to the media during the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.      (AP) Cruz said his interaction with that individual “consisted of a brief conversation and a handshake.” “I’m not experiencing any symptoms, and I feel fine and healthy. Given that the interaction was 10 days ago, that the average incubation period is 5-6 days, that the interaction was for less than a minute, and that I have no current symptoms, the medical authorities have advised me that the odds of transmission from the other individual to me were extremely low,” Cruz said.  CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE  He added that he did not meet the CDC criteria for self-quarantine because testing was not effective before symptoms manifest.  “The medical authorities explicitly advised me that, given the above criteria, the people who have interacted with me in the 10 days since CPAC should not be concerned about potential transmission,” Cruz said.  The senator said he has decided to remain at his home in Texas until 14 days have passed since the CPAC interaction because of how frequently he interacts with his constituents and “to give everyone peace of mind.”  CONNECTICUT GOVERNOR ANNOUNCES STATE’S FIRST CORONAVIRUS CASE  “Everyone should continue to treat this outbreak seriously and be driven by facts and medical science. We need to continue to be proactive in mobilizing resources to combat this outbreak—including the $8.3 billion in emergency funding we provided last week—and I encourage everyone to follow the recommendations of the CDC and other health professionals in protecting their own health and welfare, as well as the health and welfare of those around them,” Cruz said.  Gosar later tweeted: “I am announcing that I, along with 3 of my senior staff, are officially under self-quarantine after sustained contact at CPAC with a person who has since been hospitalized with the Wuhan Virus. My office will be closed for the week.” He added, “We are all asymptomatic and feel great. But we are being proactive and cautious.” Also Sunday, ACU officials said they were working with the Maryland Department of Health since the CPAC conference was held in that state. The Department of Health has screened thousands of employees from the Gaylord National Resort and Conference Center and the Residence Inn, ACU said.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  “At this time, not a single person has reported any unusual illness. Thus the Dept of Health is not restricting movements or interactions with others of those hotel employees,” ACU said. “We continue to remain in close contact with the infected individual and he continues to be doing better. Also at this point, no other CPAC attendee, participant or staff has tested positive for coronavirus.”  Fox News’ Melissa Leon contributed to this report.     "
Fox,         2020-03-08T170232-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/biden-sanders-sit-down-debate-format-push-health-concerns,         Biden pushes for sit-down debate format amid mounting health-related concerns,"                          Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders battle for the Democratic presidential nomination ahead of the Michigan primary; Fox News senior political correspondent Mike Emanuel reports. Bernie Sanders' campaign is accusing Joe Biden of pushing for a sit-down format at the March 15 presidential primary debate in Phoenix, according to a new report that highlights mounting concerns over the 77-year-old former vice president's stamina and cognitive ability. Sanders' team raised the alarm about the sit-down format during a Friday call with CNN, which is set to moderate the debate along with the Democratic National Committee (DNC), Politico reported this weekend.  All previous primary debates this cycle have required candidates to stand at podiums; and during his one-on-one debates with Hillary Clinton in 2016, Sanders stood alongside her. ""Why does Joe Biden not want to stand toe-to-toe with Sen. Sanders on the debate stage March 15 and have an opportunity to defend his record and articulate his vision for the future?"" senior Sanders advisor Jeff Weaver told the outlet. The Biden campaign denied it had anything to do with the proposed new format. Biden has stood for each of the previous debates, but the upcoming one-on-one with Sanders is expected to be a more grueling and taxing event. (Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, will be excluded from the debate under new DNC rules requiring that each candidate have received a large number of delegates.) ""We will participate in whatever debate CNN chooses to stage: standing, sitting, at podiums or in a town hall,"" Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield told Politico. ""The problem for the Sanders campaign is not the staging of the debate, but rather, the weakness of Sen. Sanders’ record and ideas."" Bedingfield added that during the joint call with CNN and the campaigns, the Biden team ""agreed to the format that CNN proposed"" -- and that after Sanders objected, the Biden ""campaign agreed to a modification of that format that CNN proposed, to compromise with both campaigns."" The nature of that modification was unclear, but the DNC has suggested the format would change to become more intimate. Sit-down-style debates are not unprecedented; in 2012, Biden sat across from then-Rep. Paul Ryan at a vice presidential debate, and in 2008, the-candidate Barack Obama debated Clinton at a roundtable. HUNTER BIDEN DEFYING COURT ORDER TO TURN OVER FINANCIAL DOCS, CONTEMPT MOTION SAYS ""After 10 debates, the DNC worked with its network partners to adapt the March debate to the smaller field of candidates and to give voters more of a voice. This format provides candidates longer response times, and for the first time, will incorporate questions from undecided voters in the audience,"" DNC spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said. Thus far, Biden's debate performances have been largely underwhelming, analysts have said. He has suggested that most Americans owned ""record players"" and could use them to connect with children, declared that half of the country has been killed by gun violence since 2007, and baffled audience members by telling them to ""go to Joe 30330."" Republicans, meanwhile, have made Biden's possible health issues a major part of their messaging, and there were signs that the attacks weren't simply political. Obama's longtime doctor, for example, has flatly remarked in an interview with The Washington Examiner that Biden was ""not a healthy guy."" ""He's not in bad shape for his age, but I wouldn't say he’s in outstanding health,"" Dr. David Scheiner said last year, after reviewing partial medical records. ""Could I guarantee he won't have issues for the next four years? He has a lot of issues that are just sort of sitting there."" On Sunday, Trump mocked Biden's gaffe-marked, seven-minute speech in St. Louis the day before. TRUMP EMBRACES MUDDLED BIDEN 'ENDORSEMENT' During the brief address, Biden declared:  ""If you want a nominee who will bring this party together, who will run a progressive, positive campaign, and turn, turn this primary from a campaign that's about negative attacks into one that's about what we're for -- because we cannot get -- re-elect -- we cannot win this re-election -- excuse me. We can only re-elect Donald Trump -- if, in fact, we get engaged in this circular firing squad here. Gotta be a positive campaign, so join us.""

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And, Trump suggested at a Fox News Town Hall last week that Biden wasn't fit for office, saying that Biden's numerous gaffes were indicative of a competency issue. ""I'm all set for Bernie, communist,"" Trump began. ""And then, we have this crazy thing that happened on Tuesday, which he thought was Thursday. But, he also said 150 million people were killed with guns, and that he was running for the U.S. Senate -- there's something going on there.""    "

Elise Stefanik receiving a 'vile anonymous note' on her car. Joe Biden is racking up endorsements from former rivals and Democratic insiders, but a gaffe-riddled 7-minute speech on Saturday in St. Louis, Missouri, led President Trump to tweet out an edited clip that appears to have the former vice president endorse the current commander in chief. During the brief address, Biden, 77, declared: ""If you want a nominee who will bring this party together, who will run a progressive, positive campaign, and turn, turn this primary from a campaign that's about negative attacks into one that's about what we're for -- because we cannot get -- re-elect -- we cannot win this re-election -- excuse me. We can only re-elect Donald Trump -- if, in fact, we get engaged in this circular firing squad here. Gotta be a positive campaign, so join us."" Biden also bizarrely described himself as an ""O'Biden Bama"" Democrat, transposing his name and the name of his old boss. The muddled remarks led to renewed concerns from both Republicans and left-of-center commentators that Biden may be mentally unfit for the presidency. On Twitter, President Trump jokingly took Biden's speech as a mangled endorsement. ""I agree with Joe!"" Trump wrote, captioning a video of the address that edited out the second part of Biden's remarks. The tweet was part of a larger effort by Republicans to point out what they see as one of Biden's fatal vulnerabilities, along with his son's possible corruption. Trump suggested at a Fox News Town Hall last week that Biden isn't fit for office, saying that Biden's numerous gaffes were indicative of a competency issue. ""I'm all set for Bernie, communist,"" Trump began. ""And then we have this crazy thing that happened on Tuesday, which he thought was Thursday. But he also said 150 million people were killed with guns, and that he was running for the U.S. Senate -- there's something going on there."" With Biden set to potentially deliver a knockout blow to Bernie Sanders during Tuesday's Michigan primary, some doctors and even some left-of-center commentators are agreeing with the president's assessment. Former President Obama's longtime physician has flatly remarked in an interview with The Washington Examiner that Biden is ""not a healthy guy."" ""He’s not a healthy guy."" “He’s not in bad shape for his age, but I wouldn't say he’s in outstanding health,"" Dr. David Scheiner said last year, after reviewing partial medical records. ""Could I guarantee he won't have issues for the next four years? He has a lot of issues that are just sort of sitting there.” HUNTER BIDEN DEFYING COURT ORDER TO TURN OVER FINANCIAL DOCS, CONTEMPT MOTION SAYS Popular podcast host Joe Rogan, who has endorsed Bernie Sanders, took the concerns a step further, saying Biden's alleged cognitive problems were disqualifying. ""Stop. Pause. He can't be president,"" Rogan said. ""Listen, we can't play any games here folks. This is a really old man who can't talk."" On Sunday, Glenn Greenwald countered accusations on social media that he was mentioning what he called Biden's ""obvious cognitive issues"" only to help Sanders, noting that he has been writing about them for months. Journalist Aaron Mate has pointed out the relative lack of scrutiny for Biden in the network media, which with some exceptions has largely steered clear of probing the former vice president's overseas dealings or his possible cognitive issues. ""When's the last time Joe Biden sat for a live, unedited interview like Bernie did this week w/ Maddow?"" Mate asked. ""For example, I'd love to know what Biden said here after claiming Hunter got his $80K/month Ukraine board gig because 'he's a really bright guy.' But it's clearly edited."" And, last summer, The New York Times reported that many Biden associates and insiders were doubting with ""significant unease"" whether he would be too old to serve as an effective candidate. Meanwhile, reports have emerged that the format for the next presidential debate will allow Biden and his opponent to sit down -- prompting the Sanders campaign to suggest Biden is getting favorable treatment. “Why does Joe Biden not want to stand toe-to-toe with Sen. Sanders on the debate stage March 15 and have an opportunity to defend his record and articulate his vision for the future?” Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ senior adviser, told Politico. For now, though, Biden is largely basking in the support of a mostly unified Democratic Party -- even picking up the endorsement of Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who just last year accused Biden of supporting what she called racist policies that affected her personally. ""There is no one better prepared than Joe to steer our nation through these turbulent times, and restore truth, honor, and decency to the Oval Office,"" Harris said in a statement Sunday. ""He is kind and endlessly caring, and he truly listens to the American people."" Harris joins Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke, ex-New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohion, former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, and former Maryland Congressman John Delaney in endorsing Biden. Harris withdrew from the race in December, ending a candidacy with the historic potential of becoming the first black woman elected president.

Four years after Hillary Clinton was the party's nominee, ""we find ourselves without any woman on a path to be the Democratic nominee for president."" Rep.

Kevin McCarthy breaks down how the White House is tackling the outbreak and how Congress is planning to deal with the threat of a slowing economy. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, D-Calif., continued the Republican assault on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., for his comments last week about Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. McCarthy said that Schumer’s comments, which came as the court heard arguments in a high-profile abortion case, were meant to influence the justices’ decisions and that Democrats in the Senate should replace the New York senator as their party’s leader. “He's standing before the Supreme Court trying to influence the outcome in America,” McCarthy said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures.” “We believe we encourage the exchange of ideas not to the idea that you're going to intimidate.” McCarthy added: “If I was a Democrat in the Senate, I would have changed my leadership if this was what was happening.” MCCONNELL CALLS SCHUMER'S RESPONSE TO SUPREME COURT NOT 'MUCH OF AN APOLOGY' Schumer has taken heat following his comments at a pro-choice rally last week, where he called the case, June Medical Services LLC v. Russo, the first ""major"" abortion case since President Trump's court picks have been on the bench. The dispute, dealing with restrictions over who can perform abortions, involves a Louisiana law similar to one in Texas that the court ruled unconstitutional in 2016, before either Trump justice was on the Supreme Court and before conservatives held a 5-4 majority. ""I want to tell you, Gorsuch. I want to tell you, Kavanaugh. You have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price!"" Schumer warned. ""You won’t know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions."" Video of the remarks quickly circulated on social media, with Republicans casting the warning as a threat against two sitting Supreme Court justices. Schumer attempted to walk back his statements, claiming his words didn't come out right because of his state of mind at the time.  “I’m from Brooklyn. We speak in strong language. I shouldn’t have used the words I did, but in no way was I making a threat,” he said on the Senate floor Thursday. “I feel so deeply the anger of women all across America about Senate Republicans and the courts working hand in glove to take down Roe v. Wade."" Hours after the rally where Schumer appeared, Chief Justice John Roberts issued a statement singling out the senator's comments.  CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP “Justices know that criticism comes with the territory, but threatening statements of this sort from the highest levels of government are not only inappropriate, they are dangerous,"" Roberts said.  It was only the second time the chief justice has responded to criticism of individual judges. In 2018, Roberts rebuked Trump for the president's criticism of an ""Obama judge."" But Roberts has otherwise stayed silent, including in recent weeks when Trump questioned the impartiality of Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor, and of U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who presided over the trial and sentencing of Trump ally Roger Stone. Senate Republicans did not criticize those comments. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., himself came under criticism in August when his campaign tweeted a photo of signs that were shaped like tombstones with names of Judge Merrick Garland, President Obama's nominee to replace Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, and Democrat Amy McGrath, McConnell's likely 2020 election opponent.

Fox,         2020-02-16T134725-0500,https://foxnews.com/politics/hunter-bidens-controversies-explained,         Hunter Biden scandals explained Ukraine,"                          Hunter Biden, son of 2020 democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, has faced many scandals. Starting in 2008, with his dealings in Delaware, and ending with his love child last year, young Biden has been criticized from both sides of the political spectrum. From his eyebrow-raising dealings in Delaware, China and Ukraine to controversies involving drug use and child support, Hunter Biden is no stranger to scandal. The son of former vice president and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has faced accusations of corrupt behavior from both sides of the political aisle, and played a starring role in the recently concluded impeachment proceedings against President Trump. The younger Biden's distinct scandals are best understood in rough chronological order because Republicans have argued that Biden's apparently irresponsible behavior only made it more likely that his later sweetheart gigs were obtained not through merit, but because of connections that he could monetize. In 2008, both The New York Times and The American Spectator highlighted Hunter Biden's sweetheart gigs while his father rose in political prominence. The articles, written as Barack Obama and John McCain vied for the White House, found that Hunter Biden received consulting fees from the financial services company MBNA from 2001 to 2005 — while his father, then a senator, was pushing successfully for legislation that would make it harder for consumers to file for bankruptcy protection. The precise amount of the payments was unclear, but a company official once said Hunter Biden was receiving at least a $100,000 per year retainer, the Times reported. Hunter Biden, now 49, previously had been an executive at MBNA beginning in 1996, but the consulting fees came years after his departure from the company as a full-time employee. Aides to then-presidential candidate Barack Obama at the time denied that any lobbying had occurred, and insisted the payments were proper. However, that explanation was immediately treated with skepticism. The Trump campaign recently posted a contemporaneous interview in which an incredulous Tom Brokaw asked Joe Biden whether it was ""inappropriate"" for the then-senator to have his son ""collecting money from this big credit card company while you were on the [Senate] floor protecting its interests."" Hunter Biden's previous work as an executive at MBNA from 1996 to 1998 also has raised what critics called red flags. Rachel Mullen, a former senior personal banking officer at MBNA from 1994-2001 who later went into Republican politics, tweeted that managers referred to the younger Biden as ""Senator MBNA"" after he was hired into a lucrative management-prep track right after he graduated from Yale Law School. An MBNA source who previously worked at the company told Fox News that other employees heard Hunter Biden boasting that his salary was unusually high, even for the management-prep track — which was widely seen in the company as a way to groom and pamper well-connected executive candidates with powerful family members.

(AP Photo/Elise Amendola)       The source said Biden's ""Senator MBNA"" nickname was not politically motivated, but rather reflected a widely held belief among managers – who did not work directly with Biden – that he essentially was engaged in lobbying. The Bidens' connections with MBNA apparently ran deep. In a January 2008 article entitled ""The Senator from MBNA,"" columnist Byron York recounted how then-MBNA vice chairman John Cochran paid ""top dollar"" for Joe Biden's home in February 1996, just prior to his Senate reelection bid, and that ""MBNA gave Cochran a lot of money – $330,000– to help with 'expenses' related to the move."" The $1.2M sale was a ""pretty darned good deal for Biden,"" York wrote, noting that ""Cochran simply paid Biden’s full asking price"" even though the ""house needed quite a bit of work; contractors and their trucks descended on the house for months after the purchase."" Asked how Cochran and Biden found each other for the sale, an MBNA spokesperson told York: ""That’s a very personal question."" Aside from MBNA during this period, the younger Biden worked at a lobbying firm and served on the board of Amtrak -- a prestigious role he apparently obtained through his connections, although Democrats claimed he deserved the post because he traveled regularly on trains. ""Hunter Biden has spent a lot of time on Amtrak trains. Like his father, like our congressman, Mike Castle, and myself, Hunter Biden has lived in Delaware while using Amtrak to commute to his job as we commute to our job in Washington almost every day of the week,"" Democratic Delaware Sen. Tom Carper said at a hearing on Biden's nomination to the Amtrak board in June 2006. ""You know, you learn a lot about what could work and what would work better at Amtrak by riding trains and talking to the passengers, the commuters, the passengers, the folks who work on the trains and make them work every day."" In 2014, Hunter was kicked out of the military after testing positive for cocaine. The Navy said that Biden, a former lobbyist who worked at a private equity firm, was discharged barely a year after he was selected for his part-time position as a public affairs officer in the Navy Reserve. Two people familiar with the situation quickly told the media that Biden was discharged because he failed a drug test in 2013. The Wall Street Journal first reported Biden’s discharge and failed drug test. TREASURY COMPLIES WITH HUNTER BIDEN INQUIRY, HANDS OVER SENSITIVE DOCS An attorney by training, Biden applied to join the Navy Reserve as a public affairs officer and was selected in 2012 — one of seven candidates recommended for a direct commission for public affairs. A board of senior Navy officers interviewed Biden before making the recommendation.       Photo exclusively obtained by Fox News shows Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, and Devon Archer golfing. The elder Biden has denied discussing his overseas business dealings with his son.       Because he was 42 at the time, he needed a special waiver to be accepted. Cmdr. Ryan Perry, a spokesman for the Navy, said Biden had been assigned to the Navy Public Affairs Support Element East, based in Norfolk, Va. Hunter Biden and and his friend Devon Archer joined the natural gas company Burisma Holdings board in April 2014. Biden apparently cannot speak Ukrainian and had no relevant natural gas experience. Joe Biden has acknowledged on camera that in spring 2016, when he was vice president and spearheading the Obama administration's Ukraine policy, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire top prosecutor Viktor Shokin. At the time, Shokin was investigating the notoriously corrupt Burisma Holdings — where Hunter's role was especially lucrative. The vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion in critical U.S. aid if Shokin was not fired. ""Well, son of a b---h, he got fired,"" Biden joked at a panel two years after leaving office. Shokin himself had already been widely accused of corruption. WHOOPS: BIDEN CAMPAIGN TOUTS UKRAINE ACTIVIST WHO CALLED HUNTER'S ACTIONS 'VERY BAD' Critics alleged Hunter Biden might have been selling access to his father, who had pushed Ukraine to increase its natural gas production. Government officials have raised similar concerns. During the House impeachment proceedings, a career State Department employee testified that he had flagged Hunter Biden's apparent conflict of interest, but was told essentially not to bother the vice president's office. ""Impossible to justify $50k/month for Hunter Biden serving on a Ukrainian energy board w zero expertise unless he promised to sell access,"" political scientist Ian Bremmer previously tweeted. Joe Biden has said he never discussed his son's overseas business dealings -- an assertion seemingly contradicted by both his son and a photo exclusively obtained by Fox News. “I know I did nothing wrong at all. Was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is a swamp in many ways? Yeah,"" Hunter Biden said in an exclusive sit-down with ABC's Amy Robach at his Los Angeles home last October. TENSIONS FLARE IN CONGRESS, AS GOP REP BRINGS UP HUNTER BIDEN'S COCAINE USE He acknowledged he may not have gotten the job were it not for his connections to the vice presidency. In the ABC News report last year which also delved into the Bidens' China dealings, journalist Tom Llamas called it ""strange"" that Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings, widely accused of corruption, had appointed Hunter Biden to its board of directors -- and agreed to pay Hunter Biden's company ""more than a million dollars a year."" ""Hunter -- a lawyer, who had just been discharged from the Navy Reserves for testing positive for cocaine,"" Llamas says incredulously. ""He had served on other boards, but had no known experience in Ukraine or natural gas."" Earlier this month, the Treasury Department complied with a Senate inquiry into the younger Biden's business dealings in Ukraine and reportedly handed over highly sensitive financial records and ""evidence of questionable origin."" Top Republican senators recently requested travel records from the Secret Service that might shed light on Hunter Biden's dealings in China, which Trump has long said merit a state investigation. Much of the focus concerns Biden's position as one of nine directors at BHR -- a private-equity company controlled by Chinese government-backed stakeholders. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said the arrangement raised red flags.       Hunter Biden on Oct. 11, 2012, waiting for the start of the his father's, Vice President Joe Biden's, debate at Centre College in Danville, Ky. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File)       ""In December of 2013, one month after Rosemont Seneca's joint venture with Bohai Capital to form BHR, Hunter Biden reportedly flew aboard Air Force Two with then-Vice President Biden to China,"" the senators wrote. ""While in China, he helped arrange for Jonathan Li, CEO of Bohai Capital, to 'shake hands' with Vice President Biden."" ""Afterward,"" they continued, ""Hunter Biden met with Li for reportedly a 'social meeting.' After the China trip, BHR's business license was approved. Then, in 2015, BHR joined with Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) to acquire Henniges, which was the 'biggest Chinese investment into U.S. automotive manufacturing assets to date.'"" The senators also sought travel records relating to Biden's trips to Ukraine, if any. Last year, Biden stepped down from the board of BHR and said he wouldn't take similar roles if his father won the presidency. The Wall Street Journal reported that BHR Partners filings show that while Hunter was a director of BHR since its founding, he didn't become a shareholder until October 2017. Trump has specifically accused Biden of walking ""out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund.” The Journal reported in 2014 that BHR was trying to raise that much money to invest outside of China, but it's otherwise unclear what the president was referencing. In January of this year Hunter Biden agreed to pay monthly child support retroactive to November 2018, temporarily ending a standoff that began after the judge in his Arkansas paternity case ordered him to appear in person for a hearing to explain why he shouldn't be held in contempt. But, the standoff reignited in March, when Biden apparently failed to meet a court deadline to turn over additional financial documents. Republicans suggested he was hiding evidence of corruption. The matter remains pending. Biden had previously denied paternity, before a DNA test proved otherwise. HUNTER BIDEN FINALLY AGREES TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT FOR KID FATHERED WITH EX-STRIPPER The court redacted the amount of child support that Biden agreed to pay, pursuant to his agreement with plaintiff Lunden Alexis Roberts, who alleged Biden was an entirely absent father. However, Independence County Circuit Court Judge Holly Meyer noted that she ""lacks sufficient information"" to determine the appropriate amount of ""permanent"" child support ""based off the defendant's income,"" and that modifications to the child support owed each month could be made based on additional evidence. Contempt proceedings over Biden's repeated failure to turn over relevant financial documents were only delayed until March 1, and Biden apparently has not resolved the issue. ""After months of hiding, one has to wonder if the reason Hunter Biden continues to defy the court is because there are financial documents could shed light on his father’s massive conflicts of interest as vice president,"" Republican National Committee (RNC) spokesman Steve Guest told Fox News. READ THE ORDER REQUIRING BIDEN TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT The paternity dispute has presented headaches for the elder Biden ever since a court filing showed that DNA results indicated he was now a grandfather. Joe Biden tangled with a Fox News reporter on camera when asked about that development last November. ""No one has said my son has done anything wrong."" ""I'm wondering if you have a comment on this report, and court filing, out of Arkansas, that your son Hunter just made you a grandfather again,"" Fox News’ Peter Doocy asked. ""No, that’s a private matter and I have no comment,"" Biden fired back before attacking the reporter. ""Only you would ask that,"" Biden said. ""You're a good man. You're a good man. Classy."" Campaigning late last year, Biden has also lashed out at voters -- even appearing to call one man ""fat"" for bringing up issues with his son's possible corruption and questioning his fitness for office. “You’re a damn liar, man,"" Biden said. “Let’s do push-ups together here, man. Let’s run. Let’s do whatever you want to do. Let’s take an IQ test. ... No one has said my son has done anything wrong."" The Associated Press contributed to this report.    "
Fox,         2020-03-09T162213-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/bernie-sanders-fox-news-town-hall-michigan,         Bernie Sanders,"                          Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders joins moderators Martha MacCallum and Bret Baier for a Fox News town hall in Dearborn, Michigan. As his struggling campaign seeks a big win in Michigan's Tuesday primary, Bernie Sanders took the stage at a Fox News Town Hall in Detroit and wasted little time in dismissing front-runner Joe Biden as a friend to ""crooks"" -- and former rival Hillary Clinton as a seemingly bitter ex-candidate stuck in the past. ""I always give this guy a hard time,"" Sanders joked at the outset, referring to Fox News Channel anchor Bret Baier, who was hosting the town hall alongside Martha MacCallum. ""This is going to be fun tonight,"" Baier responded. Within minutes, Sanders took aim at the former vice president, saying Biden had ""bailed out the crooks on Wall Street who nearly destroyed our economy 12 years ago."" That $700 billion rescue plan also had the support of then-presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain. Questioned about Biden's recent verbal gaffes and his broader competence, Sanders remarked, ""I'm not here to criticize Joe, but to say that I think the American people at this incredibly complicated and difficult moment in our history, are entitled to thoughtful answers to the crises we face.""       Fox News Channel anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum question Sanders at the Fox News Town Hall on Monday in Detroit, Mich.       ""I'm not gonna go to that level -- that's for people to decide,"" Sanders added, when Baier presented video of Democrats criticizing the former vice president's mental fitness for elected office. ""I’m not going to be making personal attacks on Joe."" The Biden campaign has repeatedly refused Fox News Channel's invitations to participate in a town hall. Separately, prompted by a recent video clip of Clinton claiming that ""nobody likes"" Sanders and that he ""didn't work until he was 41,"" Sanders responded: ""Unlike Secretary Clinton, I don't want to relive 2016. We're in 2020 now."" ""But, what I would say on a good day, is my wife likes me,"" Sanders said to applause. ""But also, if you guys look at some of the polling they do for United States senators, in most cases I turn out to be the most popular senator in the country."" (At the end of the town hall, in response to a question as to who his closest friend is in Washington, Sanders said, ""My wife."") Later, seeking to assure a voter from Russia that his brand of ""democratic socialism"" would not bring widespread poverty and despair to the United States, Sanders said he instead wanted a country more like Denmark, Finland and Sweden. ""What happened in the Soviet Union was not socialism, it was authoritarian communism,"" Sanders said as attendees cheered. ""I'm not an expert on the current economy in Sweden,"" Sanders responded when MacCallum noted Sweden was pushing towards more deregulation and less taxes, and that the population in the U.S. is much larger than that of the Nordic countries. ""They have gone a long way to eliminate poverty, to make sure that all of their people have the basic needs that they need to live good lives."" Sanders said studies have shown that countries like Denmark are among the ""happiest on earth,"" because they provide various free services like college and health care. Other studies, however, have showed that Denmark essentially free-rides heavily from U.S. capitalism, and argue that mimicking their welfare programs may backfire. Sanders also slammed President Trump's response to the coronavirus outbreak -- and said that he would not consider closing the border, no matter what. ""If you had to, would you close down the borders?"" Baier asked, referring to efforts to stop the spread of coronavirus. ""No,"" Sanders replied flatly. He went on to condemn xenophobia and suggest that scientists would need to outline the appropriate approach. Sanders also hit Trump's appointment of Vice President Mike Pence to lead the coronavirus task force and inaccurately claimed that Trump had advised Americans with the virus to head to work. In fact, Trump told Fox News ""Hannity"" that, empirically, some Americans are going to work with the virus and recovering without incident. ""Sadly, we have an administration in Washington that has shown the world that it does not believe in science,"" Sanders said, taking aim at the White House on issues from climate change to health care. ""When you appoint Vice President Pence, an individual who also doesn't much believe in science, what you're telling the whole world is that you're politicizing this issue."" ""I'm not an expert on the current economy in Sweden."" Baier pressed Sanders on the coronavirus response, saying that Trump has in fact appointed numerous experts to address the issue. Sanders responded by mocking Trump's claim to have a ""natural ability"" to address disasters. ""You listen to the scientists; you don't say stupid things,"" Sanders said. ""You don't suggest to people they can go to work."" Sanders returned to his talking points about the wealthiest people not paying their ""fair share"" in taxes, leading MacCallum to probe whether Sanders would reconsider his policies given the ongoing stock market crisis. SANDERS RELEASES DETAILS ON HOW HE'D PAY FOR MAJOR PROPOSALS -- ARE THERE ISSUES? ""I will not become president until January, and the economic situation will be different then,"" Sanders said. As to what he would do if he were president today, Sanders said an ""economic stimulus"" could come in the form of ""invest[ing] in working-class people in good-paying jobs by rebuiling our crumbling infrastructure -- roads, bridges."" He added that ""I'm not here to demonize anybody,"" after MacCallum pointed out that Bill Gates is contributing substantially to coronavirus efforts. At the same time, Sanders said, it was absurd to depend upon the ""generosity"" of billionaires. Then, in a dramatic call-and-response moment with the audience at the town hall, Sanders established that Canada is not a socialist or communist system of government and yet manages to provide government-run health care at a minimal cost to patients. The president, for his part, has derided Canada's health-care system and pointed out that even Canadians complain about their long waiting times, relatively substandard care, and high taxes. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders joins moderators Martha MacCallum and Bret Baier for a Fox News town hall in Dearborn, Michigan. The Vermont senator acknowledged that taxes would go up by 4 percent at a minimum to incomes over $29,000, in additional to more payroll taxes on employers and stock market transaction taxes, but asserted that ""comprehensive"" health care is worth it. Sanders said he wanted a ""modest"" tax on ""Wall Street speculation."" The proposal, according to Sanders' campaign, specifically would place a ""0.5 percent tax on stock trades – 50 cents on every $100 of stock – a 0.1 percent fee on bond trades, and a 0.005 percent fee on derivative trades."" Sanders' campaign has claimed that a ""modest tax on Wall Street speculation ... will raise an estimated $2.4 trillion over ten years"" and, in one fell swoop, make all ""public colleges, universities and trade schools tuition-free ... and cancel all student debt over the next decade."" However, the National Review has likened a tax on so-called ""Wall Street speculation"" to a de facto tax on savings, and asserted the Sanders plan is untested and ""would mean paying $25 to the federal government every time you traded $5,000 worth of stock — or five times what you’d pay the typical online brokerage in fees. ... Over the long term, that imposes serious costs on actively traded funds such as the ones containing many Americans’ retirement funds.""       Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rev. Jesse Jackson wave to the crowd at a rally for Sanders at Calder Plaza in Grand Rapids, Michigan on Sunday, March 8, 2020. Michigan's presidential primary is Tuesday. (Anntaninna Biondo/The Grand Rapids Press via AP)       At the town hall, Sanders alluded to a disputed Yale University study to argue that ""Medicare-for-all"" would save money largely by cutting down on administrative costs. Other nonpartisan estimates have put the cost of Sanders' ""Medicare-for-all"" proposal at over $32 trillion. Baier and MacCallum moderated Sanders’ second Fox News Town Hall of the election cycle. At last April's event, a combative Sanders made no apologizes for his wealth, and acknowledged that his plans would lead to tax hikes for many Americans. Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington will also hold primaries on Tuesday, and a combined 352 delegates will be at stake. Michigan's 125 pledged delegates are perhaps the day's biggest prize and offer Sanders an opportunity to cut down front-runner Joe Biden's current 91-delegate lead. SANDERS HIRES ADVISOR WHO BLAMED AMERICA FOR 9/11 Sanders won the Michigan primary over Hillary Clinton in 2016 after taking a beating on Super Tuesday, but this year, surveys show him down by as many as two-dozen points. Biden tops Sanders 51 percent to 36 percent among likely Democratic presidential primary voters in Michigan, a Monmouth University survey released on Monday showed. An outstanding question going into Tuesday is whether Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who dropped out of the race last week, will endorse Biden or Sanders. So far, she's declined to back either, an especially frustrating development for Sanders, who could use Warren's help in unifying progressives in much the same way Biden has been able to rally moderates. Sanders tells Fox News he wouldn't close US borders during coronavirus-type contagion Sanders has scoffed at suggestions he could drop out if he doesn't win Michigan, but his travel schedule underscores its importance. He canceled a trip to Mississippi and instead made five campaign stops across Michigan since Friday. And he was holding a roundtable in Detroit on Monday with health experts to discuss the spread of the new coronavirus. Sanders has accused Biden of relying on billionaires to finance his campaign but also says he's now running against “the Democratic establishment.” The senator told Fox News on Sunday that he'd win Michigan and repeated that at a rally in Grand Rapids, but he added the major caveat for supporters that he'd only pull it off “if we stick together, we bring our friends out to vote.” FLASHBACK: AT TESTY FNC TOWN HALL, SANDERS MAKES NO APOLOGIES FOR MAKING MILLIONS Sanders won't say if he's personally lobbying Warren for her endorsement. He did manage to secure the backing of Jesse Jackson, who said it was no time for centrist compromise. “With the exception of Native Americans, African-Americans are the people who are most behind socially and economically in the United States and our needs are not moderate,"" Jackson said at Sanders' Grand Rapids rally. “A people far behind cannot catch up choosing the most moderate path.” Still, one of Sanders' highest-profile supporters, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, struck a far more conciliatory tone addressing 10,000-plus on the campus of the University of Michigan on Sunday night, saying, “In order for us to win, we have to grow.”       President Donald Trump gestures while walking on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington on Monday after stepping off Marine One. A “Women for Trump” bus tour has been canceled, the president’s campaign said, citing scheduling conflicts. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)       “We must be inclusive. We must bring more people into this movement,"" she said, urging Sanders supporters to shed “cynicism and exclusion” and “turn with an embracing posture, where all people are welcome in a people's movement.” Sanders is hoping to do well in Washington state on Tuesday, but could face hurdles in Mississippi and Missouri. Sanders' team acknowledges he will also struggle in next week's Florida primary, where the senator's past defense of Fidel Castro looms large. He also could face long odds in Ohio and Illinois — especially if he underperforms in Michigan. Both of those states also vote March 17. The wild card next week could be Arizona, where Sanders will be counting on strong Latino support, which lifted him to victory in California. MARCH 10 PRIMARY PRIMER: THE STATES AND THE STAKES The intricate arithmetic of how delegates are won makes it possible Tuesday for a winning candidate to reap a bigger haul of delegates with a smaller margin of victory than any other night. This gives Biden an opportunity to greatly increase his lead over Sanders or for Sanders to close the gap. Delegates are mostly awarded proportionally in congressional districts. And nearly two-thirds of Tuesday districts have an odd number of delegates up for grabs. When there is an odd number of delegates available, that means one of the two candidates will get more delegates. In districts with an even number of delegates, proportional distribution means that in close races, both candidates get the same number of delegates and that makes it more difficult for Sanders to catch Biden. After March 17, most delegates are in districts with an even number of delegates. Monday's Sanders Fox News Town Hall was the eleventh town hall of the current election season hosted by Fox News and the tenth with a Democratic presidential candidate. FNC’s first town hall with Sanders held the record for the most-watched town hall of the 2020 election cycle with nearly 2.6 million viewers, before Trump's town hall dethroned it with a whopping 4.2 million viewers. Recent Fox News town halls were held with then-Democratic presidential candidates Mike Bloomberg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, both co-moderated by Baier and MacCallum, as well as former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, moderated by Chris Wallace.

Fox,         2020-03-09T155153-0400,https://foxnews.com/politics/gop-rep-doug-coronavirus-self-quarantine,         Two GOP reps self-quarantine after contact with coronavirus patient,"                          'Dr. Oz Show' host Dr. Mehmet Oz joins Harris Faulkner to discuss the coronavirus outbreak on 'Outnumbered Overtime.' Two more Republican lawmakers -- GOP Reps. Doug Collins of Georgia and Matt Gaetz of Florida -- revealed Monday they had contact with the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) attendee who has since been diagnosed with coronavirus, saying they are not experiencing symptoms but will self-quarantine out of an abundance of caution. Both Collins and Gaetz are pro-Trump Republicans who have been with President Trump since CPAC: Collins shook Trump's hand and joined him for a visit to the CDC in Atlanta on Friday. He also met with Trump at the White House last Tuesday, several days after the Feb. 26-29 conference.       President Donald Trump greets Rep.

Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., steps off Air Force One upon arrival Monday, March 9, 2020, at Andrews Air Force Base, Md. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)       That makes four Republican lawmakers who have said they interacted with the CPAC attendee who tested positive for COVID-19, after announcements over the last day from Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar. Cruz's office released an update on the senator, saying he feels fine: ""Sen. Cruz feels great, has not exhibited any symptoms of the coronavirus in the last 11 days, and is not currently experiencing any symptoms."" CPAC ATTENDEE INTERACTED WITH 'SEVERAL' MEMBERS OF CONGRESS: CAPITOL PHYSICIAN Collins said Monday it was a photograph that led CPAC to determine his interaction with the sick attendee. “This afternoon, I was notified by CPAC that they discovered a photo of myself and the patient who has tested positive for coronavirus,” Collins said in a statement Monday. “While I feel completely healthy and I am not experiencing any symptoms, I have decided to self-quarantine at my home for the remainder of the 14-day period out of an abundance of caution.” He added: “I will follow the recommendations of the House Physician and my office will provide updates as appropriate.” Gaetz's office said he planned to close his Washington office as he awaited test results. ""Congressman Gaetz was informed today that he came into contact with a CPAC attendee 11 days ago who tested positive for COVID-19,"" read a tweet from the congressman's account, adding that ""while the Congressman is not experiencing symptoms, he received testing today and expects results soon."" ""Under doctor's usual precautionary recommendations, he'll remain self-quarantined until the 14-day period expires this week,"" Gaetz's account said. The attending physician for the U.S. Capitol acknowledged Monday that the patient had contact with “several” members of Congress at CPAC. In a statement Monday, Dr. Brian Monahan said that the individual who has been diagnosed with coronavirus was “able to recall specific names of people he had contact with during the meeting.” TRUMP DOWNPLAYS CORONAVIRUS THREAT, NOTES 'COMMON FLU' KILLS THOUSANDS EVERY YEAR Three senior members of Gosar’s staff are also self-quarantined, the lawmaker said. Last week, Gaetz got attention for wearing a gas mask on the House floor and in the Capitol building. The White House was made aware of the CPAC attendee’s diagnosis, as both Trump and Vice President Pence attended and spoke at the conference which took place from Feb. 26 to 29. The White House said there is no indication that Trump or Pence was in close proximity to the stricken attendee. Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, which puts on CPAC, said he had a brief and “incidental contact” with the patient. He is also self-quarantined at this time, despite feeling no symptoms. Despite not having contact with the individual, Trump did come into contact with Schlapp. Meanwhile, Trump downplayed the threat of coronavirus on Monday, noting that the “common flu” kills thousands of Americans each year and that “life & the economy go on.” “So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year,” Trump tweeted Monday. ""Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus with 22 deaths. Think about that!” According to the CDC, during the 2018-2019 flu season in the U.S., an estimated 35.5 million people were sick with influenza and approximately 34,200 people died from the illness.

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow were expected to make the request of Senate Republicans on Tuesday afternoon. The markets appeared to react positively to Trump's announcement, with futures on all three major indices surging by more than two percent. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE The president, who was joined in the White House briefing room by Vice President Mike Pence and the rest of the coronavirus task force, praised his administration’s work in combatting the virus – including prohibiting entry into the U.S. from certain countries and coordinating with state governors – and reiterated that the spread of the virus was not caused by mismanagement within Washington. “This is not our country’s fault, this was something that was thrown at us,” Trump said. “The main thing is we’re taking care of the American public.” Before his press conference, Trump met Mnuchin, Kudlow and other aides about a range of economic actions he could take. He also invited Wall Street executives to the White House on Wednesday to discuss the economic fallout of the epidemic. Kudlow told reporters Friday that the administration is not looking at a “massive” federal relief plan. Rather, any federal aid package would be “timely and targeted and micro.” Lawmakers on Capitol Hill had barely started to contemplate the economic implications of the spread of the virus and what might be needed to stimulate the economy as people cancel vacations and business trips and stay away from stores. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, told reporters that “everything’s on the table."" But members of the Senate Republican leadership, including Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, played down the need for an economic stimulus package of any kind, be it tax cuts or aid for workers. “It’s premature to be talking about that,” Cornyn told reporters. “I usually love tax cuts but I think it’s a little premature.” CORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN Democrats have indicated they preferred other responses, like passing legislation requiring employers to give their workers paid sick leave — a longtime policy priority of Democrats — and additional help for those with lower incomes. Pence, who is heading the task force combatting the outbreak of coronavirus, noted once again that the chances of Americans contracting the virus remain low – and of becoming seriously ill even lower – but warned that the precautions outlined by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) should still be followed. While intent on projecting calm, Trump earlier in the day lashed out about the plunging stock market and convened a meeting of his top economic advisers to address what to do about it. Meanwhile, the number of Republican lawmakers who announced they were isolating themselves because of possible exposure to the virus grew to five. As Trump grappled with an epidemic whose consequences he has repeatedly played down, the White House asserted it was conducting “business as usual.” But the day's business was anything but normal. Lawmakers pressed for details on how the Capitol could be made secure, a Pentagon meeting was broken into sub-groups to minimize the number of people in the same room and the Army commander in Europe placed himself in a precautionary quarantine. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The president dove into handshakes with supporters Monday morning when arriving to headline a fundraiser in Longwood, Fla., that raised approximately $4 million for his reelection campaign and the Republican Party. He ignored shouted questions about the sinking stock market as he boarded Air Force One for the flight back to Washington. On that flight was Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who later went into a voluntary quarantine. He was one of several GOP lawmakers who were exposed to a person at last month's Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) who later tested positive for the virus. Trump did not respond to shouted questions by reporters if he had been tested for the coronavirus following his flight with Gaetz. Pence said he did not know if the president had been tested but told reporters he had not himself received a test for the virus. Late Monday evening, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham issued a statement saying that Trump had not received testing for coronavirus because ""he has neither had prolonged close contact with any known confirmed COVID-19 patients, nor does he have any symptoms"" ""President Trump remains in excellent health, and his physician will continue to closely monitor him,"" Grisham said. On Monday, Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., and Gaetz put themselves in voluntary quarantine because of their contacts with the infected person at CPAC. Both said they did not have any symptoms but would wait out the remainder of the 14 days since the contact at home. Gaetz last week wore a gas mask to the House vote on the emergency funding bill for the virus response and said he wanted to highlight how Congress could become a “petri dish” for the virus. Collins met Trump on Tuesday night at the White House and shook hands with him Friday when the president visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Atlanta headquarters. “The president of the United States, as we all know, is quite a hand-washer,"" press secretary Stephanie Grisham told Fox News earlier Monday. ""He uses hand sanitizer all the time. So he's not concerned about this at all.” The Associated Press contributed to this report.    "

The U.S.-Taliban deal signed on Feb. 29 was touted as Washington’s effort to end 18 years of war in Afghanistan. The next crucial step was to be intra-Afghan talks in which all factions including the Taliban would negotiate a road map for their country’s future. But Ghani and his main political rival, Abdullah Abdullah, were each sworn in as president in separate ceremonies on Monday. Abdallah and the elections complaints commission had charged fraud in last year’s vote. The dueling inaugurations have thrown plans for talks with the Taliban into chaos, although Ghani said Tuesday that he’d start putting together a negotiating team. GET THE FOX NEWS APP The disarray on the Afghan government side is indicative of the uphill task facing Washington’s peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad as he tries to get Afghanistan’s bickering leadership to come together.

Underscoring what’s at stake for his White House bid when Michigan and five other states hold Democratic presidential nomination contests on Tuesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders emphasizes that “this is a very, very important day in Michigan.” Speaking in front of more than 10,000 people at a rally at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, the populist senator from Vermont on Sunday spotlighted that Michigan’s “the most important state” to hold a contest on March 10, which is being dubbed ‘mini Super Tuesday’ or ‘Super Tuesday 2.0.’       Democratic presidential candidate U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., speaks during a campaign rally at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Mich., Sunday, March 8, 2020. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya)       MARCH 10 PRIMARY PRIMER: THE STATES AND THE STAKES With 125 pledged delegates at stake, Michigan is the biggest prize among the six states holding contests on Tuesday. The others are Missouri, Mississippi, Washington state, Idaho and North Dakota. Sanders, a populist senator who’s making his second-straight presidential run, defeated eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016's primary in Michigan, in what was considered a major upset victory. That foreshadowed Clinton’s narrow loss to Donald Trump in the November 2016 general election in Michigan. Trump’s victory with working-class white voters in the state, as well as similar narrow wins in two other crucial Rust Belt states – Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – propelled him to the White House. The pre-Michigan primary polls in 2016 got it all wrong – as they indicated Clinton with a double-digit lead over Sanders. “The 2016 Michigan Democratic primary is considered to be the biggest polling miss of that cycle. Polls released in the week before the state primary showed Hillary Clinton with anywhere from a 10 to 27 point lead,"" noted Monmouth University pollster Patrick Murray. Fast forward four years and former Vice President Joe Biden’s now the clear front-runner in Michigan with the final polls released on primary eve indicating the former vice president with a double-digit lead over Sanders. But Sanders is holding out hope for a repeat performance that would stave off elimination and instead boost the senator back into a massive battle with Biden for the nomination. An optimistic Sanders predicted on Fox News Sunday “I think we're gonna do well on Tuesday, and we're gonna beat Biden.”  While a loss would be considered a setback, Sanders doesn’t see such a prospect as fatal. “I certainly would not consider dropping out,” he stressed. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 20S0 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN  Sanders was the front-runner for the Democratic nomination after winning the Feb. 11 New Hampshire primary and then shellacking the field a week and a half later at the Nevada caucuses. But thanks to his landslide victory in South Carolina a week and a half ago – and a strong performance during last week’s Super Tuesday when he swept 10 of the 14 states holding primaries on Super Tuesday and took the lead over Sanders in the all-important race for Democratic nomination convention delegates – Biden’s moved closer to locking up the nomination. Because of its general election political symbolism and the large delegate cache, Michigan’s capturing the lion’s share of media attention among this week’s round of contests. Biden - very cognizant of the polling debacle in 2016 – stressed on Monday that “I’m kind of superstitious, I see all these polls...I remember Hillary was up by 23 points...I don’t take anything for granted.” Biden, with an eye on November’s general election, emphasized during a rally Monday in Flint that “Michigan is an important contest not just for the Democratic primary, because the outcome of Michigan in November may determine who the next person United States is going to be.” The former vice president’s enjoyed a tidal wave of endorsements from current and former members of Congress and governors the past 10 days - as the party establishment and other moderates all coalesced around Biden to prevent Sanders – a self-described democratic socialist – from becoming the party’s standard-bearer in November’s general election. And many of his former rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination have endorsed his White House bid. Two of those one-time rivals – Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California – joined Biden on the campaign trail in Michigan on Monday after backing him just in the past 24 hours. Sanders, fighting for survival, has increased his jabs at Biden in the wake of Super Tuesday. At a Fox News town hall on primary eve in Detroit, Sanders charged that Biden had ""bailed out the crooks on Wall Street who nearly destroyed our economy 12 years ago."" But he failed to mention that $700 billion rescue plan also had the support of then-presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain. A day earlier in Ann Arbor, Sanders slammed the former vice president  - saying “here we are a few days before a major primary here in Michigan. And we are taking on, in this campaign, not just Joe Biden….We're taking on the 60 billionaires who are funding his campaign. Biden, in a much more comfortable position, has refrained from blasting Sanders. Instead, on Monday he gently jabbed his rival, saying “we’re not looking for a revolution.” The push for a political revolution has long been a staple of Sanders stump speech. But the former vice president’s aiming for what he hopes will a be a near knockout punch to Sanders. Democratic strategist Michael Ceraso – a veteran of the 2016 Sanders campaign and the 2020 White House bid by former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg – stressed that a Biden victory in Michigan coupled with likely wins in Missouri and Mississippi will “put a huge hurdle in front of Sanders to get the delegates he needs to win.”    "

Trump and Vice President Mike Pence spoke at CPAC, but the White House said there was no indication that either had met or been in “close proximity” to the infected attendee.

Aides on Capitol Hill are anxious over what they consider to be a muddled response from both their bosses and the White House to the coronavirus outbreak. Lawmakers in both chambers have been fielding questions from members and staff about how Capitol Hill will be secured, but congressional leaders have so far shown little willingness to close the Capitol building, despite meetings being scheduled throughout the day to discuss preparations. “The chiefs of staff are in a panic,” one longtime aide told Fox News when speaking about coronavirus.  CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE The hesitancy to close Congress could be due in part to fears of how it would affect the already shaky stock market, which plunged to its lowest point since the 2008 financial crisis on Monday.  If Congress were to close up in the midst of the virus outbreak, a number of issues would need to be dealt with, including finding thousands of laptops for aides and members to use when working from home. Fox News is told that congressional work must be performed on congressionally issued computers or devices. The question of how Congress will operate also comes as a number of lawmakers have self-quarantined themselves after being in contact with someone exposed to the virus.  On Sunday, two members of Congress, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., said they are isolating themselves after determining they had contact with the person at the Conservative Political Action Conference nearly two weeks ago. Cruz said Sunday he had brief contact with the man and would spend the next few days at his home in Texas until a full 14 days had passed since their interaction. Gosar said that he had also made contact with the man at CPAC and that he and three members of his senior staff were under self-quarantine. His office will be closed for the week, he said in a tweet Sunday. President Trump also attended the CPAC conference. Besides Cruz and Gosar, the CPAC schedule listed three other senators and 12 House members as speakers. They included House Minority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, House Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney of Wyoming and congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina, who has since become the White House chief of staff. Also on the schedule was Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. A spokesman for Cheney said she has been told by CPAC that she was not exposed to the convention attendee who has tested positive for the coronavirus. GET THE FOX NEWS APP Both Trump and Vice President Mike Pence spoke at CPAC, but the White House said there was no indication that either had met or been in “close proximity” to the infected attendee. Two more Republican lawmakers -- GOP Reps. Doug Collins of Georgia and Matt Gaetz of Florida -- revealed Monday they had contact with the CPAC attendee who has since been diagnosed with coronavirus, saying they are not experiencing symptoms but will self-quarantine out of an abundance of caution. Both Collins and Gaetz are pro-Trump Republicans who have been with Trump since CPAC: Collins shook Trump's hand and joined him for a visit to the CDC in Atlanta on Friday. He also met with Trump at the White House last Tuesday, several days after the Feb. 26-29 conference. Gaetz was spotted riding on Air Force One on Monday as he learned the news.

EXCLUSIVE: The Trump campaign has sent a scathing letter to Twitter's leadership after the platform took the unprecedented step of labeling one of its videos ""manipulated media,"" saying that under the social media giant's new standard, Joe Biden's team has uploaded its own ""doctored and deceptively edited"" video as recently as last week. “The Biden campaign is scared as hell that voters will see the flood of unedited and embarrassing verbal stumbles that will continue go viral if ‘Status Quo Joe’ is the nominee,"" Trump campaign rapid response director Andrew Clark told Fox News. ""Twitter shouldn’t be an enforcement arm of Joe Biden’s campaign strategy, but if they choose to police every video clip they must hold his own campaign to the same standard.” The confrontation began this the weekend when Trump communications director Dan Scavino tweeted an edited version of a Biden speech in which the former vice president appears to deliver a muddled and inadvertent endorsement of Trump. Scavino's clip, which the president later reposted, did not alter any of Biden's words, but it cut off before the conclusion of Biden's sentence at a rally in St. Louis. Conservatives called the video an obvious attempt to highlight Biden's verbal gaffes, and argued that no one would reasonably mistake it for a genuine Biden endorsement. ""Understandably, the Biden campaign has a strategic interest in intimidating social media companies into suppressing true and embarrassing video evidence of Joe Biden’s continued inability to communicate coherently—a sad truth that has been publicly noted by Democrats and media figures alike,"" Trump campaign chief operating officer Michael Glassner wrote in the missive to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, general counsel Vijaya Gadde, and public policy director Carlos Monje. ""Still, it appears that many people employed by Big Tech corporations in Silicon Valley are assisting the Biden campaign by instituting a special ‘Biden protection rule’ that effectively censors and silences legitimate political speech Biden’s campaign and its supporters do not like,"" he added in the letter, obtained by Fox News. Glassner said he was ""formally requesting that Twitter apply its new 'manipulated media' label to a doctored and deceptively edited video tweeted by the Biden campaign less than a week ago."" That was a reference to a March 3 video uploaded by the Biden campaign that contains a slew of clips that are taken out of context, and ""manipulates audio and video of President Trump in order to mislead Americans and give a false impression,"" Glassner wrote. The video, Glassner points out, contains two clips ""spliced together to fabricate a quote and give viewers the false impression that he called the coronavirus a 'hoax,'"" a claim that the non-partisan International Fact-Checking Network has previously debunked. The president in fact called Democrats' response to the coronavirus ""their new hoax."" Additionally, the Biden video effectively repeats a false claim the former vice president himself made in his campaign launch video, asserting through selective editing that the president called white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va. ""very fine people."" That assertion, although widely made in progressive circles, is untrue; the president was referring to protesters on both sides of the issue of whether Confederate statues should be removed from public places as ""very fine people."" ""In fact, 49 seconds after President Trump said those words, he said, 'and I’m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally,'"" Glassner wrote. ""As one CNN anchor said, 'he’s not saying that the neo-Nazis and white supremacists are very fine people[.]'"". ""If Twitter is not seeking to protect Joe Biden, we urge it to correct its apparent oversight and apply its standards equally across the board."" Third, the Biden video contains a 2016 clip in which then-candidate Trump declares ""the American Dream is dead"" -- but leaves out the second part of Trump's sentence, in which he says, ""but if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.” READ THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN'S LETTER TO TWITTER CEO ""Of course, this is not the first time the Biden campaign has used editing tricks to manipulate video and feed misinformation to the American people,"" Glassner wrote. ""If Twitter is not seeking to protect Joe Biden, we urge it to correct its apparent oversight and apply its standards equally across the board."" Fox News has identified several other videos posted to Biden's Twitter account that contain similar misleading clips. An October 2019 post on Biden's campaign account, for example, states that Trump ""has asked foreign governments to interfere in our elections,"" and is accompanied by a video of a White House interview that omits Trump's full remarks. In the full interview, Trump says, ""I think maybe you do both,"" referring to notifying the FBI as well as listening to an offer of political help from a foreign entity; but in the Biden clip, Trump says only that he would ""listen"" to the proposal from a foreign entity. Glassner made clear that the Trump campaign was not backing off its original video of Biden, saying the clip was ""a 100 percent real, 100 percent authentic, 100 percent unedited video of Joe Biden saying, 'We cannot win this re-election. Excuse me. We can only re-elect Donald Trump[.]'"" TRUMP EMBRACES MUDDLED BIDEN 'ENDORSEMENT,' AS COMPETENCY CONCERNS MOUNT In order for American elections to remain ""free and fair,"" Glassner wrote, ""it is critical that the Biden campaign be held to the same standard it is demanding apply to others."" In the post uploaded by Scavino, Biden seemingly endorses the president after stammering over some words. ""Turn this primary from a campaign that's about negative attacks into one about what we're for, because we cannot get -- re-elect -- we cannot win this re-election -- excuse me. We can only re-elect Donald Trump,"" Biden says in the edited clip. In the full speech, Biden went on to add,"" -- if, in fact, we get engaged in this circular firing squad here. Gotta be a positive campaign, so join us."" Twitter quickly labeled the tweet ""misinformation,"" in the social media giant's first-ever use of its new policy, which is ostensibly designed to combat the spread of false news. The so-called Synthetic and Manipulated Media policy states that ""you may not deceptively share synthetic or manipulated media that are likely to cause harm."" The policy went into effect Mar. 5 after a campaign video from Mike Bloomberg's team added crickets and a long silence when Bloomberg asked his rivals if any of them had started a business. Facebook has said that the Trump video would not meet its platform for deceptive editing. Currently, no misinformation flag appears on the video for some users when it is directly clicked, although a warning does appear if the video shows up in a user's feed. Twitter has said it is working to apply the warning whenever the clip is accessed. BILLIONAIRE REPUBLICAN BUYS MAJOR STAKE IN TWITTER, COULD OUST CEO SOON The broader issue of Biden's potential competency issues looms large over the 2020 presidential race. Also in St. Louis, Biden bizarrely described himself as an ""O'Biden Bama"" Democrat, transposing his name and the name of his old boss. Trump suggested at a Fox News Town Hall last week that Biden isn't fit for office. ""I'm all set for Bernie, communist,"" Trump began. ""And then we have this crazy thing that happened on Tuesday, which he [Biden] thought was Thursday. But he also said 150 million people were killed with guns, and that he was running for the U.S. Senate -- there's something going on there.""    "

A Georgia woman pardoned by President Trump announced last week that she will run as a Republican against longtime Democratic Rep. John Lewis. Angela Stanton-King was pardoned last month for her 2004 conviction in a vehicle-theft ring for which she served six months in home confinement and has since become a best-selling author and television personality. In a tweet announcing her congressional bid, she said it wasn't about replacing Lewis but instead ""about picking up the torch and continuing the fight for Justice."" Lewis, a civil rights icon who has served over 30 years in Congress, announced in December that he was battling pancreatic cancer. ""I'm honored to be running for my 18th term in Congress representing the citizens of Georgia's 5th district,"" Lewis said in a statement to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""My constituents know me, they know my record, and they know that I have fought tirelessly for them for the last 33 years,” Stanton-King said abortion will be her campaign's top issue, in addition to criminal justice and helping black prison inmates re-enter society, the newspaper reported. “Whenever I think about Rep. John Lewis, the image I have in my head is him on the Selma bridge,"" she said, referring to the congressman’s role during the 1965 march on Alabama’s Edmund Pettus Bridge. ""I have the utmost respect for the contributions that he has made to black America,"" she added. ""However, this isn’t the Selma bridge, and our babies are dying. It is time for war.” Stanton-King is the goddaughter of Alveda King, niece of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and ally of President Trump.

I found myself thinking over the weekend that with Joe Biden now favored to win the nomination, it won’t be long before the press starts the quadrennial veepstakes ritual. And yesterday—boom!—it arrived in spades. The coronavirus may be spreading worldwide, Wall Street may be having a bloodbath, and Biden has yet to beat Bernie Sanders in Michigan and other key states. But nothing stops the VP speculation. GENDER QUESTIONS SWIRL AS WARREN LEAVES RACE TO TWO OLD MEN There’s an added twist this year, which is the widespread expectation—and, in some quarters, demand—that the Democratic running mate will be a woman. As the New York Times put it, “prominent Democrats began publicly insisting that the ticket include a woman, preferably a black woman.” There is a pressure campaign, to be sure, but it also makes good political sense for a 77-year-old nominee to pick someone who can take over the presidency—and, in a year when four women were knocked out of the race, to choose someone of a different gender. “There must be a woman on this ticket,” Cecile Richards, the longtime abortion rights activist who helped found Supermajority, told the paper. I guess that’s what activists do. Given that there have been exactly two female VP nominees—Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 and Sarah Palin in 2008—a woman who actually won the vice presidency would be a definite milestone, even if Elizabeth Warren supporters are still fuming about alleged sexism. Needless to say, a woman at that level of the White House would also be a strong contender to succeed a septuagenarian president, who might serve only one term. (Sanders also says he’ll consider a woman if he wins the nomination fight.) The Times, turning it on the president, says “such a choice could generate enthusiasm from female voters who make up the backbone of the party and sharpen their contrast with Mr. Trump, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by nearly a dozen women.” Now comes the inevitable journalistic parlor game: Who? SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES Washington Post Editorial Page Editor Fred Hiatt says the search should start with Warren, Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand, “who gained stature and name recognition” during the campaign. The problem: “They all lost, and they all had time to rub at least some voters the wrong way.” I’m not sure Warren is a great pick because she’s 70 (not much of a youth movement there) and so much more progressive (she backs Medicare-for-All, which Biden has denounced). Harris might seem like a long shot after she eviscerated Biden on the debate stage over busing in the 1970s. But the former VP is said to like her because she was friendly with his late son Beau. Hiatt then floats such governors as Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island and Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico, as well as Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer, his new national co-chair. He throws in some mayors as well. My take: If Biden selects someone who most of America has never heard of, he starts out behind. The media vetting of whether that person is qualified to assume the presidency would start from scratch, and all kinds of things pop up. That hurt John McCain when he picked the relatively inexperienced Sarah Palin in 2008, and makes the choice a wild card. The Week does some handicapping: Warren “would help excite women — above all highly educated professional women,” but that she “dramatically underperformed” in the campaign. Klobuchar would “bolster Biden’s moderate bona fides,” but “failed to generate much enthusiasm among voters.” Harris “exudes energy and compassion” and having a woman of color would be a plus. As for Stacey Abrams, she’s not ready for prime time “as an author, voting-rights activist, former Georgia state representative, failed candidate for governor, and a celebrity of sorts among woke progressives and academics.” In the end, running mates don’t matter all that much. Donald Trump didn’t win because of Mike Pence, Hillary Clinton didn’t lose because of Tim Kaine, and Barack Obama didn’t win because of Biden. But given Biden’s age and the Democratic hunger for a woman on the ticket, whoever gets the nod might matter more this year than in the recent past. Footnote: Axios goes further with Biden’s “secret governing plan”: basically an assortment of names being floated for top jobs. They include John Kerry, Susan Rice, Mike Bloomberg, Jamie Dimon, Warren and Pete Buttigieg. But one you can basically count on: If Biden wins, adviser Ron Klain, his chief of staff as VP—and the Obama czar for the Ebola outbreak—will be White House chief of staff.    "

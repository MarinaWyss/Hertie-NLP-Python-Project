"WASHINGTON (AP) — A quirk in how delegates are won under Democratic Party rules is raising the stakes for Tuesday’s elections, allowing a candidate to make up ground in the race quickly — or fall further behind. Five states — Michigan, Washington, Missouri, Mississippi and Idaho — hold Democratic primaries on Tuesday, while North Dakota has a caucus. All told, there are 352 delegates up for grabs. A candidate needs 1,991 delegates to win the Democratic presidential nomination. That makes for only the fourth-largest delegate night on the primary calendar. But the intricate arithmetic of how delegates are won under Democrats’ rules makes it possible for a candidate to reap a bigger haul of delegates with a smaller margin of victory on this Tuesday than on any other night. For Bernie Sanders, it’s an opportunity to catch up to Joe Biden, who enters the day ahead by 96 delegates. For Biden, it’s a chance to open up what could become an insurmountable lead. How this happens may seem complicated, but it’s nothing more than some basic math and an “odd” quirk of how delegates are won under party rules. Most delegates awarded Tuesday — 65% — will be won based on how the candidates perform in individual congressional districts. Think of each district as holding a bucket of delegates. There are also two buckets of delegates in each state awarded based on the overall statewide vote. On Tuesday, that makes for 51 buckets of delegates across the six states. A candidate needs to win at least 15% of the overall vote in a bucket to be “viable” — or to qualify to win delegates. (That 15% threshold means it’s all but assured that only Biden and Sanders win any delegates from this point forward.) First, the math. Party rules say each viable candidate wins a proportion of the delegates in each bucket based on his share of the votes cast for the viable candidates in that bucket. Second, the quirk. Buckets that have an odd number of delegates are impossible to split evenly, meaning either Sanders or Biden is guaranteed to win at least one more than the other. Say, for example, there are seven delegates in a bucket, and Sanders gets 51% and Biden gets 49% of the viable votes. In delegates, that’s 3.57 to 3.43 — a difference of just 0.14 delegates. But thanks to rounding, Sanders gets four and Biden gets three. Nearly two-thirds of the 352 delegates at stake on Tuesday are in buckets with an odd number of delegates — more than on any other night with more than one primary. Democratic National Committee member Elaine Kamarck, who was Walter Mondale’s delegate hunter during his campaign for president in 1984, said it’s “odd” how the odd-even districts work out, but it all adds up to whoever does best on Tuesday waking up Wednesday with “a comfortable haul.” But wait: It gets better — or worse, if you’re the candidate who ends up behind. After the primaries on March 17, most of the delegates to be won come from buckets with an even number of delegates. Why does that matter? It means Biden or Sanders will need to win far more than 50% of the vote in a bucket to win more delegates than his rival. From a bucket holding six delegates, a candidate needs more than 58.3% to win four delegates. In a district with eight delegates, the leader needs 56.3% to get five. Put another way, a candidate could keep coming in second in the overall vote, but so long as he keeps the race relatively close, he’ll still end up with the same number of delegates in an “even” bucket as the candidate who finishes first. And that means whoever does best on Tuesday, and next week when Arizona, Florida, Ohio and Illinois get their turn, could end up with a delegate lead that can’t be beat. “It’s just funny how the numbers just work out,” Kamarck said Monday, and that means Tuesday night is “a big deal.” ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.”",'Odd' quirk raises delegate stakes in Tuesday's elections,2020-03-10T04:15:12Z,https://apnews.com/8d90a37e5e5b177d08424fd14a24ffe6,AP
"DETROIT (AP) — Bernie Sanders proved his 2016 presidential bid was serious with an upset victory in Michigan powered by his opposition to free trade and appeal among working-class voters. Four years later, the same state could either revive the Vermont senator’s campaign or relegate him to the role of protest candidate. Michigan and five other states hold presidential contests on Tuesday at a critical point in the Democratic race.  Former Vice President Joe Biden is looking to quash Sanders’ hopes and cement his own front-runner status just a week after resurrecting his beleaguered White House bid with a delegate victory on Super Tuesday. He played up his underdog story on Monday as he campaigned across Michigan, reflecting on his stutter as a child and the deaths of his first wife and young daughter.  And Biden wasn’t alone. The former vice president courted the state’s influential African American voters alongside the two most prominent black candidates previously in the 2020 race, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, who endorsed Biden in recent days as part of a broader consolidation of support among party leaders. Sanders is in an urgent fight to turn things around as the primary calendar quickly shifts to other states that could favor Biden and narrow his path to the nomination. The senator countered the parade of Democratic firepower lining up behind Biden by securing the endorsement of the Rev. Jesse Jackson and deploying Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., on his behalf. Having devoted several days to Michigan, the Vermont senator spent the eve of Tuesday’s primaries in Missouri, where he downplayed questions about electability and insisted that the “energy and excitement” of his supporters made him the strongest Democrat to run against President Donald Trump this fall.  Tuesday marks the first time voters will weigh in on the Democratic contest since it effectively narrowed to a two-person race between Sanders and Biden. It will be another test of whether Sanders can broaden his appeal among African Americans. Biden, meanwhile, must show that he can keep momentum going after his surprise Super Tuesday turnaround.  “I like his chances,” Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who has endorsed Biden, said of the former vice president in an interview. “He knows Michigan,” Whitmer added. “When our back was up against the wall during the auto struggles of the past, it was Barack Obama and Joe Biden who had our backs.” That’s a reference to the Obama administration overseeing federal bailouts that helped the auto industry — the lifeblood of Michigan’s economy — weather the 2009 financial crisis. Sanders counters that he, too, voted to save the auto industry. He also says that, unlike Biden, he opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he said prompted thousands of Michigan jobs to move to Mexico since taking effect in 1994. Biden ticked off the names of six former presidential rivals who have endorsed him just in the past week during a Monday appearance with Booker in Flint, Michigan, a community that has seen auto industry jobs disappear: “They’ve all come out and endorsed at one time ... the candidate that they think can win.” And later in Detroit, he stood on stage grasping hands with Whitmer, Booker and Harris, a powerful trio of potential vice presidential picks should Biden become the Democrats’ presidential nominee.  The large rally was interrupted repeatedly by protesters, however, who railed against Biden’s support for the North American Free Trade Agreement and his reluctance to embrace sweeping environmental proposals outlined in the so-called Green New Deal.  In a scuffle with environmental protesters in the midst of Biden’s remarks, senior adviser Symone Sanders was knocked to the ground. She was not hurt. Less than a week ago she tackled a protester who rushed the stage as Biden spoke in California. Other economic challenges emerged on Monday as fears about the spread of the new coronavirus shook financial markets, slicing 7.8% from the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Sanders held a roundtable with health experts in Detroit, and Biden said he would defer to health experts about whether campaign events could continue, given concerns about the spread of the virus. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert, stopped short of calling on candidates to put a pause on political rallies. Instead, he said he wouldn’t criticize someone seeking office for putting a pause on big gatherings. “If you’re talking about a campaign rally tomorrow in a place where there is no community spread, I think the judgment to have it might be a good judgment,” Fauci said Monday at a White House briefing. “If you want to talk about large gatherings in a place where you have community spread, I think that’s a judgment call.” An outstanding question going into Tuesday is whether Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who dropped out of the race last week, will endorse Biden or Sanders. So far, she’s declined to back either, an especially frustrating development for Sanders, who could use Warren’s help in unifying progressives in much the same way Biden has been able to rally moderates. Sanders has scoffed at suggestions he could drop out if he doesn’t win Michigan, but his travel schedule underscores its importance. He canceled a trip to Mississippi and instead made five campaign stops across Michigan since Friday.  Sanders won’t say if he’s personally lobbying Warren for her endorsement. He did manage to secure the backing of Jackson, who said it was no time for centrist compromise.  He jabbed Biden during a Monday appearance in downtown St. Louis, reminding a largely young crowd of the former vice president’s long record in Washington. Sanders noted that unlike Biden, he opposed the war in Iraq, Wall Street bailouts after the 2008 collapse and any talk of cuts to Social Security. “In a general election, which candidate can generate the enthusiasm and the excitement and the voter turnout we need?” Sanders asked. “If you want to defeat Trump, which all Democrats do and the majority of independents do and some Republicans do, we are that campaign.”  One of Sanders’ highest-profile supporters, Ocasio-Cortez, struck a far more conciliatory tone the day before addressing 10,000-plus on the campus of the University of Michigan on Sunday night, saying, “In order for us to win, we have to grow.”  “We must be inclusive. We must bring more people into this movement,” she said, urging Sanders supporters to shed “cynicism and exclusion” and “turn with an embracing posture, where all people are welcome in a people’s movement.”  Sanders is optimistic about Washington state on Tuesday, but could face hurdles in Mississippi and Missouri. Sanders’ team acknowledges he will also struggle in next week’s Florida primary, where the senator’s past defense of Fidel Castro looms large. He also could face long odds in Ohio and Illinois — especially if he underperforms in Michigan. Both of those states also vote March 17. The wild card next week could be Arizona, where Sanders will be counting on strong Latino support, which lifted him to victory in California.  Sanders advisers are aware that Biden could build an insurmountable delegate lead if he runs up the score in the upcoming contests. They hope to continue doing well in the West before picking up momentum in places like delegate-rich New York, which holds its primary next month.  There’s no guarantee Sanders could last that long this time, however, given the higher expectations he now faces. Even some of those attending Sanders rallies are beginning to feel it, although his St. Louis audience was optimistic. Alec McAulay, a 19-year-old college student from St. Louis County, said Sanders has proved that he’s a true alternative to the president.  “I think Biden agrees with Trump too much, more than any Democrat should,” McAulay said.  ___ Associated Press writers Seth Borenstein in Washington and Steve Peoples in Flint, Mich., contributed to this report. ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.”",Michigan primary could make or break Sanders' campaign,2020-03-10T04:35:05Z,https://apnews.com/5b4fa2256d232ca24b2f93fff3131e99,AP
"NEW YORK (AP) — One of President Donald Trump’s first impulses in response to the outbreak of the coronavirus in China was to suggest it was a buying opportunity in the U.S. stock market. Even as the global peril of the virus has escalated, Trump has leaned hard on his decades of experience as a businessman, keeping his focus on the economy and financial markets and urging people to continue traveling and patronizing U.S. businesses.  “You know, a lot of people are staying here and they’re going to be doing their business here,” he said Friday, as stocks fell again and the tally of infected in the U.S. climbed. “They’re going to be traveling here. And they’ll be going to resorts here.”  And possibly to the president’s own resorts. The virus provides the latest example of how the president’s public and personal interests are interwoven, but this time driven by a crisis with major global health implications in addition to financial ones. “If there is any public health shutdown of restaurants, conventions and meetings, that will impact his property and his finances,” said Kathleen Clark, an ethics lawyer at Washington University School of Law in St. Louis and frequent critic of the president. “I think a reasonable person can conclude that he is motivated by personal interests.” All of Trump’s properties, at home and abroad, would stand to suffer if travel and tourism business continues to evaporate. A business travel group is estimating revenue losses globally of nearly $50 billion per month. Trump’s comments Friday are the latest rosy depiction of the crisis as he has tried to brush past the economic impact. No president has more closely tied his political fortunes to the stock market, and a slowdown in the nation’s economy could imperil his reelection hopes. Trump has peppered his economic advisers with questions about the virus’ impact and has boasted about the strength of the economy. “We have a great economy. We have a very strong economy,” Trump insisting during an appearance Monday in the White House briefing room. Though a self-proclaimed firewall exists between Trump and the company that bears his name, the president has been known to ask his business associates, and namely his adult sons now its titular heads, how his properties are faring, according to two Republicans close to the White House not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations. And in recent days, Trump was slow to embrace federal recommendations against the elderly boarding airplanes or passengers traveling on cruise ships. The White House did not respond to a request for comment as to whether the president’s handling of the epidemic was informed by the impact it could have on his properties.  Noah Bookbinder, executive director of the watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said that he isn’t sure the president is thinking of his properties right now. But in deciding to not sell his business before taking office, Bookbinder said, the president has raised doubts about his motives and that in itself is damaging.  “We have to ask with almost every major policy decision whether he’s acting in the country’s interest or his own interest,” Bookbinder said. “In a time of crisis like this, being able to trust our institutions, that our government is making the right decision for our health, economy and security is incredibly important.” For now, the privately held Trump Organization doesn’t appear to have taken a blow.  As the coronavirus panic began to settle in during the first week of March, the high-vaulted lobby of his hotel in Washington and its bar remained crowded with visitors, including many sporting Trump’s trademark red campaign hats.  Next up, dozens of bankers from Texas who are planning a reception at the hotel on March 22 as part of a four-day visit to the capital. A spokeswoman for the group sponsoring the trip, the Texas Bankers Association, said that none of 81 registered to attend had pulled out yet. “I haven’t seen much of a drop off — if at all,” said Zach Everson, a frequent visitor who writes an online newsletter about the hotel called 1100 Pennsylvania Ave. He added, referring to a recent visit, “It was packed.”  So too was the president’s Mar-a-Largo in Palm Beach, Florida, last weekend. On Sunday, the venue threw a birthday party for Donald Trump Jr.’s girlfriend, and social media posts showed the place was jammed. The day before Trump hosted a dinner for Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Still, the Trump properties can ill afford a downturn in business. The Trump Organization has been struggling from lost business due to a backlash against the president’s rhetoric and his policies. Several buildings licensing his name have stripped it from their facades, major groups have canceled events at his resorts, and his Scottish golf clubs continue to lose millions. Even his Washington hotel, for all its buzz, is showing signs of struggling, as rooms stand empty. The Trump Organization recently put the hotel up for sale. The company did not respond to requests for comment. Trump has long governed with an eye toward increasing profits at his properties.  Since taking office, he has spent hundreds of days at his properties, particularly in Florida and New Jersey, the visits providing valuable promotional material. Moreover, the Trump Organization profits off the federal employees — including White House staff and Secret Service — who then need to stay alongside Trump in Palm Beach or Bedminster, New Jersey, one of 17 Trump golf resorts around the world. Trump has also floated hosting the international G7 at his property outside of Miami, only to relent after being met by howls of protests from Democrats and civic watchdogs. When it comes to Trump’s response to the current crisis and potential conflicts with his vast financial interests, not all ethics expert are bothered. Edwin Williamson, a former State Department legal adviser, said that even if Trump had sold his properties before he took office and put the money into a stock or bond fund, as ethics rules suggest of many federal officials, critics might be raising questions. “Anyone who had a highly diversified funds under the rules would still have the same issue,” said Williamson. “Did you see what the market did today?” The Dow Jones index plunged 7.8 percent Monday, its steepest drop since the 2008 financial crisis. Brian Friedman, owner of the Kimpton Glover Park among other Washington hotels and a bidder on the Trump hotel, said a falling stock market can wallop the front desk because people don’t want to travel as much when they feel less wealthy. Throw in a virus, he said, and Trump, along with everyone else in the business, is going to take a big hit. “I don’t know of any big cancellations. I have not seen the impact yet,” Friedman said. “But I do think it’s going to come.”",Trump talks down virus as his properties face possible hit,2020-03-10T00:05:20Z,https://apnews.com/a5e4261f40050e07ad3b6b9eb04694aa,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — American troops have begun leaving Afghanistan for the initial troop withdrawal required in the U.S.-Taliban peace agreement, the U.S. military confirmed Monday, amid political chaos in Kabul that threatens the deal. Army Col. Sonny Leggett, spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said in a statement that the U.S. is moving ahead with plans to cut the number of forces in the country from about 13,000 to 8,600 over the next four and a half months. Another U.S. official said hundreds of troops have headed out of the country as previously planned, but they will not be replaced. The official spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to discuss the movement ahead of a public announcement. The pullout comes as Afghanistan’s rival leaders were each sworn in as president in separate ceremonies Monday, creating a complication for the United States as it figures out how to move forward on the deal and end the 18-year war. The sharpening dispute between President Ashraf Ghani, who was declared the winner of last September’s election, and his rival Abdullah Abdullah, who charged fraud in the vote along with the elections complaints commission, threatens to wreck the next key steps and even risks devolving into new violence. The U.S. has not tied the withdrawal to political stability in Afghanistan or any specific outcome from the all-Afghan peace talks. Instead, it depends on the Taliban meeting its commitment to prevent “any group or individual, including al-Qaida, from using the soil of Afghanistan to threaten the security of the United States and its allies.”  Under the peace agreement, the U.S. troop withdrawal had to begin within 10 days after the deal was signed on Feb. 29. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said March 2 that he had already approved the start of the withdrawal, which would then be coordinated by military commanders in Afghanistan. The U.S. official said the troops leaving now had been scheduled to depart, but they will not be replaced. Esper has said Gen. Scott Miller, the U.S. commander in Kabul, will pause the withdrawal and assess conditions once the troop level goes down to 8,600.  Leggett said the U.S. military in Afghanistan will maintain “all the military means and authorities to accomplish our objectives, including conducting counterterrorism operations” against al-Qaida and the Islamic State’s affiliate in the country, and will maintain support for Afghan forces.. The long-term plan is for the U.S. to remove all troops within 14 months if security conditions are met. The agreement with the Taliban followed a seven-day “reduction in violence” period that, from the Trump administration’s viewpoint, was meant to test the Taliban’s seriousness about moving toward a final peace agreement.","US begins troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, official says",2020-03-09T16:09:06Z,https://apnews.com/2e8a815a031e8da37075feec466694c2,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump says his administration will ask Congress to pass payroll tax relief and other quick measures as a public health and economic maelstrom brought on by the coronavirus drew closer to him personally. Intending to calm the fears of financial markets over the impact of the epidemic, Trump told reporters Monday he is seeking “very substantial relief” to the payroll tax. Trump also said he was seeking help for hourly-wage workers to ensure they’re “not going to miss a paycheck” and “don’t get penalized for something that’s not their fault.” He stepped forward with the contours of an initiative after markets dropped sharply and as the outbreak spread. Several Trump confidants in Congress disclosed they were isolating themselves after potential exposure to the virus; one traveled with the president from Florida on Air Force One on Monday; another was his just-tapped new chief of staff. Trump said he would hold a press conference Tuesday to outline the proposals, saying his administration and Congress would be “discussing a possible payroll tax cut or relief, substantial relief, very substantial relief, that’s big, that’s a big number. We’re also going to be talking about hourly wage earners getting help so that they can be in a position where they’re not going to ever miss a paycheck.” As Trump grappled with an epidemic whose consequences he has repeatedly played down, the White House asserted it was conducting “business as usual.” But the day’s business was anything but normal. Lawmakers pressed for details on how the Capitol could be made secure, handshakes on the Hill were discouraged and a Pentagon meeting was broken into sub-groups to minimize the number of people in the same room. The president himself dove into handshakes with supporters earlier in the day, when arriving to headline a fundraiser in Longwood, Florida, that raised approximately $4 million for his reelection campaign and the Republican Party.  On his flight back to Washington he was accompanied by Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, who later went into a voluntary quarantine. He was one of several GOP lawmakers who were exposed to a person at last month’s Conservative Political Action Conference who tested positive for the virus. His office said he was “mid-flight” on Air Force One when CPAC informed his staff that he had been in contact with the attendee who had the virus. Once the plane landed, Gaetz was immediately tested. Vice President Mike Pence, who also spoke at CPAC, said he has not been tested for the virus. White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said Trump has not been tested because he has not had “prolonged close contacts” with any patients and “does not have any symptoms.” In Monday morning tweets, Trump vented about the market drop and news that large public gatherings were being called off because of the virus.  “At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths,” Trump tweeted, comparing it to seasonal influenza and the thousands of deaths that causes. “Think about that!”  Scientists at this stage don’t know what the death rate of the new coronavirus actually is and whether it will wind up being about the same as flu or worse. At the same time, administration officials were insistent that they weren’t trying to dismiss public concerns. “This is a very serious health problem,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told Fox News.  At the Pentagon, officials have begun “social distancing” measures.  On Monday, Defense Secretary Mark Esper’s regular meeting with senior staff, which normally would be held face-to-face in a single room with 40 to 50 participants, was broken up into three rooms, with video-teleconferencing among the rooms, according to the Pentagon’s chief spokesman, Jonathan Hoffman. He said Esper and the 15 to 20 people in his room, including Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, sat at least six feet apart, in line with health guidance. Trump was delegating much of the virus response to Pence, who convened a video teleconference to give an update on the federal government’s virus response Monday afternoon with the nation’s governors. Trump met his top economic advisers before emerging to disclose he’ll seek the payroll tax break. The White House has been convening meetings with an array of travel and healthcare industry representatives, and was set to host Wall Street executives at the White House on Wednesday to discuss the economic fallout of the epidemic. Futures in the S&P 500 index, which can indicate how Wall Street will open Tuesday, were up more than 2.5% late Monday after the administration’s news conference. On Capitol Hill, where many lawmakers are older and have frequent contact with the public, leaders were fielding questions from members and staff about how the complex will be secured. Leaders have so far shown little willingness to close the Capitol, but meetings were scheduled throughout the day to discuss preparations.  On Monday, Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., and Gaetz put themselves in voluntary quarantine because of their contacts with someone at the Conservative Political Action Conference.  Both said they did not have any symptoms but would wait out the remainder of the 14 days since the contact at home. Gaetz last week wore a gas mask to the House vote on the emergency funding bill for the virus response and said he wanted to highlight how Congress could become “petri dish” for the virus.  Collins had met with Trump last Tuesday night at the White House and shook hands with him Friday when the president visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Atlanta headquarters. Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., whom Trump named Friday as his incoming chief of staff, also went into self-quarantine. “A precautionary test came back negative & he feels great,” his spokesman tweeted late Monday. Meadows has not yet resigned his congressional seat and has not yet assumed his new role at the White House, but he is a frequent visitor.  Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., also placed themselves in quarantine after coming in contact with the same person at the conservative conference. Rep. Julia Brownley, D-Calif., said she met last week with a person who has since been diagnosed with the virus. She closed her office and said she and her staff are “self-monitoring and maintaining social distancing practices.” Vast numbers of visitors come to the Hill, especially at this time of year when advocacy groups arrange “fly-in” trips to lobby and speak to lawmakers, and school groups descend for tours.  One Republican who said he was informed he had been exposed at the conservative conference, Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas, tweeted that he was cleared to return to Washington. He was spotted leading a Capitol tour for more than 100 visitors late Monday evening. In one manifestation of lawmaking in the age of the coronavirus, Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., approached a Republican colleague on the House floor Monday for a routine congratulatory handshake after the chamber approved a bill expanding a visa program. “Shake or bump?” Neal asked Rep. Kelly Armstrong, R-N.D.  The two men bumped elbows. Offices on Capitol Hill also advertised they were holding “no contact meetings” and asked guests to refrain from shaking hands. The chairman of the Democratic caucus, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, said the House’s chief administrative officer and the sergeant at arms are expected to brief Democrats at their regular caucus meeting Tuesday. The discussion was expected to address whether the Capitol will be restricted to visitors, he said. It was not immediately clear how Trump was aiming to provide assistance to employees weighing whether to stay home because of illness — a crucial aim of public health officials seeking to curtail the spread of the virus. One mechanism, backed by the Trump-allied National Association of Manufacturers, involves a proposed tax credit for employers who pay employees who are quarantined. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Larry Kudlow, the director of the national economic council, were expected to bring the White House proposal to Senate Republicans on Tuesday afternoon, at which point officials planned to release more publicly. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill had barely started to contemplate the economic implications of the spread of the virus and what might be needed to stimulate the economy as people cancel vacations and business trips and stay away from stores. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley told reporters that “everything’s on the table.” But members of the Senate Republican leadership, including Texas Sen. John Cornyn played down the need for an economic stimulus package of any kind, be it tax cuts or aid for workers. “It’s premature to be talking about that,” Cornyn told reporters. “I usually love tax cuts but I think it’s a little premature.” Democrats panned — for now — Trump’s proposed payroll tax cut. They said it was not specific enough to the core problem and are preparing their own package of aid, including affordable testing, unemployment benefits and paid leave for working families affected by the virus. “Unfortunately at the president’s press conference today, he really did not address the coronavirus issue,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, standing alongside Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer after a late meeting at the Capitol. “This is about the kitchen table of America’s working families.” A House vote could come as soon as this week, Pelosi said, but more likely would shift to April.  While they did not completely oppose Trump’s proposed payroll tax cut, they said they prefer their approach as a better way to instill confidence in families and the economy. “Unless you deal with the pandemic the stock market’s going to keep getting worse and worse and worse,” Schumer said. “If there’s going to be relief it ought to be aimed at the families that are most affected.”  A day after saying it was “proceeding as normal,” Trump’s campaign canceled a three-day Women for Trump bus tour across Michigan that included Mercedes Schlapp, the former White House aide who is married to the American Conservative Union chairman, Matt Schlapp.  Schlapp is under self-quarantine after after he, too, was exposed to the infected person at CPAC. He introduced Trump and greeted him with a handshake on stage before the president’s spoke on Feb. 29. ___ Associated Press writers Lauran Neergaard, Andy Taylor, Kevin Freking, Jill Colvin, Bob Burns, Lisa Mascaro and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"The newly formed two-man race for the Democratic presidential nomination debuts Tuesday, a week after Joe Biden benefited from a rapid consolidation of moderate and establishment voters, while Bernie Sanders outlasted Elizabeth Warren as the progressive left’s last hope.  Here are the big questions heading into six primaries that put a combined 352 delegates at stake between Biden and Sanders: CAN SANDERS ACTUALLY CATCH BIDEN? Fresh off Biden’s Super Tuesday surge, when he won 10 out of 14 state contests, the former vice president has 664 delegates to Sanders’ 573, according to Associated Press calculations, with some still to be allocated. Sanders’ deficit isn’t insurmountable, considering 1,991 delegates are needed for the nomination. But the Vermont senator’s hill is steeper than it might look given Democrats use a proportional system to award delegates, not a winner-take-all model like Republicans.  Michigan and Washington, the states with the two largest delegate counts on Tuesday, are critical. Sanders topped Hillary Clinton in both states four years ago, with his Michigan primary win giving him the momentum to carry on through the end of the nominating calendar in June. Even then, he never could catch Clinton. Following Michigan in 2016, Sanders’ single largest net gains came in three caucuses: Idaho (plus-13 for Sanders), Utah (plus-21) and Washington state (plus-47). The bad news for Sanders: Utah switched this year to a Super Tuesday primary, so those delegates already are accounted for. Washington and Idaho hold primaries Tuesday, with a larger, more unpredictable turnout expected than in 2016. Even if Sanders wins in those states, it will be difficult to replicate the margins he managed against Clinton, and the later it gets in the process, the more a second-place candidate must run up the score to catch the delegate leader. As former candidate Andrew Yang says: “It’s just math.”  IF THERE’S NO REAL PATH, WILL A SANDERS PROTEST CAMPAIGN REMAIN? Top Sanders aides look back at 2016 and admit that the democratic socialist was running to make a point and didn’t expect his bid to blossom the way it did. This time, everyone in Sanders’ circle said he’s running to win. What does that mean if any reasonable path is closed? If Sanders remains, and his passionate base along with him, will they act more as advocates for his progressive preferences as an aggressive insurgency bent on attacking Biden?  Sanders and Biden have stuck mostly to differences on policy and vision. But Biden has made clear he’s aware of Sanders’ more outspoken supporters on social media. “I know I’m going to get a lot of suggestions on how to respond to what I suspect will be an increasingly negative campaign that the ‘Bernie Brothers’ will run,” Biden told a group of donors over the weekend. “But we can’t tear this party apart and reelect Trump. We have to keep our eyes on the ball.”  WHERE DO ELIZABETH WARREN’S BACKERS GO? Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren ran as a progressive in Sanders’ ideological lane, for months even avoiding her own single-payer health insurance proposal with a simple line: “I’m with Bernie.”  But Sanders and Biden aides have always quietly argued that Warren had more overlap at the ballot box with candidates like Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Kamala Harris –- each more moderate and establishment than Sanders. Put another way, Warren’s cultural lane –- white college-educated urban dweller -– was more important than her ideological lane. That worked well for Sanders when the field was crowded. Now, it’s not quite so helpful, with Super Tuesday trends suggesting Warren’s backers don’t migrate cleanly to Sanders. In fact, there was evidence that some of her supporters chose Biden even before Warren dropped out, since Biden won her home state of Massachusetts.  TURNOUT: WILL A NOVEMBER ANTI-TRUMP COALITION CONTINUE TO TAKE SHAPE? More surprising than Biden’s win total on Super Tuesday was the coalition behind it.  In Virginia, about 500,000 more voters cast ballots in 2020 than in the 2016 primary, and it didn’t help Sanders, who watched his vote share drop from 35% in 2016 to under 25% this year. Biden, alternately, drew about 200,000 more votes than Clinton did four years ago, fueled by his expected base of African Americans but also by white voters in the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.  In North Carolina, Democratic turnout increased by 180,000 votes, with similar tendencies among urban and suburban voters. Those trends in two November battleground states suggest an expanding Democratic electorate deeply dissatisfied with President Donald Trump. The diversity in Michigan — with heavily African American Detroit, the racially and ethnically mixed Detroit suburbs and wide swaths of working-class voters — will offer another general election battleground measure for that coalition’s enthusiasm.  WILL NON-SOUTHERN BLACK VOTERS DEVIATE FROM SOUTHERN TRENDS? African Americans showed up for Biden in a huge way on Super Tuesday, helping him win a competitive Texas primary and by wide margins in Alabama, North Carolina and Virginia. Whether that translates beyond the South could determine the outcome in Michigan and Missouri. In Detroit, Michigan’s largest city, more than 78% of residents are African American. Black voters are key in St. Louis and Kansas City, as well. Sanders likely will be hoping for a younger black electorate: AP VoteCast data from Super Tuesday showed the senator about even with Biden among black voters younger than 45.  But older African Americans usually vote in higher proportions. Biden expects a big victory in Mississippi, where a solid majority of Democratic ballots will be cast by African Americans. In neighboring Alabama last week, more than 7 out of 10 black voters chose Biden.  WHO CONSOLIDATES LABOR’S RANK AND FILE? Michigan has more than enough union members to sway a presidential primary (about 600,000, according to federal statistics). Biden and Sanders both make a claim on being labor’s candidate, Biden more through relationships with union leaders and Sanders with direct appeals to the rank and file.  Sanders got the better of that mix in Nevada. The Culinary Union there nodded to Biden by criticizing Sanders’ single-payer “Medicare for All” health insurance idea, but the union didn’t endorse, and caucus sites up and down the Las Vegas Strip showed Sanders got rank-and-file support.  Sanders will likely need a repeat in Michigan, where the most high-profile labor group -– the United Auto Workers –- hasn’t taken a side. ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.”",6 questions heading into next set of Democratic primaries,2020-03-09T21:29:20Z,https://apnews.com/adcd72c59fc174f2610a64c039ce1f28,AP
"CHICAGO (AP) — As former Vice President Joe Biden’s drive for the White House gains momentum, the 77-year-old’s political opponents on both the right and left have launched an internet campaign suggesting he’s not mentally or physically equipped to serve — sometimes using altered content and other disinformation to make their case. The effort prompted Twitter on Monday to mark a video of Biden shared by President Donald Trump as “manipulated media” — but only after it had been viewed millions of times. Facebook added warning labels to the video and reduced its distribution on its platform after news organizations fact checked the video on its site. The Associated Press works with Facebook as a third-party fact checker. The episode highlights the challenges social media companies face in containing the rapid spread of misleading information and raises questions about how prepared the companies are for a likely onslaught of disinformation during the 2020 campaign. It also underscores that trafficking in misinformation is not limited to one political party: Both Sanders’ and Trump’s backers aggressively promoted the unsubstantiated notion that Biden is in cognitive decline. “This is the worst kind of misinformation — it can impact a presidential election, and it’s being shared by the president with millions of followers,” said Jennifer Grygiel, a Syracuse University communications professor who studies disinformation and social media. “We’re going to see a lot more of it, and we need the platforms to get this right.” All in their 70s, Biden, Sanders and Trump have faced questions about their stamina or mental acumen, though each has produced letters from physicians attesting to his fitness for office. Sanders — who, like Biden, would be the oldest president ever elected — suffered a heart attack last year. Biden has long had a penchant for verbal miscues throughout his political career. And Trump has directly tried to combat questions about his mental fitness, tweeting in 2018 that he is a “very stable genius.”  The unproven claims about Biden’s fitness for office have emerged from the left and right with increasing frequency following the former vice president’s sweeping victories during last week’s Super Tuesday contests. And they accelerated after Biden returned to the campaign trail on Saturday with a brief speech in St. Louis.  Sanders’ campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, pointedly noted on Twitter that his 78-year-old boss had three campaign events on his schedule that day, “each speaking engagement extending for close to an hour.” Later in the day, Trump tweeted a misleadingly edited video clip from Biden’s 15-minute stump speech in Kansas City, Missouri. During the speech, Biden appeared to stumble over his words when he said: “We cannot win this reelection -- excuse me, we can only reelect Donald Trump if, in fact, we get engaged in this circular firing squad here.” Conservative and pro-Trump social media accounts first seized on the gaffe Saturday evening, sharing a fuller clip. But White House social media director Dan Scavino later shared a further edited version in which Biden appears to say: “We can only reelect Donald Trump.” Trump retweeted Scavino’s post. Different versions of the video were quickly shared by Twitter accounts affiliated with Trump’s campaign Saturday night over a three-hour period, noted Gideon Blocq, the CEO of VineSight, a tech company that surfaces misinformation online. Combined, the various versions of the edited clip were watched more than 10 million times by Monday afternoon.  The Biden campaign responded to the video with incredulity and noted that the former vice president has kept up a whirlwind schedule in recent weeks. The supposed evidence of his decline, they noted, comes from public appearances with voters and reporters present. “It’s revealing that Donald Trump and his campaign keep admitting, through their reliance on desperate smears, that they can’t beat Joe Biden with the truth,” said Biden spokesman Andrew Bates. Bates added a dig at Sanders supporters who have echoed many of the Republican attacks on Biden. “Any ‘Democrat’ who aligns themselves with Trump by amplifying his disinformation,” Bates said, “will soon learn that they can’t beat the vice president with wild-eyed lies, either.” Identifying, labeling and removing false claims or edited videos is emerging as a key challenge to tech platforms that have been criticized on both sides of the political spectrum. Twitter’s decision to mark the Biden video as “manipulated media” was the first test of a new policy of labeling and — in some cases removing — manipulated images designed to mislead. But even that effort failed to take hold for some social media users because of a technical error, a Twitter spokesman said Monday. It declined to say whether it had labeled other versions of the edited video.  Trump allies blasted Twitter’s decision to label the edited video as “manipulated.”  Trump legal adviser Jenna Ellis called criticism of the edited video, which she also shared, “insanely dishonest” on Twitter. She said people are missing the point: ”The point is the gaffe. DUH.” Liberal and pro-Sanders social media accounts have been promoting the idea that Biden is in “cognitive decline” on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter in recent days. A two-minute video montage of Biden’s gaffes on the campaign trail titled “Joe Biden’s sharp cognitive decline (please share, voters need to know)” has been viewed nearly 300,000 times since it was posted to a “populist” news and commentary YouTube page on Saturday.  ___ Klepper reported from Providence, R.I.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Monday held Iran responsible for the kidnapping of former FBI agent Robert Levinson, entering a default judgement against the regime on the 13th anniversary of his disappearance. The decision from U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly was a milestone moment in the family’s lawsuit against Tehran, which featured wrenching testimony in Washington’s federal court from each of Levinson’s seven children. “It is really important to the family that people realize what their father, their husband, has been through and what they’ve been through,” said David McGee, a lawyer for the family. “It is a terrible ordeal.” In his 25-page ruling, Kelly found that Iran “in no uncertain terms” was responsible for Levinson’s “hostage taking and torture” and entered a default judgment after the country declined to respond to the lawsuit. The family sought more than $1.5 billion in damages. Most of that amount was in punitive damages. “He has been unable to see his children grow up, enjoy professional success, marry, and become parents themselves — as they have many times over,” Kelly wrote in his judgment. “But they have not forgotten him, not by a long shot.” His daughters tied photographs of him to their bouquets on their wedding day, the judge said, and one named a son after him. Levinson disappeared on March 9, 2007, when he was scheduled to meet a source on the Iranian island of Kish. For years, U.S. officials would only say that Levinson was working independently on a private investigation.  But a 2013 Associated Press investigation revealed that Levinson had in fact been sent on a mission by CIA analysts who had no authority to run such an operation.  The family received proof-of-life photos and a video in late 2010 and early 2011, but his whereabouts and fate are not known. In November, the Iranian government unexpectedly responded to a United Nations query by saying that Levinson was the subject of an “open case” in Iranian Revolutionary Court. Though the development gave the family a burst of hope, Iran clarified that the “open case” was an investigation into his disappearance. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement Monday that the U.S. would continue working to free Levinson and other hostages held by Iran. The next step in the lawsuit will be the appointment of a special master to assess damages for individual family members and make a recommendation to the court. There are multiple sources of money the family can look to draw from to collect the damages, including Iran’s own assets. _____ Follow Eric Tucker at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP",US judge: Iran liable in disappearance of retired FBI agent,2020-03-09T22:25:45Z,https://apnews.com/805c0bcccc093e1a908202538450a6d6,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — Melania Trump has canceled a California fundraiser set for later this month.  Stephanie Grisham, the first lady’s spokeswoman, cited an unspecified “scheduling conflict” as the reason on Monday. The cancellation comes as organizations and groups around the country are scrapping large gatherings amid an outbreak of the new coronavirus.  President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign had been asking supporters to make a donation for a chance to meet the first lady in California. “Win a trip to meet first lady Melania Trump in Beverly Hills,” campaign literature said. A date for the event was not included, though it was believed to have been set for mid-March. Mrs. Trump will go ahead with plans to deliver remarks Tuesday at the National PTA Legislative Conference in Alexandria, Virginia, Grisham said.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Capitol’s attending physician said Monday that “several” members of Congress had contact with a person who attended a recent political conference and who subsequently developed COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus. They “remain in good health,” the physician’s office said. In a note to lawmakers, the attending physician’s office said the ill individual had recalled “specific names of people he had contact with during the meeting.” “Several of these individuals, Members of the Congress, were identified and were contacted on the evening of March 7” by the physician’s office, the note said.  Their symptoms were reviewed, and the individuals were considered to be at “low risk” of contracting the disease, the statement said. It said all the lawmakers the physician’s office was monitoring “remain in good health.”  On Sunday, two members of Congress, Sen. Ted Cruz and Rep. Paul Gosar, said they are isolating themselves after determining they had contact with the person at the conference.  Cruz, R-Texas, said Sunday he had brief contact with the man at the Conservative Political Action Conference nearly two weeks ago and would spend the next few days at his home in Texas until a full 14 days had passed since their interaction. Gosar, R-Ariz., said that he had made contact with the man at CPAC and that he and three members of his senior staff were under self-quarantine. His office will be closed for the week, he said in a tweet Sunday. President Donald Trump also attended the CPAC meeting.  Besides Cruz and Gosar, the CPAC schedule listed three other senators and 12 House members who were scheduled to speak. They included No. 2 House GOP leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana, No. 3 Republican leader Liz Cheney of Wyoming and congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina, who has since become the White House chief of staff.￼￼ Also on the schedule was Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Cheney has been told by CPAC that she was not exposed to the convention attendee who has tested positive for the coronavirus, a Cheney spokesman said. Both President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence spoke at CPAC, but the White House said there was no indication that either had met or been in “close proximity” to the infected attendee. Cruz said he met the man being treated for coronavirus 10 days ago at the conference in Oxon Hill, Maryland. The Texas Republican said he’s not experiencing any symptoms, feels fine and has been advised by medical authorities that the odds of transmission were extremely low. Yet, Cruz said, out of an abundance of caution he will remain at home. He said medical authorities advised him that those who have interacted with him in the last 10 days should not be concerned about potential transmission. David Popp, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky￼., said Sunday evening that no changes had been made in the chamber’s schedule in the wake of Cruz’s decision to remain in Texas. McConnell had spoken with Cruz, Popp said. The Senate has a vote scheduled Monday evening and plans to be in session this week considering energy and possibly other legislation. The Senate and the House are set for a one-week recess the week of March 16. ___ Associated Press writers Randall Chase in Dover, Del., and Robert Burns in Washington contributed to this report.",Several lawmakers had contact with man at CPAC who got virus,2020-03-09T04:46:03Z,https://apnews.com/57f617e8dd67053e9104ce7f870b3504,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — Several hundred people are being asked to self-quarantine after potential exposure to the first confirmed case of the new coronavirus in Washington D.C., identified as the rector of prominent Episcopal church.  District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser said Monday that anyone who entered Christ Church Georgetown on Feb. 24 or between Feb. 28 and March 3 is requested to self-quarantine for two weeks from the date of their entrance to the church.  The new precautions come as the virus continues to roil the normal routine in the nation’s capital. A popular convention city and a springtime destination for hundreds of school trips and thousands of tourists, Washington officials have insisted that the city remains open for business. But tourism leaders admit that they expect virus fears to cut into the visitor numbers — including for the popular Cherry Blossom Festival, which starts on March 20.  Officials on Saturday had announced the district’s first positive test, but identified the victim only as a man in his 50s. A second local positive test involves a man who visited the Washington area from Nigeria, but he was being hospitalized in Maryland. Rev. Timothy Cole, the church rector, announced Sunday that he was the person whom city officials had been referring to as “patient 1.” He remains hospitalized in stable condition and the church has canceled all activities until further notice.  Late Monday, the district announced three more confirmed cases, including one man who had attended Christ Church. The church’s Facebook page said its organist/choirmaster was quarantined at home but feeling well “given the circumstances.”  Dr. Anjali Talwalkar of the Washington Health Department said Monday that an exposure risk is defined as coming within six feet of a person with active virus symptoms.  “Several hundred people were potentially impacted,” she said.  A Washington high school linked to the second case was closed Monday, though no new confirmed coronavirus cases have been reported. Three people who stayed at the same house as the Nigerian man who tested positive in Maryland were tested Sunday and all were negative. But one of them works at the School Without Walls High School. Bowser said the school was closed for a deep cleaning and to give time to communicate with staff and parents; she expects the school to re-open Tuesday.  Two charter schools in Washington, D.C., also voluntarily closed Monday but there have been no reported or suspected virus cases linked to either.  Several Republican members of Congress announced they would self-quarantine after coming in contact with an infected person during the recent Conservative Political Action Conference.  Bowser said she was “evaluating” whether to declare a ”public health emergency” if the virus continues to spread. As both a mayor and the de-facto governor of a quasi-state, Bowser has more powers than the average city mayor. Formally declaring a health emergency would enable her to impose quarantines and closures and also take steps to prevent price gouging on supplies, she said.  “I don’t believe that’s where we are right now,” Bowser said.  Maryland has reported six confirmed cases. Virginia has reported three.  ___ Associated Press writers Michael Balsamo and Robert Burns in Washington, and Randall Chase in Dover, Delaware, contributed to this report.",Hundreds in DC asked to quarantine after exposure in church,2020-03-09T04:48:24Z,https://apnews.com/575774c710e6413383dd1c7fd9419002,AP
"DETROIT (AP) — Bernie Sanders proved his 2016 presidential bid was serious with an upset victory in Michigan powered by his opposition to free trade and appeal among working-class voters. Four years later, the same state could either revive the Vermont senator’s campaign or relegate him to the role of protest candidate. Michigan and five other states hold presidential contests on Tuesday at a critical point in the Democratic race.  Former Vice President Joe Biden is looking to quash Sanders’ hopes and cement his own front-runner status just a week after resurrecting his beleaguered White House bid with a delegate victory on Super Tuesday. He played up his underdog story on Monday as he campaigned across Michigan, reflecting on his stutter as a child and the deaths of his first wife and young daughter.  And Biden wasn’t alone. The former vice president courted the state’s influential African American voters alongside the two most prominent black candidates previously in the 2020 race, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, who endorsed Biden in recent days as part of a broader consolidation of support among party leaders. Sanders is in an urgent fight to turn things around as the primary calendar quickly shifts to other states that could favor Biden and narrow his path to the nomination. The senator countered the parade of Democratic firepower lining up behind Biden by securing the endorsement of the Rev. Jesse Jackson and deploying Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., on his behalf. Having devoted several days to Michigan, the Vermont senator spent the eve of Tuesday’s primaries in Missouri, where he downplayed questions about electability and insisted that the “energy and excitement” of his supporters made him the strongest Democrat to run against President Donald Trump this fall.  Tuesday marks the first time voters will weigh in on the Democratic contest since it effectively narrowed to a two-person race between Sanders and Biden. It will be another test of whether Sanders can broaden his appeal among African Americans. Biden, meanwhile, must show that he can keep momentum going after his surprise Super Tuesday turnaround.  “I like his chances,” Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who has endorsed Biden, said of the former vice president in an interview. “He knows Michigan,” Whitmer added. “When our back was up against the wall during the auto struggles of the past, it was Barack Obama and Joe Biden who had our backs.” That’s a reference to the Obama administration overseeing federal bailouts that helped the auto industry — the lifeblood of Michigan’s economy — weather the 2009 financial crisis. Sanders counters that he, too, voted to save the auto industry. He also says that, unlike Biden, he opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he said prompted thousands of Michigan jobs to move to Mexico since taking effect in 1994. Biden ticked off the names of six former presidential rivals who have endorsed him just in the past week during a Monday appearance with Booker in Flint, Michigan, a community that has seen auto industry jobs disappear: “They’ve all come out and endorsed at one time ... the candidate that they think can win.” And later in Detroit, he stood on stage grasping hands with Whitmer, Booker and Harris, a powerful trio of potential vice presidential picks should Biden become the Democrats’ presidential nominee.  The large rally was interrupted repeatedly by protesters, however, who railed against Biden’s support for the North American Free Trade Agreement and his reluctance to embrace sweeping environmental proposals outlined in the so-called Green New Deal.  In a scuffle with environmental protesters in the midst of Biden’s remarks, senior adviser Symone Sanders was knocked to the ground. She was not hurt. Less than a week ago she tackled a protester who rushed the stage as Biden spoke in California. Other economic challenges emerged on Monday as fears about the spread of the new coronavirus shook financial markets, slicing 7.8% from the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Sanders held a roundtable with health experts in Detroit, and Biden said he would defer to health experts about whether campaign events could continue, given concerns about the spread of the virus. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert, stopped short of calling on candidates to put a pause on political rallies. Instead, he said he wouldn’t criticize someone seeking office for putting a pause on big gatherings. “If you’re talking about a campaign rally tomorrow in a place where there is no community spread, I think the judgment to have it might be a good judgment,” Fauci said Monday at a White House briefing. “If you want to talk about large gatherings in a place where you have community spread, I think that’s a judgment call.” An outstanding question going into Tuesday is whether Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who dropped out of the race last week, will endorse Biden or Sanders. So far, she’s declined to back either, an especially frustrating development for Sanders, who could use Warren’s help in unifying progressives in much the same way Biden has been able to rally moderates. Sanders has scoffed at suggestions he could drop out if he doesn’t win Michigan, but his travel schedule underscores its importance. He canceled a trip to Mississippi and instead made five campaign stops across Michigan since Friday.  Sanders won’t say if he’s personally lobbying Warren for her endorsement. He did manage to secure the backing of Jackson, who said it was no time for centrist compromise.  He jabbed Biden during a Monday appearance in downtown St. Louis, reminding a largely young crowd of the former vice president’s long record in Washington. Sanders noted that unlike Biden, he opposed the war in Iraq, Wall Street bailouts after the 2008 collapse and any talk of cuts to Social Security. “In a general election, which candidate can generate the enthusiasm and the excitement and the voter turnout we need?” Sanders asked. “If you want to defeat Trump, which all Democrats do and the majority of independents do and some Republicans do, we are that campaign.”  One of Sanders’ highest-profile supporters, Ocasio-Cortez, struck a far more conciliatory tone the day before addressing 10,000-plus on the campus of the University of Michigan on Sunday night, saying, “In order for us to win, we have to grow.”  “We must be inclusive. We must bring more people into this movement,” she said, urging Sanders supporters to shed “cynicism and exclusion” and “turn with an embracing posture, where all people are welcome in a people’s movement.”  Sanders is optimistic about Washington state on Tuesday, but could face hurdles in Mississippi and Missouri. Sanders’ team acknowledges he will also struggle in next week’s Florida primary, where the senator’s past defense of Fidel Castro looms large. He also could face long odds in Ohio and Illinois — especially if he underperforms in Michigan. Both of those states also vote March 17. The wild card next week could be Arizona, where Sanders will be counting on strong Latino support, which lifted him to victory in California.  Sanders advisers are aware that Biden could build an insurmountable delegate lead if he runs up the score in the upcoming contests. They hope to continue doing well in the West before picking up momentum in places like delegate-rich New York, which holds its primary next month.  There’s no guarantee Sanders could last that long this time, however, given the higher expectations he now faces. Even some of those attending Sanders rallies are beginning to feel it, although his St. Louis audience was optimistic. Alec McAulay, a 19-year-old college student from St. Louis County, said Sanders has proved that he’s a true alternative to the president.  “I think Biden agrees with Trump too much, more than any Democrat should,” McAulay said.  ___ Associated Press writers Seth Borenstein in Washington and Steve Peoples in Flint, Mich., contributed to this report. ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.”",Stakes rise for Sanders heading into Michigan primary,2020-03-09T17:40:42Z,https://apnews.com/77e7604edc7d78e27063c47c24162b63,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Monday his administration will ask Congress to pass payroll tax relief and other quick measures as a public health and economic maelstrom brought on by the coronavirus drew closer to him personally. Intending to calm the fears of financial markets over the impact of the epidemic, Trump told reporters he is seeking “very substantial relief” to the payroll tax. Trump also said he was seeking help for hourly-wage workers to ensure they’re “not going to miss a paycheck” and “don’t get penalized for something that’s not their fault.” He stepped forward with the contours of an initiative after markets dropped sharply and as the outbreak spread. Several Trump confidants in Congress disclosed they were isolating themselves after potential exposure to the virus; one traveled with the president from Florida on Air Force One on Monday; another was his just-tapped new chief of staff. Trump said he would hold a press conference Tuesday to outline the proposals, saying his administration and Congress would be “discussing a possible payroll tax cut or relief, substantial relief, very substantial relief, that’s big, that’s a big number. We’re also going to be talking about hourly wage earners getting help so that they can be in a position where they’re not going to ever miss a paycheck.” As Trump grappled with an epidemic whose consequences he has repeatedly played down, the White House asserted it was conducting “business as usual.” But the day’s business was anything but normal. Lawmakers pressed for details on how the Capitol could be made secure, handshakes on the Hill were discouraged and a Pentagon meeting was broken into sub-groups to minimize the number of people in the same room. The president himself dove into handshakes with supporters earlier in the day, when arriving to headline a fundraiser in Longwood, Florida, that raised approximately $4 million for his reelection campaign and the Republican Party.  On his flight back to Washington he was accompanied by Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, who later went into a voluntary quarantine. He was one of several GOP lawmakers who were exposed to a person at last month’s Conservative Political Action Conference who tested positive for the virus. His office said he was “mid-flight” on Air Force One when CPAC informed his staff that he had been in contact with the attendee who had the virus. Once the plane landed, Gaetz was immediately tested. Vice President Mike Pence, who also spoke at CPAC, said he has not been tested for the virus. White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said Trump has not been tested because he has not had “prolonged close contacts” with any patients and “does not have any symptoms.” In Monday morning tweets, Trump vented about the market drop and news that large public gatherings were being called off because of the virus.  “At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths,” Trump tweeted, comparing it to seasonal influenza and the thousands of deaths that causes. “Think about that!”  Scientists at this stage don’t know what the death rate of the new coronavirus actually is and whether it will wind up being about the same as flu or worse. At the same time, administration officials were insistent that they weren’t trying to dismiss public concerns. “This is a very serious health problem,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told Fox News.  At the Pentagon, officials have begun “social distancing” measures.  On Monday, Defense Secretary Mark Esper’s regular meeting with senior staff, which normally would be held face-to-face in a single room with 40 to 50 participants, was broken up into three rooms, with video-teleconferencing among the rooms, according to the Pentagon’s chief spokesman, Jonathan Hoffman. He said Esper and the 15 to 20 people in his room, including Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, sat at least six feet apart, in line with health guidance. Trump was delegating much of the virus response to Pence, who convened a video teleconference to give an update on the federal government’s virus response Monday afternoon with the nation’s governors. Trump met his top economic advisers before emerging to disclose he’ll seek the payroll tax break. The White House has been convening meetings with an array of travel and healthcare industry representatives, and was set to host Wall Street executives at the White House on Wednesday to discuss the economic fallout of the epidemic. Futures in the S&P 500 index, which can indicate how Wall Street will open Tuesday, were up more than 2.5% late Monday after the administration’s news conference. On Capitol Hill, where many lawmakers are older and have frequent contact with the public, leaders were fielding questions from members and staff about how the complex will be secured. Leaders have so far shown little willingness to close the Capitol, but meetings were scheduled throughout the day to discuss preparations.  On Monday, Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., and Gaetz put themselves in voluntary quarantine because of their contacts with someone at the Conservative Political Action Conference.  Both said they did not have any symptoms but would wait out the remainder of the 14 days since the contact at home. Gaetz last week wore a gas mask to the House vote on the emergency funding bill for the virus response and said he wanted to highlight how Congress could become “petri dish” for the virus.  Collins had met with Trump last Tuesday night at the White House and shook hands with him Friday when the president visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Atlanta headquarters. Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., whom Trump named Friday as his incoming chief of staff, also went into self-quarantine. “A precautionary test came back negative & he feels great,” his spokesman tweeted late Monday. Meadows has not yet resigned his congressional seat and has not yet assumed his new role at the White House, but he is a frequent visitor.  Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., also placed themselves in quarantine after coming in contact with the same person at the conservative conference. Rep. Julia Brownley, D-Calif., said she met last week with a person who has since been diagnosed with the virus. She closed her office and said she and her staff are “self-monitoring and maintaining social distancing practices.” Vast numbers of visitors come to the Hill, especially at this time of year when advocacy groups arrange “fly-in” trips to lobby and speak to lawmakers, and school groups descend for tours.  One Republican who said he was informed he had been exposed at the conservative conference, Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas, tweeted that he was cleared to return to Washington. He was spotted leading a Capitol tour for more than 100 visitors late Monday evening. In one manifestation of lawmaking in the age of the coronavirus, Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., approached a Republican colleague on the House floor Monday for a routine congratulatory handshake after the chamber approved a bill expanding a visa program. “Shake or bump?” Neal asked Rep. Kelly Armstrong, R-N.D.  The two men bumped elbows. Offices on Capitol Hill also advertised they were holding “no contact meetings” and asked guests to refrain from shaking hands. The chairman of the Democratic caucus, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, said the House’s chief administrative officer and the sergeant at arms are expected to brief Democrats at their regular caucus meeting Tuesday. The discussion was expected to address whether the Capitol will be restricted to visitors, he said. It was not immediately clear how Trump was aiming to provide assistance to employees weighing whether to stay home because of illness — a crucial aim of public health officials seeking to curtail the spread of the virus. One mechanism, backed by the Trump-allied National Association of Manufacturers, involves a proposed tax credit for employers who pay employees who are quarantined. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Larry Kudlow, the director of the national economic council, were expected to bring the White House proposal to Senate Republicans on Tuesday afternoon, at which point officials planned to release more publicly. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill had barely started to contemplate the economic implications of the spread of the virus and what might be needed to stimulate the economy as people cancel vacations and business trips and stay away from stores. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley told reporters that “everything’s on the table.” But members of the Senate Republican leadership, including Texas Sen. John Cornyn played down the need for an economic stimulus package of any kind, be it tax cuts or aid for workers. “It’s premature to be talking about that,” Cornyn told reporters. “I usually love tax cuts but I think it’s a little premature.” Democrats panned — for now — Trump’s proposed payroll tax cut. They said it was not specific enough to the core problem and are preparing their own package of aid, including affordable testing, unemployment benefits and paid leave for working families affected by the virus. “Unfortunately at the president’s press conference today, he really did not address the coronavirus issue,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, standing alongside Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer after a late meeting at the Capitol. “This is about the kitchen table of America’s working families.” A House vote could come as soon as this week, Pelosi said, but more likely would shift to April.  While they did not completely oppose Trump’s proposed payroll tax cut, they said they prefer their approach as a better way to instill confidence in families and the economy. “Unless you deal with the pandemic the stock market’s going to keep getting worse and worse and worse,” Schumer said. “If there’s going to be relief it ought to be aimed at the families that are most affected.”  A day after saying it was “proceeding as normal,” Trump’s campaign canceled a three-day Women for Trump bus tour across Michigan that included Mercedes Schlapp, the former White House aide who is married to the American Conservative Union chairman, Matt Schlapp.  Schlapp is under self-quarantine after after he, too, was exposed to the infected person at CPAC. He introduced Trump and greeted him with a handshake on stage before the president’s spoke on Feb. 29. ___ Associated Press writers Lauran Neergaard, Andy Taylor, Kevin Freking, Jill Colvin, Bob Burns, Lisa Mascaro and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A top Minnesota prosecutor said Monday that Sen. Amy Klobuchar should ask the Justice Department to review the conviction of a black teen sentenced to life in prison after an 11-year-old black girl was killed by a stray bullet. In doing so, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman appeared to be putting the onus back on Klobuchar. Just last week, the senator asked Freeman to launch an independent investigation into the case that dogged her unsuccessful Democratic presidential primary run. Myon Burrell, now 33, has spent more than half his life in prison for the killing of Tyesha Edwards, who was hit by a stray bullet on Nov. 22, 2002, while doing homework at her dining room table.  A yearlong Associated Press investigation published last month exposed major flaws in the police probe and prosecution, raising questions as to whether he may have been wrongfully convicted. Klobuchar was in charge of the Hennepin County attorney’s office from 1999 through 2006. Her office prosecuted Burrell during his first trial, in which he was convicted, and sentenced in 2003. Klobuchar was succeeded by Freeman, who oversaw a second trial for Burrell, who was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. “Only the Department of Justice would have the resources to independently review a case that includes 30,000 pages of documents plus videotaped evidence,” Freeman wrote, adding that his office would cooperate with any DOJ efforts while carrying out its own review of the case.  Burrell’s lawyer, Dan Guerrero, said he was “encouraged but skeptical” about the latest development in the case.  “I wish the two offices would get together and do the right thing,” he said, adding that Freeman’s press release wildly exaggerated the amount of paperwork tied to the case. “I’ve reviewed the entire investigation and two prosecutions, and there are nowhere close to 30,000 pages involved here.”  Klobuchar, throughout her political career, has used Burrell’s conviction to trumpet her commitment to racial justice, but she has faced increasing criticism from the African American community in Minnesota and national media following the AP report.  Klobuchar outlasted several better-known and better-funded candidates in the Democratic presidential primary, thanks to a better-than-expected third-place finish in in New Hampshire. But she couldn’t turn that into success elsewhere, as she struggled to build out a campaign that could compete across the country and had poor showings in the next contests. She canceled a rally in her home state two days before the Minnesota Democratic primary after around 100 protesters took over the stage, waving signs and chanting “Free Myon!” Less than 24 hours later, she ended her campaign and endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden. Civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong had mixed feelings about Freeman’s call for a DOJ investigation. It’s better than his previous stance — than an internal review of his own office was sufficient. But he now seems to be “passing the buck to an entity that currently falls under the Trump administration.” She feels he should “put forward the resources for an independent investigation by a credible agency outside the state of Minnesota” and that he “needs to set up a conviction integrity unit as both the ACLU and the NAACP have called for.” “As a community, we must continue to put pressure on Mike Freeman until Myon Burrell is free,” she said. “It is clear that he doesn’t care about justice.” ",Minn. prosecutor: Justice Dept. should review Burrell case,2020-03-09T21:48:30Z,https://apnews.com/1bfd6c27531b83be9b6626d2d09ab6eb,AP
"HELENA, Mont. (AP) — Montana Gov. Steve Bullock said Monday he will run against first-term Republican Sen. Steve Daines, giving Democrats a boost in their effort to take control of the Senate in November. His decision to run is an about-face made at the last minute for the two-term governor, who ended his long-shot bid for president in December and  had repeatedly insisted he had no interest in running for the Senate.  Flanked by his family, Bullock told reporters he previously rejected the idea of another campaign out of consideration for his wife Lisa and their three school-age children who have been in the public eye for most of their lives. But they decided as a family to go ahead on the final day that candidates can file for the elections. “As a family, we’ve been talking about this quite a bit as of late,” Bullock said in a news conference after filing his paperwork. “We decided that I can either wish that Washington worked more like Montana or we would try to do something about it. We decided that this wasn’t the time to be on the sidelines or step back.” Lisa Bullock said the family had to work through issues including wanting to spend time with their oldest daughter, Caroline, who will be leaving for college later this year, along with the grind and negativity that comes with campaigning. “Campaigns are hard on families,” Lisa Bullock said. “I think it’s been hard in the last three (campaigns) for our children to witness what has been published and what has been said about their father.” Democrats need to win four seats now held by Republicans, without losing any to win outright control of the Senate. If President Donald Trump is defeated, the Democrats would need a net gain of three seats and the vice-president’s tie-breaking vote for control. Bullock had come under increasing pressure to run since dropping his presidential bid, including meeting with former President Barack Obama in Washington. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer recently traveled to Montana to meet with Bullock. Former Democratic Sen. Max Baucus said the meeting between Schumer, Bullock and their wives was key to the decision. Bullock is seeking Baucus’ old seat. Bullock said Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s control of the issues that go before the Senate — health insurance, prescription drugs, outside money in campaigns — influenced him to run more than Schumer. “To me, that’s a lot more motivation than any national Democrat,” Bullock said. Baucus said it “probably helped” that former Vice President Joe Biden has surged in the Democratic presidential primary race, making it less likely that self-described democratic socialist Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders will lead the ticket in the strongly pro-Trump state. Bullock said Biden’s comeback wasn’t part of his consideration. Four of the five other Democrats who had announced Senate bids dropped out by Monday evening. Daines has the backing of Trump, for whom the state overwhelmingly voted in 2016. Trump has tweeted his support for Daines, who recently met with the Republican president at the White House. Daines’ campaign manager, Shane Scanlon, did not directly respond to Bullock’s decision in a comment to The Associated Press. “We’re going to win this race because Steve Daines is always on Montana’s side fighting for more high-paying jobs, against big government and defending Montanans’ way of life,” Scanlon said. As Bullock frequently pointed out during his presidential campaign, he was the only Democratic governor to win reelection in a state Trump won in 2016. Trump also traveled to Montana four times to campaign against incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester in the 2018 election, but Tester won, anyway. Republicans started the campaign against Bullock by saying he caved to party leaders to run for a job he doesn’t want. “Governor Bullock is nothing more than Chuck Schumer’s puppet,” Montana Republican Party Executive Director Spenser Merwin said. “If it only took one trip to Montana to bully him into running for Senate, can you imagine how easy it will be to get Bullock to vote for the Democrats’ socialist agenda.” ___ Associated Press writer Alan Fram in Washington contributed to this report. ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.”",Montana Gov.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — With coronavirus topping Americans’ concerns, senior Trump administration officials tried to switch subjects Monday by announcing final rules aimed at delivering on the unfulfilled promise of electronic health records. It did not go smoothly as reporters veered back to the global outbreak increasingly affecting U.S. communities. “The notion that we can’t do our day jobs and work on this very serious issue (coronavirus) is absurd,” said a frustrated Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar after one reporter noted that financial markets had opened sharply lower over fears of global economic damage from the outbreak. Azar recapped administration actions to try to contain the spread of the virus in the U.S., develop tests, treatments and vaccines, work with local officials in areas that are seeing outbreaks, and care for the sick. Announcement of the technology rules was originally planned at a health care conference in Florida, but that event was canceled over coronavirus concerns.  The long-awaited rules could take several years for consumers and patients to start seeing the practical effects. They are intended to get at one of the major problems with electronic health records: the systems of hospitals and doctors often don’t ‘talk’ to each other, and patients struggle to get their medical information digitally transmitted, defaulting to CDs and faxed paper records. The federal government invested more than $30 billion a decade ago to help hospitals and doctors convert to computerized records. But it never solved the problems of getting the different medical systems to seamlessly interact, and of providing a pathway for patients to easily access their records. Two rules finalized by the Trump administration aim to finally fix that. The regulations are highly complex. Hospitals and a consumer group objected, saying that patient privacy would be undermined. One rule from the HHS agency that oversees health care technology would implement congressional requirements that hospitals and other health care entities put a stop to practices that can block the digital transfer of information. Some systems don’t allow screen shots or video to be shared, for example. The health care technology office rule also tries to address access problems at the patient’s level. It requires hospitals and other health care service providers to allow access to records via software used by smartphone apps, such as the ones that already handle banking and credit card transactions. Patients could literally access their records via the smartphone in their back pocket. A companion rule from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services would require health plans in Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, “Obamacare” and the children’s health insurance program to give patients access to their information through apps compatible with smartphones. CMS will also require hospitals to electronically notify a patient’s outside doctors when that patient is admitted, discharged or transferred. The hope is that easier access and authorized sharing of individuals’ health care information will help prevent medical errors, cut down on duplicative tests, and help patients become smarter consumers of health care services. But Rick Pollack, president of the American Hospital Association, said a new generation of health care apps could put the personal information of patients at risk, since the app developers would not be required to meet the same legal standards for privacy that are imposed on hospitals. “This could lead to third party apps using personal health information in ways in which patients are unaware,” Pollack said in a statement.  The consumer advocacy group Public Citizen also criticized the new rules, saying they fail to guarantee that sensitive information won’t fall into the hands of third parties that could exploit it for profit. CMS says it intends improve on health care privacy standards in the smart phone industry to provide consumers with a higher level of protection. In addition to Azar, among the top administration officials joining to make the announcement were White House health policy chief Joe Grogan, CMS Administrator Seema Verma, and Donald Rucker, the government’s National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. The administration’s plan had been to make the announcement at a global health technology conference sponsored by the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society in Orlando this week. But that event was canceled due to concerns about large gatherings where travelers can unwittingly spread coronavirus. “Sorry we can’t see you in Orlando, which was our original plan here,” technology coordinator Rucker told reporters. ___ An earlier version of this story was corrected to show that the rule requiring patient information be available through smartphone apps came from the HHS technology office, not the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.","Amid virus crisis, officials announce health care tech rules",2020-03-09T14:59:06Z,https://apnews.com/78f9bae088dec0debb4b044565f9a323,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge has ordered that an independent medical panel conduct a review of the mental health of a Saudi prisoner at the Guantanamo Bay detention center who has been accused of trying to enter the U.S. to be the 20th hijacker in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Mohammed al-Qahtani has been held at Guantanamo for 18 years but never charged because a Pentagon legal official determined he had been tortured at the U.S. base in Cuba.  Lawyers for al-Qahtani say he has suffered from mental illness, including schizophrenia, since childhood and should be returned home to Saudi Arabia for psychiatric confinement and treatment. The government opposes repatriation and says he can be treated at Guantanamo.  On Friday, U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer directed the government to set up a Mixed Medical Commission. It would consist of an American military doctor along with two physicians from a neutral third country to determine if his condition meets the standard for required medical repatriation according to Army regulations governing the treatment of prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions. It would be the first time such a commission has been ordered at Guantanamo but Shayana Kadidal, an attorney for the 45-year-old prisoner said a similar process was used for thousands of captured German troops during World War II.  “It is something that is part of the traditional make up of military detention,” Kadidal said. “It’s not something novel. It’s in the Army’s own regs.”  The Department of Justice said Monday that it is reviewing the judge’s ruling and has not said whether it would appeal. The Department of Defense did not comment. Justice Department lawyers argued previously that al-Qahtani is held as an enemy combatant not a prisoner of war, and does not qualify for the full protection of the Geneva Conventions. Al-Qahtani was turned away from the country by U.S. immigration officers at the Orlando airport in August 2001 suspicious of the circumstances of his travel. The lead Sept. 11 hijacker, Mohammed Atta, was going to pick him up to take part in the plot, according to previously released documents. U.S. forces later captured him in Afghanistan and sent him to Guantanamo, where he was subjected to brutal interrogations that the Pentagon legal official in charge of the war crimes commissions said amounted to torture.  The treatment included beatings, exposure to extreme temperatures and noise, sleep deprivation and extended solitary confinement. An FBI official in 2002 observed al-Qahtani speaking to non-existent people, hearing voices and crouching in a corner of his cell while covering himself with a sheet for hours at a time. A multi-agency board that has reviewed his confinement has repeatedly determined he poses a threat to U.S. security and should not be released from the detention center, where he is one of 40 prisoners in custody. His lawyers argue that he could not fully participate in the review of his case because of his mental illnesses, which also includes major depression and a possible neurocognitive disorder from a traumatic brain injury caused by a childhood car accident. They also say his illness raises questions about whether he could have been held legally responsible even if he was charged with attempting to take part in the Sept. 11 attacks or would pose a threat if repatriated.  “We hope that the end point would be that he gets transferred back to basically psychiatric confinement in Saudi Arabia,” Kadidal said. “That’s what someone with such severe disease would need and that’s not something that poses a risk to anybody.”",Judge orders medical panel for '20th hijacker' at Guantanamo,2020-03-09T18:20:46Z,https://apnews.com/3b0e4dc4bca437180ae1cdfeefedded7,AP
"GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) — Two of the nation’s largest gun control advocacy groups have endorsed Joe Biden, the latest sign that Bernie Sanders’ spotty record on guns may be weighing him down in the presidential primary. Everytown for Gun Safety and Brady announced they are backing the former vice president. Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund plans to spend $60 million on electoral activities this cycle, some of which will go toward trying to elect Biden. An Everytown spokesman said the group typically airs advertisements and engages in grassroots organizing for the candidates it endorses, though it’s unclear when the group will begin to spend on Biden’s behalf. The group, which was co-founded by billionaire former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg, also boasts 6 million supporters and more than 375,000 grassroots donors, numbers that could help boost attention and support for Biden’s presidential bid nationwide. Brady, another leading gun violence prevention group, endorsed Biden on Sunday. The group said in a statement that as a senator, Biden worked with Jim and Sarah Brady to pass the landmark Brady Bill, which established mandatory background checks for gun sales. Biden also championed a 1994 federal assault weapons ban. “Joe Biden has worked with the gun violence prevention movement, with survivors and with lawmakers his entire career,″ Brady President Kris Brown said. ”We know him, and he knows us. We know he will work to deliver this change.″ Biden said he was honored to receive the endorsements and lamented that the high rate of gun violence in the U.S. has become “normal” for most Americans. For those who are connected to gun violence, “normal is a living nightmare,” Biden said. In an interview with The Associated Press, John Feinblatt, head of Everytown for Gun Safety, said the group chose Biden because working for gun control is “his past, it’s his present, it’s his future.” Asked if Sanders’ record on gun control factored into the group’s decision, Feinblatt said that the group looks at a candidate’s “total record.” “You can’t confine yourself to just what somebody says they’ll do in the future. You have to look at what they’ve done in the past,” he said. “Unquestionably, Joe is a person who’s dedicated much of his life to the issue of gun safety.” Feinblatt cited Biden’s support for the 1993 Brady Bill, which established background checks and a waiting period to buy most firearms, as well as Biden’s opposition to measures that would shield gun manufacturers from lawsuits over misuse of their guns. He also pointed to Biden’s work on the Violence Against Women Act, which included some gun control provisions. During his tenure in the House and the Senate, Sanders opposed the Brady Bill and supported bills that would give gun manufacturers immunity from lawsuits. His position on gun control issues has shifted, and he now has a D-minus rating from the National Rifle Association. But Sanders’ past votes have been frequent fodder for attacks from his opponents, dating back to his 2016 Democratic primary fight with Hillary Clinton. Most recently, Sanders came under attack during the South Carolina debate two weeks ago from multiple opponents for his record on guns, with Biden charging, as he stood next to the Vermont senator, that “my friend on my right and others have given gun manufacturers absolute immunity.” Biden also has run ads highlighting his work on gun control measures. “I’ve taken on the NRA and defeated them twice,” he said. “And I believe we need a candidate for president who will fight alongside these leaders, not the NRA or gun manufacturers.” Everytown for Gun Safety is largely financed by Bloomberg, a former 2020 presidential candidate who dropped out of the race and endorsed Biden last week. ___ Associated Press writer Matthew Daly in Washington contributed to this story.  ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.”",Major gun safety groups endorse Joe Biden's presidential bid,2020-03-09T09:46:34Z,https://apnews.com/097658df500f68856184bf594e417016,AP
"DETROIT (AP) — Presidential politics move fast. What we’re watching heading into a new week on the 2020 campaign: ___ Days to next set of primaries (Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Washington) : 1  Days to general election: 249 ___ THE NARRATIVE The earth has shifted over the last seven days. The Democrats’ 2020 primary has suddenly become a two-person race in which Joe Biden has a distinct advantage over Bernie Sanders. It’s difficult to exaggerate the speed with which things have changed. Last weekend there were five major candidates still in the primary fight, and Sanders was threatening to build an insurmountable delegate lead. But in the span of 72 hours, two leading moderates dropped out and the party’s establishment wing sprinted into Biden’s camp. The former vice president used the extraordinary rush of momentum to seize a delegate advantage on Super Tuesday. And with Sanders struggling to unify the progressive wing behind him ( Elizabeth Warren is out but has refused to endorse), he enters another multistate primary test on Tuesday facing the prospect that Biden could soon build an insurmountable delegate lead. ___ THE BIG QUESTIONS Can Bernie get back on track in Michigan? As we learned last week, it’s a mistake to focus too much on one state. After all, Sanders won Super Tuesday’s biggest delegate prize, California, and still finished the day with fewer delegates than Biden. With that warning, Michigan deserves your attention this week. The Midwestern state offers the largest trove of delegates on Tuesday and, almost as importantly, serves as a huge symbolic test of Sanders’ remaining political strength. Michigan helped rescue his candidacy four years ago, and it sits as one of three key battlegrounds Democrats desperately need to win in November. Going in this time, Sanders’ team had been supremely confident about his standing with the state and its large working-class population — at least until last week’s shakeup. Sanders knows he will not win them all, but he can’t afford to lose this one. How does Biden handle front-runner status this time? Biden has plenty of experience as a front-runner. And he hasn’t always fared so well under the bright lights that go with it. After nearly being forced from the race last month following a dreadful start, the 77-year-old gaffe-prone Democrat gets another chance to prove he belongs on top. He will benefit from a lack of establishment alternatives should he stumble. He’ll also benefit from the new phase of the race, which has essentially become a series of national contests where voters won’t get to see the candidates as closely as they did in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. Still, make no mistake: Biden will face a new wave of fire from the right and the left this week as he seeks to tighten his grip on the Democrats’ presidential nomination.  Will Warren help unite progressives? Warren’s silence has been notable. As a crush of establishment Democrats raced to line up behind Biden, the fiery progressive senator has refused to endorse her closest ideological ally, Sanders. There was obvious tension between Warren and Sanders during the primary, yet the same could be said of the many moderate candidates who are now standing behind Biden. Every day Warren sits on the sidelines hurts Sanders. He desperately needs a united progressive wing to defeat Biden, yet key pieces of Warren’s coalition are holding back until she makes her move. This is the kind of decision that could have dramatic short- and long-term consequences for the progressive movement. How will a two-man debate change things? There have never been fewer than six Democrats on the debate stage at one time in the 2020 primary season. Next Sunday in Arizona, there will be just two. And in case you missed it, neither is a woman or a person of color or under the age of 77. There are clear ideological differences, of course. Despite Biden and Sanders’ superficial similarities, the silver-haired septuagenarians will face off representing starkly different views of the future of the Democratic Party and the nation. Sanders thinks he’ll benefit from having more time to delve into issues of substance. And with more than four decades in Washington, Biden has a long record to answer for. There will be an unmistakably new dynamic on stage that may give voters their best glimpse so far of how each candidate would perform in a one-on-one debate with President Donald Trump this fall. Can Trump handle the coronavirus outbreak? The Republican president is facing the greatest leadership test of his first term. And, so far, Trump is struggling to grasp basic facts about the rapidly escalating coronavirus threat, which has infected hundreds of Americans across 34 states and counting. That’s even as he and his administration publicly declared last week that the virus was contained. And beyond public health, the economic fallout could be disastrous. Wall Street just suffered its worst week in more than a decade, and travel companies are bracing for massive losses. The general election is just eight months away. Trump needs to show he can lead the country through this growing crisis or face the consequences in November. ___ THE FINAL THOUGHT There’s no need to panic, but the coronavirus threatens to shape American life in 2020 far more than some expected. Public officials are planning for the likelihood that professional sports will be played in empty arenas. Airlines have begun canceling flights. And schools are being closed. It’s fair to wonder whether political events may be curtailed sooner rather than later. Even if the death toll remains relatively low, this epidemic may affect all of us in some way before it’s over.  ___ 2020 Watch runs every Monday and provides a look at the week ahead in the 2020 election. ___ Follow Peoples at https://twitter.com/sppeoples. ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.”",2020 Watch: Can Bernie get back on track in Michigan?,2020-03-09T09:22:33Z,https://apnews.com/64ca7770f30c62a742557fff64725cb8,AP
"DETROIT (AP) — Ask Arlene Williams about President Donald Trump’s promises to bring back auto industry jobs that have evaporated across Michigan and she’ll point with irony to the Chevy Blazer. General Motors is now remaking the iconic American SUV after a lengthy hiatus — but building parts of it in Mexico and elsewhere overseas. “These are some of the staple brands and yes, they’re back,” said Williams, 49, who works at a GM plant in Romulus, Michigan, southwest of Detroit. “They’re just not being made in the U.S.”  The largest of six states voting Tuesday, Michigan could redefine a Democratic primary that has become a showdown between former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. But many voters are already looking ahead to November and whether Trump can again win in the state that perhaps more than any other catapulted him into the White House in 2016.  For Sanders, the stakes could hardly be higher. He defeated Hillary Clinton in Michigan in 2016, emboldening his argument that he could win with a diverse coalition that drew well from young voters, working-class whites and African Americans. But it is the kind of victory he has not been able to replicate this time, and if he does not on Tuesday, any chances at the Democratic nomination may be greatly diminished. Biden has been emphasizing the Obama administration’s bailout of the auto industry, which provided an economic lifeline for GM and Chrysler and federal loans for Ford, likely saving thousands of jobs. He is also counting on continued strong support among African American voters. How Michigan votes will also be clarifying for November. Some see Sanders’ sweeping promises to cancel student debt and provide health care for all potentially energizing young voters but not older ones wary of his democratic socialist ideology. Centrist and safe, Biden could do exactly the opposite, though.  Others worry that both candidates are taking black Democrats for granted. All that may add up to neither being able to carry the state against Trump.  “There’s not a lot of energy, not enough energy, I would say, even for the primary,” said Michigan state Rep. Sherry Gay-Dagnogo, whose district includes a large swath of northwest Detroit. She said the Democratic Party continues to use the same playbook of waiting until the last minute to do intensive community outreach — which crippled it in 2016.  Indeed, major party turnout in Wayne County, which encompasses Detroit and is strongly African American, fell by more than 64,000 votes in 2016 as compared to 2012. That’s especially important since Trump leveled the Democrats’ famed “blue wall” with narrow wins in states that were supposed to comfortably go to Hillary Clinton: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, which he won by just 10,704 votes out more than 4.8 million cast.  Tuesday will be the first test of Democrats’ ability to take them back.  They already can point to hopeful signs. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who has endorsed Biden and been mentioned as a possible vice presidential pick, won in 2018, as fellow Democrat and Sen. Debbie Stabenow was cruising to re-election. Veteran Michigan pollster Bernie Porn said the president remains unpopular with independents and Republican women, especially in the suburbs — though he said Trump’s standing has recovered some in the wake of impeachment.  “I think Trump is in trouble,” Porn said.  Flipping the state back could be built on gains in places like Grand Rapids, childhood home of Gerald Ford and long the epitome of country club Republicans, often most interested in fiscal conservatism but also closely watching social issues. It has begun moving to the left amid an influx of jobs bringing new residents from other parts of the state and the country, Porn said.  Sanders staged a rally Sunday in Grand Rapids and — vowing to grow the Democratic electorate by winning over young, minority and working-class voters — hit the University of Michigan and blue-collar Flint and Dearborn, home to a large concentration of Arab Americans. It is a promise he has made in other states during the primaries, but so far has largely failed to deliver. “I am more than aware that Trump in 2016 won the state of Michigan by a small vote,” Sanders said. “I do believe the people of Michigan aren’t going to make that mistake again.” Sanders canceled a planned trip to Mississippi to spend more time in the state this past weekend. But he has struggled to broaden his appeal with black voters, as evidenced by Biden’s wipe-out win in South Carolina and across many other Southern states on Super Tuesday.  Activist Monica Lewis-Patrick, president and CEO of We the People Detroit, said the eventual nominee will need a strong ground game in Detroit to prevent the same mistakes the party made in 2016, when the black community felt largely unseen and ignored. She has endorsed Sanders. Citing the ongoing water crisis in Flint and Detroit’s aggressive water shutoff campaign that has disrupted service for 100,000-plus residential accounts across the city since 2014, Lewis-Patrick said the party needs to speak to issues that are impacting lives on a daily basis. “We’ve told every candidate before we got down to the final two that we noticed in the debates when they came to Detroit that was missing from the conversation,” she said, referring to when the city hosted Democratic presidential debates last summer. “What we’re seeing is that many campaigns are treating black and brown communities as sort of a drive-by vote.” Sanders has spoken to Flint’s water problems and the shutoff issue, asking with exasperation, “How is it possible” that people in parts of the state “don’t have water coming out of the tap?” In an attempt to shore up its position no matter who wins the nomination, the Michigan Democratic Party has had staff on the ground since 2017 in “pivot” counties that supported Obama in 2012 but went to Trump last presidential cycle. It also has led campaigns highlighting Trump’s “broken promises” when it comes to issues like restoring lost manufacturing jobs.  Still, Gay-Dagnogo said that, though the state Democratic Party opened 15 offices around Michigan, ”it’s no secret” Trump’s reelection campaign has stood up its own operations in the same areas.  “I think sometimes we just wait for something magical to happen, opposed to making sure that there are financial resources in the community to get people out,” she said.  Trump, meanwhile, has visited Michigan several times as president and points to a strong national economy as proof he kept his kept his promises to restore the state’s lost jobs.  Manufacturing jobs in Michigan grew from 616,800 when Trump took office to 628,900 last December, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But some counties that Trump won have experienced job losses, and the state faces the prospect of further downturns as coronavirus reverberates through the economy.  While top union leaders have lined up to support either Biden or Sanders, many of their rank-and-file members continue to back Trump because of his views on social issues like guns and abortion.  “A number of union households who voted for Trump and voted against their own economic interests, I think, may do that again,” said Matt Vitiote, Democratic Party chairman in Monroe County near the Michigan-Ohio border, which twice supported Obama but voted for Trump in 2016.  Williams, who noted the Chevy Blazer’s international flavor, is backing Sanders and his promise to strengthen union membership nationwide. She concedes that Michigan’s economy has grown under Trump but hopes it won’t be enough for him to win the state again.  “I don’t see that there has been real growth in higher-paying jobs,” Williams said. “There have been jobs created, but they’re low-paying jobs and you’ve got to have two or three of them in order to raise your family.” ___ Associated Press writer David Eggert in Lansing, Mich., contributed to this report. ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.”",Dems look to Michigan primary as testing ground for November,2020-03-09T04:57:41Z,https://apnews.com/8ced60306a04eef53418f2ce6f262115,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — It was a blunt warning about the dangers of youth vaping: Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr announced late last month that his state had joined 38 others to investigate whether Juul Labs, the nation’s largest electronic cigarette company, promoted and sold its nicotine-heavy products to teens. It was a moment Juul had worked to avoid. Ten months earlier, a team of Juul representatives met with Carr and his senior staff. They delivered a 17-page presentation laden with information about the public health potential of Juul’s combustion-free vaping devices for adult smokers and the company’s “commitment to ending youth use,” a pledge that included more rigorous retail and online sales controls. Juul had access, but it did not pay off. In that way, the company’s experience in Georgia was typical. Again and again, the company met with Carr and other state attorneys general, in many cases giving money to their campaign funds. But again and again, it was stymied in its efforts to forestall legal action. The session in Carr’s Atlanta offices and meetings with other state AGs haven’t been previously reported. The Associated Press uncovered the influence campaign by reviewing Juul’s political donations and obtaining internal emails, meeting minutes and company records through open records requests to more than a dozen state attorneys general offices. The documents shed new light on the unusual connection Juul forged with Iowa’s Tom Miller, the longest-serving state attorney general in U.S. history. The records show that Miller served as a behind-the-scenes adviser, helping the company respond to media requests and inquiries from government officials. Miller did not receive campaign contributions from Juul. The documents also provide new details about the advocacy roles that the former attorneys general of Massachusetts and Rhode Island have played for the company, including lobbying state officials. All three would become important messengers as Juul stressed its efforts to keep its products away from minors while simultaneously pitching its technology as an anti-smoking tool.  Juul’s political action committee made thousands of dollars in campaign contributions to individual state attorneys general, several of whom like Carr later met with the company’s representatives, according to the records. Katie Byrd, Carr’s spokeswoman, said a $3,000 contribution Juul’s PAC made to Carr’s 2018 reelection campaign wasn’t a factor in his decision to accept the meeting. The company also donated $50,000 each to the Republican and Democratic fundraising committees that support the election of attorneys general candidates. Those donations won Juul corporate membership in both groups, a status that came with invitations to semiannual retreats and conferences attended by attorneys general and their staff. These events provide opportunities for companies to lobby state officials.  The face time with state officials hasn’t prevented scrutiny, however. So far nine states have filed lawsuits against Juul and more may come in the wake of the 39-state investigation, which also is examining whether the company made misleading claims about the nicotine content in its devices. In an emailed response to written questions, a Juul spokesman declined to say how many state attorneys general company representatives have met with. Juul, the spokesman said, is working to earn “the trust of society by working cooperatively with attorneys general, regulators” and other officials to combat teen vaping and to steer adult smokers away from cigarettes. The spokesman said Juul reached out to Miller and donated to other attorneys general to “listen and learn” from them on a range of issues, including cracking down on counterfeit vaping products. Teen use of e-cigarettes has skyrocketed more than 70% since Juul’s launch in 2015, leading the Food and Drug Administration to declare an epidemic of underage vaping among teenagers. Health experts fear this unprecedented increase has hooked a generation of young people on nicotine, a highly addictive drug that is harmful to the developing brain. More than 1 in 4 high schoolers now reports vaping and Juul is the top brand, preferred by 60 percent of students, according to the latest government data.  “Juul really created this crisis,” said Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former Food and Drug Administration commissioner. “Juul created the pool of nicotine-addicted teens and I think they popularized the idea of vaping among kids.” During Gottleib’s tenure, the FDA raided Juul’s San Francisco headquarters, seizing more than 1,000 documents related to the company’s early sales and marketing efforts, including online promotions featuring young models and celebrities on social media sites like Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.  Juul’s meteoric rise has been followed by a hasty retreat in recent months, amid a nationwide backlash over vaping. Although Juul remains the dominant player in the multibillion-dollar e-cigarette market, the company has made several concessions such as pulling its mint, fruit and creme flavors from the market. The company currently sells only menthol and tobacco nicotine pods. Juul also has shuttered its social media presence and halted all U.S. advertising. The FDA and a congressional oversight panel continue to investigate whether the company targeted young people with the flavors, design and advertising of its products.  Yet Juul may face an even bigger threat from state attorneys general, most of whom are elected independently and have broad discretion to investigate and litigate. They’re especially formidable when they band together. Dozens of them did in the 1990s with litigation against tobacco companies that led to an historic $206 billion settlement and new marketing rules that continue to govern how the industry operates. More recently, nearly all states have sued opioid drugmakers and distributors for their alleged role in the addiction epidemic tied to prescription painkillers. “It means they’re in a world of hurt,” James Tierney, a former attorney general of Maine who now teaches at Harvard Law School, said of the multistate investigation. “The states are not buying what Juul is selling, and they’re saying, ‘We need to go deeper.’” The latest of the nine state lawsuits against Juul was filed last month by Massachusetts’ chief legal officer, Maura Healey. Citing company records, she alleges that Juul bought advertisements on seventeen.com, nickjr.com, the cartoonnetwork.com and other websites designed for teens and children. Most of the state lawsuits similarly allege that Juul adopted the playbook of Big Tobacco by luring teens with colorful, youth-oriented ads, “launch parties” and product giveaways. But to date, Juul hasn’t faced the same type of coordinated, multi-state lawsuit previously used to target tobacco, pharmaceutical and financial companies. A TOBACCO WARRIOR IN JUUL’S CORNER Juul’s unlikely partnership with Miller, the Iowa attorney general, began in spring 2018 as federal and state health officials grappled with the surging popularity of teen vaping.  A Democrat with more than 37 years in office, Miller frequently mentions his leadership role in forging the 1998 settlement with the tobacco industry. He’s championed vaping’s potential to “save the lives of adult smokers.”  The company sought Miller’s counsel on how to respond to inquiries from government officials and media outlets. And even as more and more teens were vaping, he urged the public not to “overreact.” Portions of Juul’s interactions with Miller were previously reported by Politico and Vice News. By April 2018, Miller’s staff was working to set up a call between the attorney general and Juul’s then-chief administrative officer, Ashley Gould. “He wants a time scheduled with her and put on his calendar,” wrote Miller’s executive secretary, in an email to fellow staffers. Two weeks later Miller’s office issued a press release titled “Juul offers opportunity to reduce smoking rates” highlighting the company’s potential to shift smokers away from cigarettes.  Days after that, Miller announced a more concrete relationship, saying he would advise Juul on how to keep its product away from young people. In a press statement, Miller said underage vaping was a “cause for concern,” but had “not reached panic or epidemic stages.”  Miller’s new role involved organizing a group of experts to advise the company on underage use. Of the 13 experts Miller assembled for the group, more than half were former attorneys general, including ex-officials from Illinois and Arizona, both states that had recently requested documents from the company. Other members of the group included several researchers and one of Miller’s assistants, who would later leave his job to work as a vice president for Juul. The advisory group would hold several conference calls with Juul executives. But one former state official was not sympathetic to Juul’s desire to keep its flavors readily available in stores. “I would support banning the product if you can’t do a better job of keeping it out of the hands of children,” said former Arizona attorney general, Grant Woods, according to meeting minutes from an August call. The group held its last meeting in October 2018, according to Miller’s office. Throughout the summer, Juul frequently reached out to Miller as negative press accounts of teenagers addicted to Juul’s flavored nicotine pods began to appear. In one email to Miller’s secretary, a Juul executive requested time to discuss interview requests from “three top-tier reporters” who had contacted the company. “I’d love to involve AG Miller but wanted to get your thoughts before I sent the reporters your way,” wrote Juul spokeswoman Victoria Davis. In the following weeks, Juul would seek Miller’s input or encourage him to field inquiries from The New York Times, CBS’ “60 Minutes” and NBC. In April 2019, a positive profile of Juul co-founders James Monsees and Adam Bowen penned by Miller appeared in Time magazine’s annual list of the 100 most influential people.  In an interview with AP, Miller said he became involved with the company to help “bring them into compliance” by stopping underage sales of their products and to reduce the toll of smoking on adults.  “If you were going to deal with the question of kids and e-cigarettes, you had to deal with Juul,” Miller said.  Miller rejected any suggestions that Juul benefited from its association with him and said he wouldn’t hesitate to take legal action against the company if evidence shows wrongdoing.  Miller’s office hasn’t joined the multistate investigation of Juul.  Anthony Johnstone, a former assistant attorney general for Montana, said there is little precedent for such a close partnership. “That depth of involvement by an AG with a single corporation at the center of a public health issue is uncharacteristic,” he said. MONEY AND MEETINGS In mid-2018, as other states began to eye Juul more critically, the company gave $50,000 each to the Democratic Attorneys General Association and its GOP counterpart, the Republican Attorneys General Association, according to financial reports both groups filed with the IRS. The organizations raise money and back candidates from their respective parties that are running for the office. Neither of the groups discloses how they disperse corporate donations to candidates. Those contributions and others would be followed by meetings with at least five state attorney generals, documents obtained through open records requests show. One of those meetings came in September 2018, when Juul representatives met with Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro and four of his staffers for nearly two hours to discuss how to to stop young people from using the company’s products. Shapiro’s office had called for Juul to pull its fruit and dessert flavors from the market and reduce the high nicotine levels of its e-cigarettes. Yet the company declared these weren’t bugs, but features that adult smokers wanted, according to an eight-page memo written by a Juul executive that recounted the conversation. A spokeswoman for Shapiro said members of his staff “meet with companies to discuss potential violations of the laws” and to see if they will correct them. Last month Shapiro announced that Pennsylvania would sue Juul for allegedly misleading the public about the addictiveness of its e-cigarettes. In late October 2018, Juul’s political action committee donated more than $38,000 to incumbent state attorneys general and one first-time candidate for the office, according to a review of campaign finance records. By then, Juul was squarely in the crosshairs of FDA regulators, who were sounding the alarm on teen vaping after survey data showed e-cigarette use among high school students had jumped nearly 80% in the past year.  Not everyone wanted Juul’s money. Kwame Raoul, a Democrat elected in November 2018 to his first term as Illinois’ attorney general, rebuffed a $3,000 gift from Juul. Hanah Jubeh, a spokeswoman for Raoul’s campaign, said the contribution conflicted with his professional responsibilities and personal views. Raoul’s office announced in December it was suing Juul. South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson announced last month that he’d joined the 39-state probe of Juul to examine whether the company “is following the law and not misleading people with false or misleading claims.” Previously, Wilson’s reelection campaign had accepted a $3,000 donation from Juul’s PAC and he’d met with company representatives in February 2019.  Wilson spokesman Robert Kittle said Juul’s contribution had no bearing on the decision to grant the meeting. HIRED HANDS Juul enlisted two former state attorneys general, Patrick Lynch and Martha Coakley, as the company stepped up its outreach to current occupants of the office. Lynch was Rhode Island’s chief legal officer from 2003 to 2010 while Coakley was the attorney general of Massachusetts from 2007 to 2015. Lynch runs a consulting firm that promotes its ability to help clients like Juul “build relationships and tailor communications” with state attorneys general around the country. When Juul executives agreed to allow Marlboro cigarette-maker Altria to buy a 35% stake in their company for nearly $13 billion, Lynch sent a letter on Juul’s behalf to state attorneys general explaining that his client would “remain fully independent and entirely focused” on its mission to help smokers, despite the investment from the nation’s biggest cigarette maker.  Lynch’s office did not return repeated calls and emails seeking comment. Juul hired Coakley to be its vice president of government affairs in April 2019. A month later she was among the Juul representatives that met with Chris Carr, the Georgia attorney general. While in office, Coakley joined more than three dozen other attorneys general in writing a letter to the FDA that called for the “immediate regulatory oversight of e-cigarettes, an increasingly widespread, addictive product.”  She has a very different role now. Coakley helps to “educate state officials, regulators and organizations on Juul’s commitment to combating underage use and transitioning adult smokers from combustible cigarettes,” the company said. Her replacement as Massachusetts attorney general, Maura Healey, has a very different opinion of Juul. “We are going to make them pay for the public health crisis they caused in Massachusetts,” Healey said upon announcing her lawsuit against the company last month.  ___ Follow the reporters on Twitter: Matthew Perrone @AP_FDAwriter and Richard Lardner @rplardner",Juul Labs sought to court AGs as teen vaping surged,2020-03-09T05:18:02Z,https://apnews.com/c148a2866cd4e2948552402c8d3b62cc,AP
"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden worshiped at a predominantly African American church in Mississippi two days before the state’s primary, in which black voters will play a pivotal role.  Rival Bernie Sanders was campaigning Sunday roughly 900 miles (1,450 kilometers) to the north in Michigan, the biggest prize among the six states voting Tuesday. The Vermont senator was looking to bolster his own appeal with African Americans by announcing the endorsement of civil rights icon the Rev. Jesse Jackson.  Biden was welcomed by applause at New Hope Baptist Church, where he was accompanied by the NAACP national president, Derrick Johnson, and by U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, both of whom are from Mississippi. They sat in the front row, and Biden sang along with the congregation: “Oh, victory in Jesus, my savior forever.” Thompson endorsed the former vice president on Thursday and introduced him to the congregation. “We know what it means to be picked out, to be picked on,” Thompson said. “We know Joe. I’m going to give him another name.” He called Biden “the comeback kid.” Biden had struggled in the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, where Sanders emerged as the front-runner, but won decisively in South Carolina on Feb. 29, boosted by African American voters. He also had a strong showing on Super Tuesday in states with large numbers of black voters. “If I am the comeback kid, which I ain’t there yet, but if I’m the comeback kid, there’s only one reason I’ve come back — the African American community all around the country,” Biden said to applause by the congregation. Biden mentioned former President Barack Obama several times. He said the United States is at “an inflection point” because of poor treatment in the past three years of people who are marginalized, isolated and oppressed. Obama’s name also came up at a Sanders rally Sunday in the West Michigan city of Grand Rapids — but under very circumstances. The senator and Jackson appeared together before thousands of cheering supporters at a downtown plaza and Sanders said Jackson “has broken down more barriers than others can even dream of” while blazing a path against racism that helped propel Obama to the White House.  “If there was no Jesse Jackson, in my view, there never would have been a President Barack Obama,” Sanders said. “Let me just say to Rev. Jackson: It’s one of the honors of my life to be supported by a man who has put his life on the line for the last 50 years fighting for justice,” he added.  Jackson and Obama’s relationship has not been without its past issues, including in 2008, when Jackson apologized for saying Obama had been “talking down to black people.” Addressing the Michigan rally, Jackson stayed focused on Sanders, saying, “I stand with Bernie Sanders today because he stood with me,” and adding that the senator “never lost taste for justice for people.” Sanders upset Hillary Clinton during Michigan’s Democratic primary in 2016 and noted that Jackson won the state during his own bid in the 1988 presidential primary. “Tuesday, there is going to be a very, very important primary here in Michigan,” Sanders said. “Back in 1988, Jesse Jackson won the state. In 2016, I won the state. And, on Tuesday, if we stick together, we bring our friends out to vote, we’re gonna win it again.” Back in Mississippi, Biden talked about the 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. “I underestimated that hate’s never defeated. It only hides,” Biden said. Daisy Carter, 75, attended the church service where Biden spoke, and said afterward that she is enthusiastically supporting him and will ask others to vote for him, too.  “He was Obama’s right hand, and Obama was our man,” said Carter, who is African American and is retired as a Head Start purchasing agent. She said it is important to defeat President Donald Trump, and she thinks Biden can do that. Speaking of Biden, she said: “I feel at home with him.”  Actress Vivica A. Fox and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick spoke to a racially diverse crowd Sunday at a get-out-the-vote rally for Biden at historically black Tougaloo College in Jackson. “Joe had President Obama’s back for every minute of those eight years in office,” said Fox, who also campaigned for Biden in South Carolina before that state’s primary.  As Jackson was endorsing Sanders, meanwhile, Biden picked up the coveted endorsement of California Sen. Kamala Harris, who said she would “do everything in my power″ to help elect the former vice president. She is the latest dropout from the Democratic race for president to line up behind Biden in his matchup against Sanders. On Monday, former presidential candidate Sen. Cory Booker also endorsed Biden, further solidifying the Democratic establishment’s move to close circles around Biden after his Super Tuesday success.  Despite that, Jackson said he chose Sanders after the campaign offered responses on 13 issues Jackson raised, including protecting voting rights, increasing funding for historically black colleges and universities and committing to putting African Americans on the Supreme Court, according to a statement released by the Sanders’ campaign. He also said Biden’s campaign hadn’t approached him about an endorsement but Sanders’ did.  Speaking at the rally, Jackson brushed aside some voters’ uneasiness about Sanders’ avowed democratic socialist ideology, saying Sanders will defend democratic values and that issues important to poor and minority people wouldn’t have been prioritized in the presidential race without him.  “Thank God for Bernie Sanders,” Jackson said.  ___ Weissert reported from Grand Rapids, Michigan. ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.”","Biden in Mississippi, Sanders in Michigan before primaries",2020-03-08T17:27:35Z,https://apnews.com/e7be191b236552ce1b116b4cba6544ab,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — As the stock market convulses, airline schedules buckle and businesses worry their overseas supply lines will snap, President Donald Trump is looking on the sunny side of an economy clouded by the coronavirus. For weeks he’s played down the consequences of the public health emergency and also misleadingly played up his poll ratings even as his agencies scramble to manage the crisis. Now he’s suggesting that a robust jobs report might be explained in part by the prospect that Americans are hunkering down and focusing more of their spending in their own country. There’s no evidence that the virus has juiced jobs. Trump’s plentiful and sometimes inaccurate comments on the outbreak this past week prompted the chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., to suggest that Trump and Vice President Mike Pence stand back and “let the experts do the talking.” Trump paid that advice no heed. A sampling of recent rhetoric on the virus and other matters and reality: CORONAVIRUS TRUMP, asked about his administration’s handling of the coronavirus after missteps in distributing test kits: “We’ve gotten the highest poll numbers of anybody for this kind of thing.” — Fox News town hall Thursday in Scranton, Pennsylvania. TRUMP: “Gallup just gave us the highest rating ever for the way we are handling the CoronaVirus situation.” — tweet Thursday. THE FACTS: He’s misrepresenting poll findings from Gallup to suggest public approval even after government missteps on the coronavirus. In fact, the poll was conducted weeks before, in early to mid-February, during the beginning stages of the U.S. outbreak. It was before anyone had died from COVID-19 or the first cases of community transmission surfaced. The Gallup poll, conducted Feb. 3-16, found 77% of Americans were very confident (31%) or somewhat confident (46%) that the U.S. government would be able to handle a virus outbreak. That tracks closely with a poll conducted Feb. 13-16 by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, which also found about 3 in 4 Americans were at least moderately confident that U.S. health officials could handle the job. Gallup also reported Americans were more confident than they were in previous administrations’ ability to deal with Zika, Ebola, swine flu and bird flu, based on an average of polls during those times. But the coronavirus polls were conducted when deaths from COVID-19 were still happening abroad, rather than on U.S. soil. Since then, Trump appointed Vice President Mike Pence on Feb. 26 to lead the coronavirus response as the U.S. stock market slid over epidemic fears and the first U.S. cases emerged of community transmission that didn’t involve overseas travel.  To date, there are now at least 21 U.S. deaths and more than 500 infections scattered over more than 30 states as the federal government struggles to meet demand for diagnostic testing kits. ___ TRUMP: “We’re going to have Americans staying home instead of going and spending the money in other countries. And maybe that’s one of the reasons the job numbers are so good.” — remarks to the press Friday. THE FACTS: That is not one of the reasons the job numbers are so good.  The government’s report Friday showing employers added a healthy 273,000 jobs last month was compiled before the coronavirus had spread through multiple states.  Even so, the report showed employment at hotels was flat. Restaurant hiring jumped by more than 50,000, but most economists attributed that to relatively warm weather. Now, with many businesses restricting their employees’ travel, airlines are already getting hit: United Airlines said Wednesday it has instituted a hiring freeze. Trump is probably correct that fewer Americans will go abroad and spend money while the outbreak is active. The flip side is that fewer foreigners may come to the U.S. and spend their money here. ___ WHITE HOUSE: “The President is no longer traveling to Atlanta today. The CDC has been proactive and prepared since the very beginning and the President does not want to interfere with the CDC’s mission to protect the health and welfare of their people and the agency.” — statement Friday about Trump’s planned visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. THE FACTS: Actually, the White House rationale for canceling the trip was contradicted a short time later by Trump, who said he postponed because a CDC employee in Atlanta was thought to have contracted the infectious disease and “because of the one person, they didn’t want me going.” It was not about staying out of the way of CDC employees, He said it turned out that the person was not infected. He visited the CDC after all. ___ TRUMP: “A lot of people will have this, and it’s very mild. They will get better very rapidly. They don’t even see a doctor ... So, if we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work — some of them go to work, but they get better.” – Fox News interview Wednesday. TRUMP: “I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work. This is just more Fake News.” — tweet Thursday. THE FACTS: He seems to be suggesting that people with COVID-19 can go to work if they have minor symptoms, contradicting the guidance of his federal health officials. Regardless of how sick people may or may not feel, people are advised to stay home. The CDC states  that people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 who do not need hospitalization should restrict their activities and “stay home except to get medical care.” “Do not go to work, school or public areas,” it states.  ___ TRUMP, on developing tests for coronavirus in patients: “The Obama administration made a decision on testing that turned out to be very detrimental to what we’re doing. And we undid that decision a few days ago so that the testing can take place in a much more accurate and rapid fashion.” — Wednesday at the White House. VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: “The last administration asserted FDA jurisdiction over testing and the development of tests like this. ... The president changed that on Saturday so that now, as I spoke to several governors this morning, the states now have the ability to actually conduct the coronavirus test in state labs, university laboratories.” — Wednesday at the White House. TRUMP: “And now we have tremendous flexibility. Many, many more sites. Many, many more people. And you couldn’t have had that under the Obama rule, and we ended that rule very quickly.” — Wednesday. THE FACTS: They’re trying to blame Barack Obama for something his administration didn’t do. It’s not true that an Obama-era rule limited laboratories run by companies, universities and hospitals from developing and running tests for the coronavirus during an emergency. No such regulation existed. The Trump administration’s action last Saturday only undid a policy that its own Food and Drug Administration put in place. The new action lets labs develop and use coronavirus diagnostic tests before the agency reviews them. Previously, the FDA had only authorized use of a government test developed by the CDC. FDA guidance drafted during the Obama administration called for tighter regulation of so-called laboratory-developed tests, a market traditionally not overseen by the agency. But that guidance was not brought into effect. Even if it had been, it would not have applied to public health emergencies such as the coronavirus. ___ TRUMP: “We’re talking about a vaccine. Maybe a cure is possible. But we’re talking about a vaccine and they’re moving along very quickly, all of the pharmaceutical companies, are moving along very quickly.” — remarks on March 2.  TRUMP: The U.S. may have a vaccine “relatively soon” and “something that makes you feel better ... sooner.” — North Carolina rally on March 2. THE FACTS: That’s misleading, given the far more cautious pronouncements of federal public health officials and scientists. They say a vaccine is probably more than a year away at best and there are no special treatments for COVID-19. The notion of a quick “cure” is not in their vocabulary as they focus on trying to help people avoid getting the disease in the first place. What’s actually happening: Studies have begun in COVID-19 patients in parts of the world to see if certain antiviral medications could help treat the infection.  Today, there are no proven treatments. In China, scientists have been testing a combination of HIV drugs against the new coronavirus, as well as an experimental drug named remdesivir that was in development to fight Ebola. In the U.S., the University of Nebraska Medical Center also began testing remdesivir in some Americans who were found to have COVID-19 after being evacuated from a cruise ship in Japan. It’s not known how soon such studies will answer whether any of the drugs help. And many patients recover without needing any treatment. The biggest concern is how to help the fraction who become severely ill.  ___ TRUMP: The U.S. is “ranked by far No. 1 in the world for preparedness” — North Carolina rally. THE FACTS: Not “by far.” He’s referring to a report coauthored by Johns Hopkins Centers for Health Security. Hopkins experts last week said the U.S. got a “grade” that overall was highest by a few points among a variety of high-income countries that are all at about the same level of preparedness. But the report’s overall finding: “No country is fully prepared for an epidemic or pandemic,” cautioned Hopkins’ Jennifer Nuzzo, who coauthored the report. It’s difficult to say from the report that a country that scores two points higher than another is going to fare much better, she added. In the U.S., the biggest worry is access to that health care. “If fear of the cost of health care is a deterrent, that could create a bad situation where people stay at home, potentially infecting others,” she said. ___ HEALTH CARE TRUMP: “Preexisting conditions, 100% we take care of.” — Fox News town-hall show Thursday. THE FACTS: Far from it. People who have medical problems or a history of them are protected in the health insurance marketplace because of Obama’s Affordable Care Act, which Trump is trying to dismantle in and out of court. When Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum challenged Trump’s familiar and false assurance about preexisting protections, Trump obliquely acknowledged he has not delivered on his promise —and apparently won’t before the election. Republicans have “all pledged” that people with preexisting conditions will have their insurance protected, he said, but for that to happen, “we have to hold the Senate. We have to get the House. We have to, obviously, keep the White House.” ___ VETERANS TRUMP: “We got Choice. Nobody thought we were going to get Choice. They‘ve been trying to get Choice for over 40 years.” — Fox News interview Wednesday. THE FACTS: Yet another false telling of how the program to let some veterans get private health care at public expense came about. It’s a staple of his rhetoric. The Choice program was achieved by Obama. Trump expanded some of the conditions for qualifying for it. ___ Associated Press polling director Emily Swanson, and AP writers Matthew Perrone, Lauran Neergaard, Christopher Rugaber and Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar contributed to this report. ___ EDITOR’S NOTE — A look at the veracity of claims by political figures. ___  Find AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd  Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck",AP FACT CHECK: Trump's rosy take on govt's handling of virus,2020-03-09T05:01:34Z,https://apnews.com/0afe0883f14ca85a676c323c277dbf3a,AP
"GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) — As the coronavirus hits more states, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said Sunday his campaign is gauging when it may become necessary to cancel the large campaign rallies that public health experts say could be breeding grounds to spread the potentially deadly illness. “Obviously what is most important to us is to protect the health of the American people,” Sanders said as he appeared in a series of TV interviews. “And what I will tell you, we are talking to public health officials all over this country.” “This is an issue that every organization, every candidate has got to deal with,” he said.  Federal health authorities have been advising older people and those with medical conditions, in particular, to avoid crowded spaces, prompting the cancellation of music and arts festivals and other events around the country. On Sunday, Surgeon General Jerome Adams noted that the average age of death for people from the coronavirus is 80, while for those needing medical attention, it is 60. But that so far hasn’t led President Donald Trump or his two remaining major Democratic rivals, Sanders and Joe Biden, to cut back on big campaign events. Each man is in his 70s. Sanders said “in the best of all possible worlds” the three candidates should probably limit their travel and avoid crowds, “but right now, we’re running as hard as we can.” Sanders planned a meeting Monday in Detroit with public health experts and others to discuss the outbreak. The Biden campaign said Sunday the former vice president was following the guidance of state and federal health experts on the outbreak, but there were no planned changes to his campaign activities. Trump on Saturday said he wasn’t worried about the coronavirus getting closer to the White House after the first case in the nation’s capital was confirmed over the weekend. Officials also said an attendee of a recent political conference where Trump himself had spoken also tested positive for the virus. “No, I’m not concerned at all. No, I’m not. We’ve done a great job,” Trump said.  Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said Sunday the campaign is proceeding as normal. “We announce rallies when we are ready to announce rallies,” he said. “The consideration is always the president’s schedule and what states the president wants to target.” Adams, acknowledging Trump’s busy public schedule, said for many Americans “life can’t stop” and that ultimately the goal was to minimize risk the best as possible. “But speaking of being at risk, the president, he sleeps less than I do, and he’s healthier than what I am,” he said. “And so that’s the other reason that this messaging is hard, because there are 70-year-olds who run marathons and are healthier than some 30-year-olds.”  “If people are going to go out there, we want them to be extra cautious — we want them to wash their hands frequently,” Adams said. The U.S. death toll from the virus has climbed to at least 21, with all but three victims in Washington state. The number of infections swelled to more than 500, scattered across the U.S. Still, concerns about the spreading virus haven’t stopped thousands from thronging campaign rallies in recent days.  At a Trump rally last week in Charlotte, North Carolina, the virus threat didn’t deter enthusiastic fans who shared buckets of chicken fingers in the stands and dunked their hands into shared vats of popcorn while they awaited the president’s arrival. Sanders drew more than 7,000 to a convention hall in downtown Detroit on Friday night and his campaign said 15,000 people attended his rally in Chicago’s Grant Park on Saturday.  Mercedes Lopez, a 56-year-old who owns a restaurant in Grand Rapids and attended an open-air Sanders rally in the city’s downtown on Sunday, said she’s not afraid of the virus. She said she sees the government’s increased concern as a plot to distract the electorate from other, negative things that are occurring, such as increasing petty crime and official corruption.  “There’s a virus but it’s not at the level they are saying. It’s to distract people,” Lopez said.  Lopez added that she wasn’t worried about attending an event with such a large group, saying, “I’m calm. I’m not going to worry about it because the more you think about, ‘I’m going to protect myself against this one thing or this other thing,’ it becomes impossible. You can’t protect yourself from everything.”  Sanders appeared on CNN’s “State of the Union,” NBC’s “Meet the Press,” and ABC’s “This Week,” and Adams spoke on CNN and CBS’ “Face the Nation.” ___ Yen reported from Washington.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — Two members of Congress, Sen. Ted Cruz and Rep. Paul Gosar, said Sunday they are isolating themselves after determining they had contact at a political conference with a man who has tested positive for coronavirus. Cruz, R-Texas, said he had brief contact with the man at the Conservative Political Action Conference nearly two weeks ago and would spend the next few days at his home in Texas until a full 14 days had passed since their interaction. Gosar, R-Ariz., said he had sustained contact with the man at CPAC and that he and three members of his senior staff were under self-quarantine. His office will be closed for the week, Gosar said in a tweet. Besides Cruz and Gosar, the CPAC schedule listed three other senators and 12 House members who were scheduled to speak. They included No. 2 House GOP leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana, No. 3 Republican leader Liz Cheney of Wyoming and congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina, who has since become the White House chief of staff.￼￼ Also on the schedule was Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Both President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence spoke at CPAC, but the White House said there was no indication that either had met or were in “close proximity” to the infected attendee. Meanwhile, Maryland reported two new cases on Sunday, raising to five the total confirmed cases in the state. Virginia reported its second case. In a separate case of coronavirus, a prominent Episcopal church in Washington, D.C., suspended all activities after announcing that one of its senior leaders was the first person in the nation’s capital to test positive for the virus. The Rev. Timothy Cole, the rector of Christ Church Georgetown, was in stable condition after being hospitalized Saturday night, according to a statement from the Rev. Crystal Hardin, the assistant rector. In an unrelated case, Cruz said he met the man being treated for coronavirus 10 days ago at CPAC in suburban Oxon Hill, Maryland. The Texas Republican said he’s not experiencing any symptoms, feels fine and has been advised by medical authorities that the odds of transmission were extremely low. Yet, Cruz said, out of an abundance of caution he will remain at home in Texas for another few days until a full 14 days have passed since the interaction. He said medical authorities advised him that those who have interacted with him in the last 10 days should not be concerned about potential transmission. David Popp, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky￼., said Sunday evening that no changes have been made in the chamber’s schedule in the wake of Cruz’s decision to remain in Texas. McConnell has spoken with Cruz, Popp said. The Senate has a vote scheduled Monday evening and plans to be in session this week considering energy and possibly other legislation. The Senate and the House are set for a one-week recess the week of March 16. According to Christ Church Georgetown website, Cole has been the rector since September 2016, is married and has two children.  ``Out of an abundance of caution, Christ Church has canceled all activities including church services until further notice. We recommend that concerned community members contact their health care providers,” the statement said.  Officials on Saturday had announced the district’s first positive test, but identified the victim only as a man in his 50s. A second local positive test involves a man who visited the Washington area from Nigeria, but he was being hospitalized in Maryland, Mayor Muriel Bowser said. Health officials said Sunday said they had determined as part of their investigation that “an individual’s visitation to Christ Church Georgetown warrants precautionary measures” and they recommended a temporary halt to services. In response, the church publicly identified Cole as the victim. The Washington mayor’s office said a city high school is staying closed Monday, though no new confirmed coronavirus cases have been reported. Three people who stayed at the same house as the Nigerian man who tested positive in Maryland were tested Sunday and all were negative. But one of them works at School Without Walls High School, which is being kept closed to give staff time to communicate with staff and parents and to clean the school.  In Maryland, a Harford County resident in her 80s who contracted the virus while traveling overseas was hospitalized, officials said. A Montgomery County resident in his 60s who contracted the virus while traveling overseas was briefly hospitalized. Virginia recorded its first case Saturday when a Marine stationed at Fort Belvoir and living at the Quantico base was found to have the virus. On Sunday, Virginia officials announced a second case involving a Fairfax man in his 80s who took a Nile River cruise. Dr. Benjamin Schwartz, director of epidemiology and population health for the Fairfax County health department, said the Fairfax man developed systems of respiratory illness on Feb. 28 and was hospitalized on March 5. He remains hospitalized but is in stable condition and not in an intensive care unit, Schwartz said. “Fortunately, the individual had limited contact with others while ill, and therefore the risk to the general Fairfax community remains low,” said the county’s health director, Dr. Gloria Addo-Ayensa. Virginia state epidemiologist Dr. Lilian Peake said testing for the Fort Belvoir case was done at Walter Reed medical center, and testing for the Fairfax resident was done at a state lab in Richmond. “The two cases are not related,” Peake said. “At this point, there are no signs of the virus spreading in the community in Virginia.” ___ Associated Press writers Randall Chase in Dover, Delaware, and Alan Fram and Robert Burns in Washington contributed to this report.",2 members of Congress say they met man with coronavirus,2020-03-08T19:15:53Z,https://apnews.com/740849680422dc4ce16ca02ea4813867,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — The two top Democratic leaders in Congress are calling on President Donald Trump to support a series of steps to help Americans deal with the coronavirus outbreak — from paid sick leave to widespread and free testing and other moves. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Sunday that Trump should put the health and safety of the public first and such steps should take priority over moves to help companies deal with financial losses — like tax cuts for corporations. “We are demanding that the administration prioritize the health and safety of American workers and their families over corporate interests,” they said in a statement. Among the steps they are pushing: paid sick leave for workers impacted by the quarantine orders or those responsible for caring for children in case of school closures; enhanced unemployment insurance for workers who may lose their jobs because of the outbreak; expansion of food programs to people impacted by coronavirus; and adequate protection for front-line workers in contact with those exposed. Other steps they want are widespread, free coronavirus testing, affordable treatment for all; protections from price gouging; and increased resources in the medical system to respond to increased demands. “The administration must move more quickly and seriously to address the severe impacts of the coronavirus on the financial security of America’s families,” they said.","Pelosi, Schumer: Trump needs to support help for outbreak",2020-03-09T01:09:10Z,https://apnews.com/e7a6b6d3bbef3c78be0f902ff9b27098,AP
"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Democratic legislators in Virginia have dramatically reshaped the state in two months, sweeping aside many of the state’s old business-friendly and socially conservative laws and replacing them with a broad, progressive policy agenda. Lawmakers wrapped up this year’s session Sunday — apart from passing the state budget — after advancing the South’s strictest gun laws, broadest LGBTQ protections and some of its loosest abortion restrictions. Democrats had not had full control of the legislature for more than two decades, and their years of pent-up frustrations yielded one of the most consequential sessions in Virginia’s history. “In November, voters called for swift, impactful action to make their communities safer and more prosperous. We have delivered,” House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn said.  But many Republicans said Democrats had advanced a liberal agenda beyond what the average voter supports while trampling on Virginia’s pro-business reputation. “I think it’s been a fairly devastating year for people that are in rural Virginia,” said Sen. Steve Newman, a Republican who has served in the legislature since the early 1990′s. “It’s not just the high-profile items, but it’s just how deep the far left has reached into the code of Virginia.” An astonishingly large list of topics were covered, with high-profile legislation advancing to Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam’s desk almost daily. Marijuana was decriminalized, insulin prices capped, and voter ID requirements repealed. One immediate priority of Democrats, making Virginia the critical 38th state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, was quickly dispatched in January to the delight of women’s rights advocates, some of whom had worked on the issue for decades.  Virginia briefly became the epicenter of the nation’s gun debate, as tens of thousands of gun owners from around the country took over Capitol Square in January to protest Democrats’ aggressive gun-control push. Long disproportionately made up of white men, the legislature was led by Filler-Corn, the first female House speaker, and had the highest number of African Americans in leadership positions in Virginia’s 400-year history. Black lawmakers sponsored measures that raise the minimum wage, make it easier to vote, repeal decades-old racist language in state code, cap the interest rates on payday loans and make it easier for struggling tenants to avoid evictions.  “We’ve never had this kind of success,” said Del. Lamont Bagby, chairman of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus. “We haven’t had as many bills. And we haven’t had this many significantly important bills.” On criminal justice reform, lawmakers succeeded in raising the felony larceny threshold from $500 to $1,000 and ending the suspension of driver’s licenses over court fines and fees. But several other measures died, including a proposal to legalize marijuana. Lawmakers tackled several issues of statewide impact.  State regulators have said a sweeping renewable energy bill that will make Virginia a national leader on addressing climate change is expected to significantly increase the average customer’s electricity bills. And lawmakers agreed to increase  the gas tax to help alleviate some of Virginia’s notorious traffic problems.  Lawmakers also passed several measures to expand gambling in Virginia, including legalizing casinos, after special interests spent heavily on campaign contributions and lobbyists.  Democrats had plenty of growing pains in their first year in charge, and deep divisions within the party were exposed. Moderate senators complained the more liberal House was rushing through too many big-ticket items. But some House members and others said the new Democratic majority hadn’t lived up to its campaign promises.  “When push comes to shove, they give us, like, crumbs,” said Reuben Chavez, a delivery driver from northern Virginia. He was escorted out of the Senate gallery by police Saturday for yelling “shame” when lawmakers voted not to allow undocumented immigrants to get normal driver’s licenses, but instead created a special new category of IDs called a driver privilege card. The Senate won out in several fights, insisting on more moderate versions of high-profile legislation. A plan to hike the minimum wage to $15 an hour is more gradual and has broader exemptions than what the House wanted, and a public sector collective bargaining measure is far more limited than what the House initially passed.  The Senate also watered down almost all of Northam’s package of gun-control laws and outright rejected his proposed ban on the sale of assault weapons. A fight over redistricting reform was particularly caustic in the House Democratic caucus. Black lawmakers pleaded unsuccessfully with their colleagues not to support a proposed constitutional amendment to create a bipartisan redistricting commission, saying it could hurt minority influence in drawing future legislative and Congressional lines. Lawmakers delayed action on passing a $135 billion two-year state budget in large part over a fight about whether to fund a college tuition freeze. They planned to pass a final budget on Thursday and then return in April to take up the governor’s proposed amendments and vetoes.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — Kamala Harris endorsed Joe Biden on Sunday and said she would “do everything in my power″ to help elect him, becoming the latest dropout from the Democratic race for president to line up behind the former vice president in his battle with Bernie Sanders for the nomination. The decision by the California senator who was one of three black candidates seeking to challenge President Donald Trump further solidifies the Democratic establishment’s move to close circles around Biden after his Super Tuesday success. Her endorsements comes before the next round of primaries, with six states voting Tuesday, including Michigan and Mississippi. Sanders, a Vermont senator, countered with his own major endorsement on Sunday, announcing that civil rights icon Jesse Jackson was formally backing him.  Jackson appeared with Sanders during a campaign stop in Grand Rapids, Michigan. In a statement released by Sanders’ campaign, Jackson said Biden had not reached out to him for endorsement and Sanders had. He also said he chose Sanders after the senator’s campaign offered responses on 13 issues Jackson raised, including protecting voting rights, increasing funding for historically black colleges and universities and committing to putting African Americans on the Supreme Court.  In a statement on Biden, meanwhile, Harris said, “There is no one better prepared than Joe to steer our nation through these turbulent times, and restore truth, honor, and decency to the Oval Office.”  “He is kind and endlessly caring, and he truly listens to the American people,” her statement added. Harris said the United States “is at an inflection point. And the decision voters make this November will shape the country and the world our children and grandchildren will grow up in. I believe in Joe Biden.” Among Biden’s former rivals, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg, Beto O’Rourke, Mike Bloomberg, Tim Ryan, Deval Patrick and John Delaney have endorsed him. Sanders has gotten the endorsement of Marianne Williamson and Bill de Blasio. Also coming out for Biden on Sunday were two prominent Mississippi Democrats, former Gov. Ray Mabus and Mike Espy, agriculture secretary under President Bill Clinton. Espy is also on the ballot Tuesday as he seeks the party’s Senate nomination for the chance to face the Republican incumbent, Cindy Hyde-Smith, in November.  Harris withdrew from the race in December, ending a candidacy with the historic potential of becoming the first black woman elected president. The former California attorney general was seen as a candidate poised to attract the multiracial coalition of voters that sent Barack Obama to the White House. But she ultimately could not craft a message that resonated with voters or secure the money to continue her run.  Biden and Sanders, two white men in their 70s, are now the front-runners for the nomination in what was once a field of candidates that included several woman and much younger politicians. Harris said in her statement that “like many women, I watched with sadness as women exited the race one by one.” Four years after Hillary Clinton was the party’s nominee, “we find ourselves without any woman on a path to be the Democratic nominee for president.” “This is something we must reckon with and it is something I will have more to say about in the future,” she said. “But we must rise to unite the party and country behind a candidate who reflects the decency and dignity of the American people and who can ultimately defeat Donald Trump.″ Biden on Friday won the endorsement of former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, who was one of the black candidates for the nomination. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker hasn’t made a public endorsement yet.  Black voters have anchored Biden’s comeback since disappointing finishes in overwhelmingly white Iowa and New Hampshire in early contests that put his campaign on the brink of collapse.  ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.”",Harris endorses Biden; Jesse Jackson backs Sanders ,2020-03-08T12:54:17Z,https://apnews.com/68fbac6ffb5bc204448b929da0b04596,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is making a misleading boast about his job performance on the coronavirus, claiming that recent polls point to high public approval even after delays by the federal government in distributing test kits to diagnose and stem the illness. TRUMP, asked about his administration’s handling of the coronavirus after missteps in distributing test kits: “We’ve gotten the highest poll numbers of anybody for this kind of thing.” — Fox News town hall Thursday in Scranton, Pennsylvania. TRUMP: “Gallup just gave us the highest rating ever for the way we are handling the CoronaVirus situation. The April 2009-10 Swine Flu, where nearly 13,000 people died in the U.S., was poorly handled.” — tweet Thursday. THE FACTS: He’s misrepresenting poll findings from Gallup to suggest public approval even after government missteps on the coronavirus. In fact, the poll was conducted weeks before, in early to mid-February, during the beginning stages of the U.S. outbreak. It was before anyone had died from COVID-19 or the first cases of community transmission surfaced. The Gallup poll, conducted Feb. 3-16, found 77% of Americans were very confident (31%) or somewhat confident (46%) that the U.S. government would be able to handle a virus outbreak. That tracks closely with a poll conducted Feb. 13-16 by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, which also found about 3 in 4 Americans were at least moderately confident that U.S. health officials could handle the job. Gallup also reported Americans were more confident than they were in previous administrations’ ability to deal with Zika, Ebola, swine flu and bird flu, based on an average of polls during those times. But the coronavirus polls were conducted when deaths from COVID-19 were still happening abroad, rather than on U.S. soil. Since then, Trump appointed Vice President Mike Pence on Feb. 26 to lead the coronavirus response as the U.S. stock market slid over epidemic fears and the first U.S. cases emerged of community transmission that didn’t involve overseas travel.  To date, there are now at least 21 U.S. deaths — with all but three victims in Washington state — and more than 500 infections scattered over more than 30 states as the federal government struggles to meet demand for diagnostic testing kits and Trump at times offers contrary messaging to his federal health experts. Trump claims higher poll ratings than previous administrations got when handling virus outbreaks. But early in the swine flu outbreak in May 2009, when Barack Obama was president, 3 in 4 Americans had confidence in the government’s management of the crisis, according to Gallup. That was about the same level of approval expressed for the government’s handling of the coronavirus in early February. Confidence in the 2009 response declined as the consequences worsened. As such, Trump’s verdict of having the “highest” ratings ever is premature and misleading. ___ AP Director of Public Opinion Research Emily Swanson contributed to this report. ___  EDITOR’S NOTE — A look at the veracity of claims by political figures. ___  Find AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd  Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck",AP FACT CHECK: Trump's misguided boast on virus poll ratings,2020-03-08T18:36:29Z,https://apnews.com/7c07f069fdbcfd256703ce7bdf6363fb,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on the 2020 presidential campaign (all times local): 2:20 p.m. Bernie Sanders says his campaign is gauging when it may become necessary to cancel the large campaign rallies that public health experts say could be breeding grounds to spread the potentially deadly respiratory illness. The Democratic presidential candidate says that public health “obviously” comes first so he remains in constant contact with public health officials about holding events. Federal health authorities have been advising older people and those with medical conditions in particular to avoid crowded spaces. But that so far hasn’t led President Donald Trump or his two remaining major Democratic presidential rivals to cut back on big campaign events. Trump is 73 years old, while Sanders is 78 and Joe Biden is 77. Sanders says “in the best of all possible worlds” the three presidential candidates should probably limit their travel and avoid crowds, “but right now, we’re running as hard as we can.” ___ 2:10 p.m. Bernie Sanders says that without the racial barriers that Jesse Jackson tore down as a presidential candidate in 1984 and 1988, Barack Obama never would have been president. The civil rights leader endorsed Sanders on Sunday and appeared with the Vermont senator at a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Sanders introduced Jackson at the event and said Jackson “has broken down more barriers than others can even dream of” and that Jackson blazed a political trail that helped lead Obama to the White House. Sanders said: “If there was no Jesse Jackson, in my view, there never would have been a President Barack Obama.”  Jackson told the crowd that he was standing with Sanders on Sunday “because he stood with me.” Jackson shrugged off some voters’ uneasiness about Sanders’ avowed democratic socialist ideology. Jackson says democracy is the key part of Sanders’ views. Sander is Jackson will give him a boost before the state’s 2020 primary on Tuesday. ___ 12:20 p.m. Joe Biden has worshipped at a predominantly African American church in Mississippi, two days before the state’s presidential primary where black voters will play an important role. While the former vice president was in Jackson, rival Bernie Sanders has scheduled events Sunday in Michigan, another of the six states that will vote on Tuesday. Biden was welcomed by applause at New Hope Baptist Church. He was accompanied by the NAACP national president, Derrick Johnson, and a leading member of Congress, Bennie Thompson — both of whom are from Mississippi.  They sat in the front row, and Biden sang along with the congregation: “Oh, victory in Jesus, my savior forever.”  ___ 12 p.m. A progressive group with close ties to Elizabeth Warren is urging its members to support Bernie Sanders in Michigan’s Democratic presidential primary on Tuesday. But the group is stopping short of endorsing the Vermont senator. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee has sent a message out to its nearly 16,000 members in Michigan. The group would like to see the primary campaign go on as long as possible to ensure that Sanders and Joe Biden, the two leading candidates, are sufficiently tested to face President Donald Trump in November.  The committee says that means voting “strategically” for Sanders. It says it’s “heartbroken” that Warren is out of the race. The group says if the goal is to beat Trump, then “you want to be super sure Bernie or Biden are tested and can go the distance” and that “a vote for Bernie is a vote to let the contest continue instead of prematurely coronating Biden.” Warren suspended her presidential campaign on Thursday. The Massachusetts senator says she’s still deciding between endorsing Biden and Sanders. Politically, she’s much more aligned with Sanders. But Warren criticized both Sanders and Biden in the final weeks of her campaign, meaning her choice may not be as obvious as it once seemed.",The Latest: Sanders assessing big events in wake of outbreak,2020-03-08T16:08:11Z,https://apnews.com/a7f6a58d8e0509a28947bf247c0cfd5c,AP
"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Irish eyes at the U.S. Capitol will not smile on President Donald Trump on St. Patrick’s Day.  Trump is skipping an annual bipartisan luncheon with House and Senate lawmakers celebrating the ties that bind the U.S. and Ireland, a White House spokesman said.  Trump blamed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. “Since the speaker has chosen to tear this nation apart with her actions and her rhetoric, the president will not participate in moments where she so often chooses to drive discord and disunity,” spokesman Judd Deere said in an emailed statement. The House speaker traditionally hosts the luncheon. Trump instead will celebrate with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar at the White House  on Thursday — five days before St. Patrick’s Day.  Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Pelosi, said congressional support for the U.S.-Ireland relationship has never been stronger. “One would think that the White House could set petty, partisan politics aside for this historic occasion,” Hammill said in an email.  Trump attended the luncheon in 2017 and 2018 when Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., was speaker, and in 2019, after Pelosi, D-Calif, won back the gavel. Trump remains incensed at Pelosi for leading the Democratic-controlled House in December to impeach him after he asked Ukraine’s leader to investigate Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden while delaying delivery of military aid Congress had approved to help the country defend against Russian aggression. The Senate’s Republican majority voted in February to acquit Trump. Speaker Thomas P. “Tip” O’Neill, D-Mass., hosted the first St. Patrick’s Day lunch in 1983. President Ronald Reagan and other House and Senate lawmakers attended the gathering, which had been arranged to ease tension between the two Irish-American leaders, according to the House. The lunch became an annual event on Capitol Hill in 1987, missed by presidents just four times since then. Bill Clinton sent regrets after having knee surgery two days before St. Patrick’s Day in 1997. George W. Bush passed on the 2003 lunch, held days before the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Last year, Pelosi said the lunch is “a tradition where we dispense with our differences, whether they’re political or whether they’re competitive in any other way.” Politico first reported Trump’s decision. ___ Follow Darlene Superville on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap","Trump to skip St. Patrick's Day Hill luncheon, blames Pelosi",2020-03-08T18:08:24Z,https://apnews.com/974688a45453bbc1bcfc1f368ebaed1f,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — A man in his 50s tested positive for coronavirus — the first presumptively confirmed case in the nation’s capital — and another person who traveled through the city has also tested positive in Maryland, officials said. District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser said Saturday the man in the initial case started exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 in late February. He was admitted to a Washington hospital on Thursday and appeared to have no history of international travel and no close contacts to any other confirmed cases across the U.S., Bowser said. “With his test yielding presumptive positive, D.C. Health has started its investigation in keeping with CDC guidelines,” Bowser said. The investigation includes tracing the man’s movements, though the mayor declined to say where in Washington the man lived.  Virginia recorded its first case Saturday when a U.S. Marine stationed at Fort Belvoir was found to have the virus. President Donald Trump said he wasn’t concerned “at all” about the coronavirus getting closer to the White House after the first Washington case was confirmed and officials said an attendee of a recent political conference in the capital where Trump himself had spoken also tested positive for the virus. “No, I’m not concerned at all. No, I’m not. We’ve done a great job,” Trump said.  Though the man in the initial Washington case had no travel history and no contact with anyone confirmed to have coronavirus, the man was tested for COVID-19 because he was considered to be at risk for complications, said Dr. Anjali Talwalkar, the principal senior deputy director for the district’s health department.  The second man, who passed through Washington, is also in his 50s and lives in Nigeria, but had been staying with family members in Washington recently, officials said. He tested positive in Maryland, where he remains hospitalized, Bowser said. On Sunday, health officials said they had determined as part of their investigation that “an individual’s visitation to Christ Church Georgetown warrants precautionary measures.” In a statement, they recommended the church temporarily halt services and district health officials were reaching out to congregants and visitors. The church’s rector did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.  “We are currently conducting an intensive investigation to identify any exposures to COVID-19 that may have occurred at the church,” the statement said.  Officials had no plans to cancel any events, including the annual Cherry Blossom Festival, which starts on March 20 and draws thousands of tourists. “We recognize that it is fluid and every day we will monitor the situation on the ground in the district,” Bowser said.  Officials also stressed they were prepared for the spread of the virus and have been coordinating preparedness with a variety of agencies.  Dr. Jennifer Smith, who leads Washington’s public health laboratory, said officials have the capability of testing about 50 patients per day. The district has also ordered more than 42,000 masks to be delivered to the district’s fire and emergency medical workers, officials said.  Officials said they were in contact with their counterparts at health departments across the U.S., including in New York and California, after two people who attended the American Israel Public Affairs Committee event in Washington were diagnosed with coronavirus. Meanwhile, Maryland officials warned Saturday that a person who attended the recent Conservative Political Action Conference in the suburb of Oxon Hill had tested positive for the virus. Both Trump and Vice President Mike Pence spoke at the conference. The White House said Saturday there was no indication that either had met or were in “close proximity” to the infected attendee. When asked whether his campaign rallies would would continue in light of the CPAC case, the president replied, “We’ll have tremendous rallies.” Trump held his most recent campaign rally last Monday in Charlotte, North Carolina. He waved off other questions to join a dinner for the president of Brazil, who was visiting Trump at the president’s home in south Florida. The Marine at Fort Belvoir was the first military case of coronavirus reported inside the U.S., said a Pentagon official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the case. The Marine was being treated at Fort Belvoir Community Hospital, located south of Washington, and had recently returned from an overseas assignment, Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said on Twitter. ___ Superville reported from Palm Beach, Florida.

They question whether to have kids in an environment where the effects of climate change are getting worse by the day. The young Bernie Sanders supporters who gathered for a Super Tuesday watch party in Michigan came with reasons both personal and ideological for wanting him to be president. But they were all asking the same question: Why can’t things be different?  “Young people are aspirational,” said Jaclyn Schess, 24, a health economics researcher at the University of Michigan. She sat on a folding chair inside the Sanders campaign’s Ann Arbor office watching returns projected on a screen from the online news network The Young Turks. “We can look at what’s happening now without being weighed down by the failures of the past and say ‘Our country deserves better. ... We can do it.’”  As Sanders tries to top former Vice President Joe Biden for the Democratic presidential nomination, the Vermont senator and self-described democratic socialist’s most enduring support has come from voters under age 30 like Schess. They are moved by Sanders’ vision for the country — of a place where everyone has health care, college is free and rich people and corporations don’t have more political influence than teachers and students — and his consistency on the issues. They don’t believe his ideas are unrealistic or unaffordable. To them, the main argument that President Donald Trump and others have used against Sanders — that he’s a “socialist” who wants to give everything away for free — isn’t at all scary and may be a point in Sanders’ favor. Those young voters remain the backbone of Sanders’ effort, though they weren’t enough for him to stop Biden from leapfrogging him in the delegate count on Super Tuesday. Sanders won four states out of 14, including California, with support from 57% of voters under 30, according to AP VoteCast surveys of voters across eight of the states that voted.  But those young voters made up just 15% of the vote, putting pressure on Sanders to increase that vote share or broaden his appeal — or both — as the race moves on to Michigan, Washington, Missouri, Mississippi on Tuesday and elsewhere after that. The biggest delegate haul this week will be Michigan. Sanders defeated Hillary Clinton there in 2016, thanks in part to strong support in counties that are home to colleges such as the University of Michigan and Michigan State University. A big part of Sanders’ success is that he’s empowered younger voters and made them feel they are part of a movement in a way few politicians have done since Barack Obama in 2008, said John Della Volpe,director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics.  Their potential political power is notable. Generation Z — those between 18 and 23 — make up 1 in 10 eligible voters,and is the only generation that has grown by percentage of eligible voting population since 2016, according to the Pew Research Center.  AP VoteCast shows these young voters more likely than those older to be liberal ideologically. Sixty percent of voters under 30 across eight Super Tuesday states surveyed described themselves as liberal and 39% said they are “very liberal.” But they have historically turned out to vote at much lower rates than older voters, a trend that has continued this primary season.  “If they all voted at close to the proportion of older voters it’s a completely different country,” Della Volpe said.  Sanders said at a post-Super Tuesday news conference that his campaign hasn’t been as successful as he’d hoped at getting young people out to vote. In a sign he’s ramping up those efforts in Michigan, he canceled events in Mississippi to spend more time in Michigan, including a Sunday night rally in Ann Arbor, hosted by the university’s chapter of Students for Bernie. Sanders drew almost 6,000 people to a rally on the campus in 2016, days before his surprise win in the state over Clinton. “The vision he’s talking about is of the world that we want,” said Emily Moos, 22, who works as an environmental organizer registering young people to vote in Ann Arbor.  Moos was among those at the Super Tuesday gathering who believe the influence of money, particularly from fossil fuel companies and other corporations, has corrupted U.S. politics, affecting everything from the climate crisis to health care and the minimum wage.  Sanders has raised over $120 million this election cycle, including more than $25 million in January, from over 1.5 million people while refusing money from corporations and political action committees. That’s a big reason Sanders’ supporters are choosing him over rivals such as Biden, who they say is influenced by PACs and large-dollar donors.  “How can we trust anybody if they have to kind of kneel to these corporate entities?” said Matthew Rodriguez, 29, who is studying in the University of Michigan’s school of social work. “We can trust Bernie. When he says he’ll fight for these things, we know he’ll fight for it no matter what.”  That extends to health care and Sanders’ push for “Medicare for All,” which his rivals have described as a pipe dream.  Jonah Hahn, 25, said he saw firsthand how it could work when he was living in Spain for a fellowship. That country’s national health care system provides universal coverage and access to free health care for Spanish nationals. In the private insurance market, Hahn paid $60 per month for everything, with no copays. Back in the U.S. he pays a $50 copay to see a specialist, after a $300 monthly premium.  “Nothing convinces you about the importance of universal health care like living in a country that has it,” said Hahn, who considers himself a democratic socialist. “It’s not like I needed to be radicalized, but when you actually see it, you say ‘OK, Spain has certain political issues, but no one is debating whether their health care system works or not.’”  What if Sanders isn’t the nominee? University of Michigan student Keegan Cupp, 18, said he’s “Bernie or bust,” and will stay home. But he was the only one of about a dozen people interviewed who said so.  “I dislike Trump to the highest degree and I will hold my nose and vote for Biden if I have to,” Rodriguez said.  Emily Arking, 18, said if Sanders isn’t the nominee it “will be a big bummer” because it will be her first election voting. But it won’t stop her.  “I was talking to my dad earlier and he told me that there were plenty of times he’s walked into the voting booth and just let out a huge sigh because he didn’t like who he was voting for,” she said. “But he did it nonetheless.”  Schess said she was disappointed to hear there was anyone in the room who planned to stay home.  “You’re contributing to Trump winning if you don’t vote,” she said. “There’s too much at stake.”  ___ Associated Press writer Hannah Fingerhut in Washington contributed to this report.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — The photo of his father was barely recognizable. The old man looked unusually pale and tired, and his customary beard was shaved off. The son who received the photo over WhatsApp was immediately suspicious.  He hadn’t heard from his family in western China for two years while he studied at a U.S. university.  His family are Uighurs, a predominantly Muslim ethnic group that has become the target of a massive crackdown in China. Since 2017, more than 1 million people have been confined to internment camps and many more are monitored in their own homes.  Why would he get this message now? And why would it come over WhatsApp? The messaging platform is censored for ordinary people in China, but often is used by authorities.  No words accompanied the photo, but he interpreted it as a kind of warning.  “I feel like I’m being watched even in the United States,” he said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he fears reprisals from the Chinese government. “They have all of our information. They know where we live.”  Such fear of surveillance has become a fact of life for thousands of Uighurs living outside China and struggling to rebuild lives abroad, while family and friends go missing in China’s western Xinjiang region. Within China, the State Department says, many Uighurs have been subjected to torture and other abuse.  Even Uighurs who now live in the relative safety of the United States, where their situation has sparked bipartisan concern in Congress, say they still fear being monitored and worry that speaking freely may spur reprisals against family members in Xinjiang.  “I hear these stories all the time,” said Kuzzat Altay, president of the Uighur American Association whose own father renounced him in a video released by Chinese authorities on social media. “People come to me crying.” Altay, who came to the U.S. as a refugee and has become a citizen, started a Uighur entrepreneurship network outside Washington. But most of the 25 members dropped out at the urging of family members in Xinjiang who had been visited by local authorities. Altay said he thinks Chinese authorities worried that his entrepreneurship group would have discussed the crackdown back home.  The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. Ferkat Jawdat is a naturalized American citizen who came to the U.S. nine years ago and works as a software engineer in Virginia. His mother was taken into the Xinjiang internment camps in 2018. Last May, when she was briefly released, she called and told him not to speak out about Uighur issues. He later learned from relatives that she had contacted him at police insistence and was taken back into police custody the very next day.  The Chinese government is broadly suspicious of Uighurs who have spent significant time abroad, said Brian Mezger, an immigration lawyer who specializes in Uighur asylum cases. “The Chinese government views exposure to foreign influence as basically polluting the Uighurs,” said Mezger, whose practice is based in Rockville, Maryland.  A dozen Uighurs in the U.S. interviewed by The Associated Press, most of whom did not want their names used, described various forms of intimidation.  They described calls from Chinese government officials instructing them to “check in” at Chinese consulates. Some were told their Chinese passports would not be renewed and were offered one-way travel documents back to China. Several said relatives back home were visited by local police looking for information about family members abroad. The young man who received the photo of his father in June, two years after family members in Xinjiang warned him to cut off contact, says he doesn’t know what authorities wanted from him.  He also received a series of unsettling text messages in the Uighur language, but he responded in Chinese to ask why the sender had contacted him. The person sending the messages said that if he wanted to have a video chat with my father, he could arrange it. “He wouldn’t say what he wanted from me.”  These accounts of harassment match reports compiled by activists and human rights groups, including Amnesty International, which last month documented widespread fear of surveillance and retribution among 400 Uighurs living in 22 countries.  The Uighur global diaspora is estimated to be between 1 million and 1.6 million people.  There are several thousand Uighurs in the United States, with the largest concentration living in the Washington D.C. area. “This is happening to people’s neighbors, to fellow Americans — that’s what’s so scary,” said Francisco Bencosme, an Asia-Pacific advocacy manager for Amnesty International.  Uighurs qualify for asylum in the U.S. because today they face almost certain detention if they return to China, said Mezger, who has represented hundreds of people from Xinjiang. He said nearly all of his cases have been successful. The wait for asylum, however, can take years and the anxiety can be grueling.  “Even if you’re free in the U.S., you can’t leave the U.S. while your asylum application is pending,” said James Millward, a professor of history who researches Xinjiang at Georgetown University. “If you have relatives in Europe or Canada, you can’t go see them. You can’t travel there for work. And you may have to wait for years.”  Xinjiang, which means “new frontier” in Chinese, was brought under control of Chinese authorities in Beijing in the 19th century. But the western desert region has longstanding cultural, religious, and linguistic ties to Central Asia and to Turkey. Uighurs have faced numerous previous persecution and assimilation campaigns by the Chinese government.  An enhanced security state  began to take shape in Xinjiang after 2009, when race riots left around 200 people dead in the capital city of Urumqi. In recent years, surveillance cameras and police checkpoints have become ubiquitous.  The government began to build internment camps in 2017 as a means of intimidation and social control. Former camp detainees have previously told the AP that after being confined in the camps, they were forced to renounce their faith and swear fealty to China’s ruling Communist Party. Uighurs face limits on the use of their language in schools, their ability to check into hotels and restrictions on cultural practices such as wearing beards and fasting during religious holidays.  The government’s goal is to “eradicate Uighur culture,” said Dolkun Isa, president of the World Uighur Congress.  He added that social controls have grown more stringent since the inception of Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative — an overseas infrastructure funding policy — has enhanced the strategic importance of Xinjiang’s location bordering Central Asia. China’s foreign ministry regularly bristles at international criticism of policies in Xinjiang, which it views as an internal matter. It has said that measures in Xinjiang are intended to curb religious extremism and that the detention camps are “vocational centers,” where people are held voluntarily. But it has refused to permit independent monitors to visit. It’s not possible to confirm that the intimidating messages received by Uighurs abroad come from Chinese officials. But the Uighurs’ accounts of harassment have been consistent enough that both Republicans and Democrats in Congress back legislation that would require the FBI to help protect Uighurs in the United States.  The young man who received the photo of his father and the string of suspicious messages said he called the FBI and that two agents met with him. The agency wouldn’t comment on whether it investigated the particular case, but said in a statement, “Without discussing specifics, we take all reports of threats or intimidation seriously.” Meanwhile, the man has continued his studies while he awaits a decision on his asylum application and worries about relatives in China. “They could punish my family, if they haven’t already sent them to the camps, because I didn’t cooperate.” “Even if you have physical freedom, it’s very difficult to escape the reach of the Chinese government,” said Mezger, the attorney.

"PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump would not commit Saturday to continue holding off on hitting Brazil with tariffs on imports of its aluminum and steel, saying “I don’t make any promises.” Trump commented in the presence of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who Trump was hosting for dinner at his resort home in southern Florida.  In a tweet in December, Trump accused Bolsonaro’s government of hurting American farmers by manipulating its currency. He pledged to slap tariffs on Brazilian aluminum and steel, but withdrew the threat days later.  “We have a very good relationship as to tariffs ... we want to always help Brazil,” said Trump, who appeared with Bolsonaro at the front door of his Mar-a-Lago estate. U.S. and Brazilian flags fluttered in the breeze on either side of the doorway. “The friendship is probably stronger now than it’s never been,” Trump said.  Asked whether his comments meant no new tariffs on Brazil, Trump declined to commit.  “I don’t make any promises,” he said, before he led Bolsonaro to a dinner table on the club’s bustling outdoor patio. U.S. National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien, and Trump’s daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, both senior White House advisers, were also at the table along with several Brazilian government officials.  Trump also praised Bolsonaro’s leadership.  “He’s doing a fantastic job. Great job. Brazil loves him and the USA loves him,” Trump said.  Brazil is coping with a double-digit unemployment rate and economic growth that is half of what Bolsonaro promised as a candidate. He is also struggling to get legislation through congress. White House officials said the crisis in Venezuela, a possible U.S.-Brazil trade deal and Chinese telecom company Huawei were discussion topics for the leaders. A statement the White House released after the meeting did not mention Huawei. Bolsonaro is on a three-day trip to the United States that includes a visit to the Miami headquarters of U.S. Southern Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in Central and South America, and the Caribbean. Bolsonaro also scheduled meetings with Florida Sens. Marco Rubio and Rick Scott, both Republicans. Trump is in Florida through Monday. Trump’s administration has been the most important ally for Venezuela’s opposition since Juan Guaidó leaped to the center of Venezuela’s tumultuous political landscape more than a year ago. He pledged to force President Nicolás Maduro from power and restore democracy.  Though Guaidó has the backing of more than 60 nations, his popularity has faded, coupled with a failed military uprising. The United States is continuing its “maximum pressure” campaign against Maduro and will continue to work on unspecified “bottlenecks” to a trade agreement with Brazil, said a senior Trump administration official who briefed reporters before the leaders met. The U.S. has been pressuring governments worldwide to ban the Chinese tech giant Huawei from having any stake in their 5G networks. But Trump’s campaign was dealt a blow when U.S. ally Britain decided to grant Huawei a limited role in supplying new high-speed network equipment to wireless carriers. The U.S. sees Huawei as an intelligence threat.  Bolsonaro, called the “the Trump of the tropics,” has turned his relationship with the U.S. president into a cornerstone of his foreign diplomacy. The far-right Brazilian leader has used Trump to shore up his base, often praising him and posting videos of himself on social media simply watching Trump speeches on television. Trump likes Bolsonaro and says they have a good relationship. He hosted Bolsonaro at the White House last March.  The U.S. trip comes as a welcome respite for Bolsonaro, who at home is dealing with a weak economy and a strained relationship with congress. Several opposition parties published a manifesto this week, encouraging Brazilians to demonstrate against the government. Bolsonaro’s allies see the invitation to dinner at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s private, dues-paying club in Palm Beach, as another sign that Bolsonaro’s alignment with America is paying off. Trump last year granted Brazil the status of privileged ally outside NATO and backed its bid for membership in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. But U.S. support can be fickle and government critics question whether Brazil’s seemingly unconditional embrace of Trump’s brand of politics will yield any real benefits. Trump’s refusal to commit to holding off on tariffs most likely would be viewed as an example. Brazil also is struggling to combat growing illegal deforestation in the vast Amazon rainforest and was criticized for its poor handling of devastating fires in the region last summer.  ___ Jeantet reported from Rio de Janeiro.

"DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) — The Democratic presidential primary is down to two major candidates, and it shows.  Former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders are spending their first weekend as their party’s last top White House contenders increasingly taking aim at one another. Each wants to show he’s the best choice before six more states — Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington — vote on Tuesday.  It reflects the new contours of a race that once featured 20-plus Democrats. An increasingly bitter matchup could endure for months as Biden and Sanders compete for the right to face President Donald Trump in November.  “We have a two-person race,” Sanders said Saturday in Dearborn, a Detroit suburb with one of the nation’s largest Arab American populations. “And all over this country, people are asking themselves which candidate can best defeat Trump. I have zero doubt in my mind that, together, we are the campaign that can beat Trump.” Campaigning in St. Louis, Biden took a number of veiled swipes at Sanders, even as he called on Democrats to rise above Trump’s division. He told the crowd that if they wanted to nominate a “lifelong” and “proud” Democrat, they should pick him. Sanders has run for office as in Independent and identifies himself as a democratic socialist. “If you want a nominee who’ll bring the party together, who will run on a positive progressive vision for the future, not turn this primary into a campaign of negative attacks — because that will only reelect Donald Trump if we go that route — if you want that, join us,‘’ Biden said. Winning, he added, “means uniting America, not sowing more division and anger.“ The former vice president also knocked Sanders’ weeks of suggestions that he is the candidate who can prompt record voter turnout in November and defeat Trump, saying that actually “we’re the campaign that’s going to do that.” Sanders argues that no Democrat will win the presidency “with the same-old, same-old politics of yesteryear.” And in a sign of how biting the contest may become, Sanders supporters — including his campaign manager — raised questions about Biden’s stamina after he gave a seven minute speech in St. Louis. At his second stop, in Kansas City, he again gave a truncated version of his stump speech, speaking for a little over 15 minutes. Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir issued a tweet noting Biden’s short speaking time and highlighting the fact that Sanders had three campaign events on his schedule, “each speaking engagement extending for close to an hour.” That prompted swift online push-back from Biden allies. Democratic strategist Guy Cecil, who leads the party’s largest outside spending group, tweeted, “Spreading conspiracy theories online won’t help your candidate” but “it will help Donald Trump win in November.”  But the focus on Biden’s age is somewhat ironic given that the 78-year-old Sanders is actually a year older than Biden. Sanders, who has served in Congress since 1991, says he’s bucked the establishment of both parties with decades with unpopular stands that now give him the credibility to lead a political revolution “from the bottom up.” Sanders is pledging to increase Democratic turnout by drawing younger voters, minorities and working class people to the polls even though they tend to vote in lower concentrations than many other Americans. Strong support among Hispanics lifted Sanders to victories in Nevada and California, but Biden trounced him in South Carolina and throughout much of the Deep South that voted during last week’s Super Tuesday. Biden especially ran up the score with African Americans.  Some activists are disappointed that a once diverse field of women and minorities has dwindled to two white men in their late 70s. But in Dearborn, Sanders, who is Jewish, said he was inspired by so many Arab Americans backing him. “I see people coming together from so many different backgrounds. It is beautiful,” he said. He also joked about his age, saying, “Sometimes people say, ‘Bernie, you’re 33 years of age. How do you keep going?’” Top advisers expect Sanders to finish strong in Washington. Still, he canceled a trip to Mississippi to focus on Michigan, Tuesday’s largest prize. He made a stop in Chicago’s Grant Park on Saturday afternoon, and declared that he has a different vision than Biden, “And the American people are going to hear about it.” Sanders will spend the rest of the weekend in Michigan, while Biden is in Missouri and Mississippi.  Sanders said repeatedly that he and Biden are friends and that, if he’s not the nominee, he will support Biden against Trump. But, he added, “In the remaining months, I intend to make it clear what my views are and what Joe Biden’s are.”  The campaign is being conducted as the country is contending with the coronavirus outbreak. The AFL-CIO said Saturday that it was canceling a scheduled presidential forum set for Thursday in Orlando in the week before the Florida primary. Sanders has used many of his Michigan events to hammer Biden’s past support for the North American Free Trade Agreement, arguing that it moved high-paying U.S. jobs to Mexico and China while devastating manufacturing in a state dominated by the auto industry. He’s focused on Biden’s years in the Senate, when Biden backed not only trade agreements and the U.S.-led war in Iraq, but also a ban on using federal funds to pay for abortions. Biden announced this summer that he was reversing his position on that, but Sanders said that wasn’t enough.  “I think we need a candidate that can be trusted on this issue. I am proud to tell you that I am 100% pro choice,” Sanders says.  The pair are also circling each other on the airwaves.  Biden saw a surge of donor support after South Carolina and Super Tuesday, and his campaign announced that it was spending $12 million on a six-state ad buy in places voting Tuesday and the following week. It was his largest single advertising effort of the 2020 campaign. He is using two television and digital ads, one promoting his relationship with President Barack Obama, the other a new effort to counter a Sanders attack on Biden’s past record on Social Security. It’s a criticism Sanders has used for months. And though he hasn’t mentioned it as frequently while campaigning in Michigan, he has released his own ad airing in states voting Tuesday and the following week dinging Biden on Social Security.  It features a past clip of the former vice president saying, “When I argued if we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security.” Biden’s counter spot has a narrator saying, “Biden will increase Social Security benefits and protect it for generations to come.” ___ Jaffe reported from Kansas City, Mo.

"BURNSVILLE, Minn. (AP) — Nearly two years after suburbanites helped drive a Democratic surge, there are clear signs these voters are engaged and primed to vote Democratic again.  Turnout in the Democratic presidential primary has been strong across suburban counties, from northern Virginia to Southern California, that fueled the 2018 wave. In several key counties, turnout has exceeded that of four years ago. In some cases, it has bested the party’s recent high water marks reached during the 2008 primary battle between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.  That has been particularly good news now for Joe Biden. The former vice president, who’s running as a moderate, consensus candidate, soared to the top of the Democratic field this past week, showing strength in places such as Fairfax County in Virginia, and Mecklenburg County in North Carolina. Many suburban Democrats said they are motivated by their desire to oust Trump and a fear that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Biden’s chief primary rival, is a riskier bet.  “My main goal is to not have Trump get reelected,” Gail Hayes, a 67-year-old retired child care provider, said outside a coffee shop in Burnsville, Minnesota, a Twin Cities suburb. Hayes noted that she’s ideologically more aligned with progressives such as Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator who dropped out of the race Thursday. But Hayes described herself as pragmatic and said she voted for Biden because she thinks he can win.  “I wanted to pick someone more moderate,” she said. “I really didn’t decide until a couple hours before I voted.” The Democratic turnout overall has risen, with Iowa, North Carolina and Texas topping 2016 levels, but not the 2008 spike. Virginia was an exception, jumping from 986,000 votes in 2008 to 1.3 million.  Much of that increase is coming in American suburbs that will be pivotal to the November general election. Consider Burnsville, part of once-reliably Republican Dakota County. The sprawling community has grown more racially diverse and more Democratic in recent years. The strip mall where Hayes grabbed a coffee also housed a halal grocer linked with an African restaurant and a Latin grocer linked with a taco shop. A surge of anti-Trump sentiment in the area helped Democrats flip a Republican-held House seat in 2018. Now Dakota County is among the places Trump’s campaign must pick up ground if it wants to make good on its promise to win Minnesota in November.  “The suburbs have been a killing zone for Republicans in the Trump era,” said GOP strategist Alex Conant, a top adviser on Florida Sen. Marco Rubio’s failed 2016 presidential campaign. Conant said Republicans must do better to attract young families and professionals or Democratic gains in suburbs will almost certainly continue.  The opening contests of the Democratic presidential primary, including 14 held Tuesday, brought few signs that the Trump backlash in the suburbs has ebbed. In a dozen counties with swing suburban communities, Democrats cast more ballots than they did four years ago, an analysis found. In nine of the 12 counties, the vote totals eclipsed 2008. The numbers are a sign of both the energy and the population growth driving Democrats’ suburban strength. Both were evident last Tuesday in Virginia, where Democrats have won three straight election cycles since Trump was elected, powered largely by voters in suburban areas. That success includes every statewide race and flipping partisan control of the Legislature and congressional delegation. In Chesterfield County, just south of Richmond, young families have flocked to new subdivisions, shifting the area’s politics at a stunning pace. The county voted for Trump in 2016 but has since helped elect Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam in 2017, sent Democrat Abigail Spanberger to Congress in 2018, and seated a new Democratic state senator in 2019. This past Tuesday, 25,000 more Democrats voted compared with the Democratic primary in 2016.  Voting was up for Democrats in Texas’ Dallas County, another area that flipped a House seat to Democrats in 2018, though turnout was not as high as when Obama was on the ballot. In Virginia, about two-thirds of suburban voters describe themselves as moderate or conservative, rather than liberal, as do about 60% of suburban voters in California, Colorado, Minnesota, North Carolina and Texas, according to AP VoteCast surveys of voters in eight states that held primaries last Tuesday.  That moderate tilt proved to be an advantage for Biden over Sanders, whom many suburban voters said they viewed as less likely to beat Trump. Biden soundly beat Sanders in Dakota County, Chesterfield County and Fairfax. In California, a state Sanders won, he beat Biden in suburban havens of Orange and Riverside counties, although by relatively narrow margins.  Michael McDade, 62, a Democrat who cast his ballot in Cary, North Carolina, home of the Research Triangle Park area, said he voted for Biden as a matter of pragmatism rather than preference.  “I just felt like he had the best chance of consolidating Democrats behind him and the best chance of beating Trump,” he said. The 40-year resident has watched Wake County swell with out-of-state newcomers filling jobs in the booming pharmaceutical and technology industries and surrounding universities, and making the area “much more cosmopolitan.”  Progressives argue that the party’s focus on the suburbs and its cluster of moderate and older voters risks leaving behind the young voters, Latinos and liberals at the core of Sanders’ coalition.  “A campaign that is not inspiring to a rising American electorate, especially of young voters, can be a real challenge for Democrats,” said Neil Sroka at the pro-Sanders Democracy for America. Democrats’ focus shouldn’t be on the so-called swing voter who shifts between Republicans and Democrats, “but those who swing in and out of the electorate,” he said. Indeed, Sanders’ supporters stand out for their skepticism of most other candidates in the race. At least half of his voters across eight states surveyed said they would be unhappy with Biden, according to VoteCast. At the Burnsville coffee shop, Sanders supporter Ali Sugule, 39, wasn’t enthusiastic about Biden. Nevertheless, the Somali American who considers himself a progressive said he “will back up anybody” the Democrats ultimately nominate. Sherman Bausch, 44, a business technology consultant from Lakeville in Dakota County called Trump a “horrible role model” but said he also would be “very, very frustrated” to have to vote for Sanders.  “I don’t think replacing one guy at one end who’s yelling at everybody with a guy on the other end who’s yelling at everybody is an appropriate move for the country at this point,” he said. He voted for Biden.  Outside of Denver, Andrea Staron, 38, said she used to vote Republican. But she left her presidential choice blank in 2016.  On Super Tuesday, the law student who is anti-abortion and deeply interested in anti-poverty work voted on Super Tuesday because she wanted to play a role in choosing an opponent to a president she detests. Sanders has some “very interesting ideas,” she said, but “I want somebody who can beat Trump.” She waited until the last minute. And she voted for Biden.  __ Mascaro reported from Washington.

"PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump says he isn’t concerned “at all” about the coronavirus getting closer to the White House after the nation’s capital reported its first case Saturday.  Maryland officials warned Saturday that a person who attended the recent Conservative Political Action Conference in the suburb of Oxon Hill had tested positive for the virus. Both Trump and Vice President Mike Pence spoke at the conference. The White House said Saturday there was no indication that either had met or were in “close proximity” to the infected attendee. Asked if he was concerned about the virus getting closer, Trump said: “No, I’m not concerned at all. No, I’m not. We’ve done a great job.” When asked whether his thousand person campaign rallies would would continue in light of the CPAC case, the president replied, “We’ll have tremendous rallies.” Trump held his most recent campaign rally last Monday in Charlotte, North Carolina. He waved off other questions to join a dinner for the president of Brazil, who was visiting Trump at the president’s home in south Florida.

"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — At a funeral service last month, Jannie Jones locked eyes with Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn across the church sanctuary and crooked a finger, beckoning him to come over to the pew where she sat. She had a question, but she didn’t want to ask it out loud. The House majority whip bent down so the 76-year-old Jones could whisper in his ear: “I need to know who you’re going to vote for,” she asked. Clyburn whispered back, “Joe Biden.” Giving Clyburn a thumbs up, Jones wondered if he’d endorse the former vice president publicly. “I had no idea he was going to do it,” Jones recalled in a telephone interview with The Associated Press from her home in Hopkins, South Carolina, outside the capital city of Columbia. Not only did Clyburn go public with his choice among the sprawling Democratic field, just days ahead of his native South Carolina’s pivotal primary, but he also anonymously credited Jones and their whispered conversation with his choice to do so. “She said, ‘You don’t have to say it out loud, but just whisper into my ear, who are you going to vote for next Saturday? I have been waiting to hear from you. I need to hear from you,’” Clyburn recalled in his passionate endorsement speech, three days before South Carolina’s Feb. 29 vote. “I decided then and there that I would not stay silent.” Biden handily won South Carolina, bested chief rival Bernie Sanders on Super Tuesday and bumped rivals Tom Steyer, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Mike Bloomberg and Elizabeth Warren out of the contest in one of the most muscular comebacks in presidential campaign history. The kingmaker moment was a long time coming for Clyburn, a minister’s son whose congressional career began 27 years ago, after a false start in losing a state legislative race. He rose through the ranks and became the vote-counting House Democratic whip on Nancy Pelosi’s leadership team, the No. 3 Democrat in Congress as well as its highest-ranking black member. And as Republicans rose to prominence in his native South Carolina, Clyburn’s stature in the state increased among its Democratic contingent. Political endorsements at times aren’t thought of as carrying significant heft, used by candidates and endorsers alike for a momentary media bounce that quickly fades to another name on a list. But the backing of Clyburn seems to have been the endorsement that brought Biden’s candidacy back from the brink following lackluster performances in other early states. It was an awaited signal for many black voters in South Carolina that Biden would be the candidate to stand up for their interests. He scored a blowout margin of victory of nearly 30 points. “In our community, as African Americans, we’ve always had a history of hearing from people who have been chosen to lead us,” said Antjuan Seawright. “This example of Jim Clyburn is no different. There’s a reason why I think God preserved him for this moment, to be able to have such an impact.” Biden has acknowledged the lifeline thrown to him by his friend. “My buddy, Jim Clyburn, you brought me back,” he said, adding that the congressman had “lifted me in this campaign on his shoulders.” Biden had long led in surveys heading into South Carolina, where fewer than half of Democratic voters are white. He ultimately won 64% of the ballots cast by African American voters, also performing strongly with older voters, women, regular churchgoers and moderates and conservatives, according to AP VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of more than 1,400 voters in South Carolina’s Democratic primary. AP VoteCast results also showed that about a third of South Carolina Democrats said they made a late decision about their vote. Of those voters, roughly half ultimately supported Biden. As the field constricted and candidates dropped out, Biden’s momentum carried him to victories in 10 of 14 Super Tuesday states. In Alabama, where African American voters made up a majority of the Democratic primary electorate, roughly 7 in 10 supported the former vice president, according to AP VoteCast. Once Clyburn spoke his mind, said another strategist, Democratic voters of all backgrounds who may have been waffling among the remaining moderate choices saw an imperative to unite behind one of them. “They got their theoretical permission from Jim Clyburn to do what they needed to do, because they realized the importance of this election, and that the only way that we were going to beat Bernie Sanders, in order to beat Donald Trump, was if we all worked together,” said Amanda Loveday, who has formerly served as Clyburn’s spokeswoman and executive director of the South Carolina Democratic Party. “If your ultimate goal is to beat Donald Trump, it’s time to elect someone who’s going to do that.” Reflecting recently on that pivotal conversation with Jones, Clyburn said it wasn’t until he had turned to walk away that he realized what she was asking him to do. “The expression on her face, the look in her eyes when she said it, she just bowled me over with it,” he told The AP. “It was just a combination of stuff. I knew that this lady was asking me to man up.” Jones, who had never met Clyburn before their exchange, said she was shocked to see him on cable channels crediting her for inspiring him to go public. But, several weeks after the whispers that helped change the political landscape, she said she was elated to have played a role. “He is a superhero,” Jones said. “I have so much joy in my heart because Congressman Clyburn endorsed Biden.” ___ Kellman reported from Washington. ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.”",Clyburn's kingmaker moment changes landscape of 2020 race,2020-03-07T05:08:55Z,https://apnews.com/74ca4d1c3976887be54477b934abe4ae,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — As the stock market convulses, airline schedules buckle and businesses worry their overseas supply lines will snap, President Donald Trump is looking on the sunny side of an economy clouded by the coronavirus. For several weeks he’s played down the consequences of the public health emergency even as his agencies scramble to manage it. Now he’s suggesting that a robust jobs report might be explained in part by the prospect that Americans are hunkering down and focusing more of their spending in their own country. There’s no evidence that the virus has juiced jobs. Trump’s plentiful and sometimes inaccurate comments on the outbreak this past week prompted the chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., to suggest that Trump and Vice President Mike Pence stand back and “let the experts do the talking.” Trump paid that advice no heed. A sampling of the past week’s rhetoric on the virus and other matters and how it compares with the facts: CORONAVIRUS TRUMP: “We’re going to have Americans staying home instead of going and spending the money in other countries. And maybe that’s one of the reasons the job numbers are so good.” — remarks to the press Friday. THE FACTS: That is not one of the reasons the job numbers are so good.  The government’s report Friday showing employers added a healthy 273,000 jobs last month was compiled before the coronavirus had spread through multiple states.  Even so, the report showed employment at hotels was flat. Restaurant hiring jumped by more than 50,000, but most economists attributed that to relatively warm weather. Now, with many businesses restricting their employees’ travel, airlines are already getting hit: United Airlines said Wednesday it has instituted a hiring freeze. Trump is probably correct that fewer Americans will go abroad and spend money while the outbreak is active. The flip side is that fewer foreigners may come to the U.S. and spend their money here. ___ WHITE HOUSE: “The President is no longer traveling to Atlanta today. The CDC has been proactive and prepared since the very beginning and the President does not want to interfere with the CDC’s mission to protect the health and welfare of their people and the agency.” — statement Friday about Trump’s planned visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. THE FACTS: Actually, the White House rationale for canceling the trip was contradicted a short time later by Trump, who said he postponed because a CDC employee in Atlanta was thought to have contracted the infectious disease and “because of the one person, they didn’t want me going.” It was not about staying out of the way of CDC employees, He said it turned out that the person was not infected. He visited the CDC after all. ___ TRUMP: “A lot of people will have this, and it’s very mild. They will get better very rapidly. They don’t even see a doctor ... So, if we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work — some of them go to work, but they get better.” – Fox News interview Wednesday. TRUMP: “I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work. This is just more Fake News.” — tweet Thursday. THE FACTS: He seems to be suggesting that people with COVID-19 can go to work if they have minor symptoms, contradicting the guidance of his federal health officials. Regardless of how sick people may or may not feel, people are advised to stay home. The CDC states  that people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 who do not need hospitalization should restrict their activities and “stay home except to get medical care.” “Do not go to work, school or public areas,” it states.  ___ TRUMP, on developing tests for coronavirus in patients: “The Obama administration made a decision on testing that turned out to be very detrimental to what we’re doing. And we undid that decision a few days ago so that the testing can take place in a much more accurate and rapid fashion.” — Wednesday at the White House. VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: “The last administration asserted FDA jurisdiction over testing and the development of tests like this. ... The president changed that on Saturday so that now, as I spoke to several governors this morning, the states now have the ability to actually conduct the coronavirus test in state labs, university laboratories.” — Wednesday at the White House. TRUMP: “And now we have tremendous flexibility. Many, many more sites. Many, many more people. And you couldn’t have had that under the Obama rule, and we ended that rule very quickly.” — Wednesday. THE FACTS: They’re trying to blame Barack Obama for something his administration didn’t do. It’s not true that an Obama-era rule limited laboratories run by companies, universities and hospitals from developing and running tests for the coronavirus during an emergency. No such regulation existed. The Trump administration’s action last Saturday only undid a policy that its own Food and Drug Administration put in place. The new action lets labs develop and use coronavirus diagnostic tests before the agency reviews them. Previously, the FDA had only authorized use of a government test developed by the CDC. FDA guidance drafted during the Obama administration called for tighter regulation of so-called laboratory-developed tests, a market traditionally not overseen by the agency. But that guidance was not brought into effect. Even if it had been, it would not have applied to public health emergencies such as the coronavirus. ___ TRUMP: “We’re talking about a vaccine. Maybe a cure is possible. But we’re talking about a vaccine and they’re moving along very quickly, all of the pharmaceutical companies, are moving along very quickly.” — remarks Monday.  TRUMP: The U.S. may have a vaccine “relatively soon” and “something that makes you feel better ... sooner.” — North Carolina rally Monday. THE FACTS: That’s misleading, given the far more cautious pronouncements of federal public health officials and scientists. They say a vaccine is probably more than a year away at best and there are no special treatments for COVID-19. The notion of a quick “cure” is not in their vocabulary as they focus on trying to help people avoid getting the disease in the first place. What’s actually happening: Studies have begun in COVID-19 patients in parts of the world to see if certain antiviral medications could help treat the infection.  Today, there are no proven treatments. In China, scientists have been testing a combination of HIV drugs against the new coronavirus, as well as an experimental drug named remdesivir that was in development to fight Ebola. In the U.S., the University of Nebraska Medical Center also began testing remdesivir in some Americans who were found to have COVID-19 after being evacuated from a cruise ship in Japan. It’s not known how soon such studies will answer whether any of the drugs help. And many patients recover without needing any treatment. The biggest concern is how to help the fraction who become severely ill.  ___ TRUMP: The U.S. is “ranked by far No. 1 in the world for preparedness” — North Carolina rally. THE FACTS: Not “by far.” He’s referring to a report coauthored by Johns Hopkins Centers for Health Security. Hopkins experts on Monday said the U.S. got a “grade” that overall was highest by a few points among a variety of high-income countries that are all at about the same level of preparedness. But the report’s overall finding: “No country is fully prepared for an epidemic or pandemic,” cautioned Hopkins’ Jennifer Nuzzo, who coauthored the report. It’s difficult to say from the report that a country that scores two points higher than another is going to fare much better, she added. In the U.S., the biggest worry is access to that health care. “If fear of the cost of health care is a deterrent, that could create a bad situation where people stay at home, potentially infecting others,” she said. ___ HEALTH CARE TRUMP: “Preexisting conditions, 100% we take care of.” — Fox News town-hall show Thursday. THE FACTS: Far from it. People who have medical problems or a history of them are protected in the health insurance marketplace because of Obama’s Affordable Care Act, which Trump is trying to dismantle in and out of court. When Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum challenged Trump’s familiar and false assurance about preexisting protections, Trump obliquely acknowledged he has not delivered on his promise — and apparently won’t before the election. Republicans have “all pledged” that people with preexisting conditions will have their insurance protected, he said, but for that to happen, “we have to hold the Senate. We have to get the House. We have to, obviously, keep the White House.” ___ VETERANS TRUMP: “We got Choice. Nobody thought we were going to get Choice. They‘ve been trying to get Choice for over 40 years.” — Fox News interview Wednesday. THE FACTS: Yet another false telling of how the program to let some veterans get private health care at public expense came about. It’s a staple of his rhetoric. The Choice program was achieved by Obama. Trump expanded some of the conditions for qualifying for it. ___ Associated Press writers Matthew Perrone, Lauran Neergaard, Christopher Rugaber and Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar contributed to this report. ___ EDITOR’S NOTE — A look at the veracity of claims by political figures. ___  Find AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd  Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck",AP FACT CHECK: Trump's sunny side up take on coronavirus,2020-03-07T14:04:17Z,https://apnews.com/b753e66828b903730b69cbcddbd1c84d,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Donald Trump show has a consistent script. Same villains. Same nicknames. Same grievances. Same hero: himself. At raucous rallies held mostly in states that are friendly to him, the president tells audiences that he could be presidential, even Lincolnesque, if he wanted to. But that, he says, would be boring. “It’s easy to be presidential but only have about three people in front of me,” Trump said at a recent rally, before breaking into a monotone imitation of a droning politician. “Doing this takes far more talent than doing that. Doing that is very easy. This is not easy.” As he seeks reelection with little variance from the themes that brought him to power four years ago, a central challenge will be to keep those audiences satisfied and to make sure, like a great entertainer, that the act isn’t getting stale. The president retains robust approval ratings among Republicans but even that fealty will be tested as he asks voters for another four years essentially offering them not new promises but more of the same. Trump’s campaign remains highly confident it will not only retain those who backed the president in 2016, but will also expand the electorate by turning out people who did not vote four years ago, in addition to peeling off some African American and Latino males. At a rally last week in South Carolina, nearly 29% of those who registered for tickets didn’t vote in the 2016 election, according to Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale. But there are other metrics that don’t look quite as hopeful.  Trump’s Twitter following has grown to more than 73 million, up from 25 million at the start of his presidency. But the public’s engagement with the president on his favorite social media platform has diminished since his inauguration more than three years ago.  Trump’s tweets drew an average of 5.37 likes per 1,000 followers at the start of his presidency and were down to 1.29 in February, according to an analysis by Factba.se, a data analytics company that analyzes spoken and written remarks by elected officials. By comparison, top Democratic presidential contenders Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders — both of whom have a fraction of Trump’s Twitter following — tallied 2.13 and 2.73 likes per 1,000 followers respectively last month. The falling engagement numbers come as Trump, who likes to use social media as a tool to reach Americans without the contextualizing of the mainstream media, is relying on Twitter more than ever. Trump broke his personal record for most tweets or retweets in a day in January as the Senate began hearing opening arguments in his impeachment trial, sending out more than 140 posts before most Americans had left work for the day. Trump, who was in Switzerland for an economic forum at the time, mostly posted tweets and retweets attacking Democratic House impeachment managers while amplifying messaging from allies who came to his defense. Brian Ott, a Texas Tech University professor of communications and co-author of “The Twitter Presidency: Donald J. Trump and the Politics of White Rage,” says that Trump’s Twitter following has naturally expanded beyond his fervent supporters and political watchers because of his standing as the world’s most powerful leader. But his hardcore fans don’t get the same thrill from retweeting and commenting on Trump’s every post, and Russian trolls who were active on social media ahead of the 2016 election have less incentive, at the moment, to interfere and have melted away, Ott said.  Trump’s campaign speeches have also become longer, according to Factba.se. In 2017, his campaign speeches averaged 59 minutes. Thus far in 2020, he’s clocking in at an average of 80.7 minutes. “An overwhelming percentage of his discourse is about attacking others, and he simply has more enemies now,” said Ott, explaining why Trump’s speeches may be getting longer. “He uses the campaign rallies to air grievances and he’s just got more grievances at this point and never lets go of anything.” For even his staunchest supporters — many wait hours in line to attend a rally — the president’s lengthy remarks can be tough to stick with until the end. At Trump’s rally in the swing state of North Carolina earlier this week, his speech checked in at 67 minutes, relatively tight for Trump.  But with about 20 minutes to go, dozens of rallygoers who had showed up hours early to get prime spots to stand on the floor of Charlotte’s Bojangles Coliseum headed for the exits.  Several pockets in the seated area that had been filled with men and women chanting “Four More Years!” and waving campaign signs as Trump took the stage began thinning out a full 15 minutes before the president concluded his speech. Most of those who remained until the end seemed to hang on Trump’s every word but were far less animated as they sat with their “Promises Kept” and “Women for Trump” signs laying neatly in their laps. Similar scenes played out at recent rallies in Colorado Springs and Las Vegas.  In Las Vegas, retirees Jim Haney and wife Theda Haney ran out of steam about nine hours after arriving at the arena and left before Trump finished his speech. They decided to leave early despite snagging a prime spot near the podium.  “I have no voice left,” Theda Haney said.  “I’m ready for a cup of coffee and a nap,” her husband added. Trump frequently boasts that his rallies draw more supporters that he can fit in the arena. At his rally in Colorado Springs last month, Trump crowed there were “a lot of people, thousands of people that couldn’t get in.”  Indeed, several dozen people camped overnight in sub-freezing temperatures to attend Trump’s recent rally in the military town. Some 2,000 people were turned back after the arena filled to capacity, but most stuck around for a while to watch Trump on a large screen in the parking lot. There were only a couple dozen left by the time he finished, with many shuffling their feet and huddling to ward off the cold. For some devoted Trump fans, just getting a small taste of seeing Trump campaign in the flesh is enough. Rodney Siscoe, of Fountain, Colorado, left the Colorado Springs rally after about 10 minutes, walking out with a broad smile and satisfied that he got at least a glimpse of the president in action. “It’s been a long grueling day, five hours in line, and then I just barely got in,” Siscoe said. “I’m going to head home before it gets dark and watch him in the comfort of my home.” ___ Associated Press writers Noreen Gillespie in Charlotte, North Carolina, Ken Ritter in Las Vegas and Jim Anderson in Colorado Springs, Colorado, contributed to this report.",Trump's challenge: keeping his act fresh in reelection year,2020-03-07T05:06:05Z,https://apnews.com/aadd8c2f155a6dc545bba33bb34d66c3,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — At Mike Bloomberg’s midtown Manhattan campaign headquarters, a team of pollsters and analysts churned out multiple tranches of data each day on the state of the Democratic race. The sophisticated data operation was supposed to be the candidate’s not-so-secret weapon, giving Bloomberg an almost real-time look at voters’ preferences in key states and allowing the campaign to rapidly move around its vast resources.  But after Joe Biden’s commanding victory  in the South Carolina primary, the numbers moved too fast for Bloomberg’s money to catch up. Voters were rapidly flocking to the former vice president — so quickly that poll results were outdated almost as fast as they landed in the Bloomberg team’s inboxes.  “Even polls that were 24 hours old, 12 hours old were out of date,” said Kevin Sheekey, Bloomberg’s campaign manager.  Just three days after Biden’s South Carolina victory, 10 more states confirmed what Bloomberg and other candidates were seeing: a stunning consolidation of support around Biden by a diverse swath of the Democratic electorate. Though Biden lost California, the night’s biggest prize, to Bernie Sanders, he closed the gap there significantly, allowing him to emerge from Super Tuesday with a lead in the all-important delegate count.  The 72 hours between the South Carolina primary and Super Tuesday pulled Biden back from the brink of elimination and propelled him to the front of the race for the Democratic nomination. His resurgence is one of the most remarkable turnabouts in modern American politics, and sets up a head-to-head competition with Sanders over who is best to take on President Donald Trump in November.  Biden’s comeback was aided by rivals who stepped aside and urged their supporters to back him; by deep connections, particularly with black voters, built up over four decades in politics that helped him overcome significant gaps in his campaign operations in key states; and a growing fear among more moderate Democrats  that Biden was the party’s last best hope to stop Sanders, a Vermont senator and self-described democratic socialist, from clinching the nomination.  This account of those three crucial days is based on interviews with a dozen campaign operatives and political allies of the candidates, some of whom insisted on anonymity in order to discuss internal deliberations.  —- The morning after Biden’s thunderous, 30-point victory in South Carolina, the Democratic presidential field descended on Selma, Alabama, to commemorate the bridge crossing where civil rights marchers were attacked in 1965.  One had already made a private decision to drop out of the race, and another was weighing whether to do the same.  Pete Buttigieg had spent Saturday night huddled in his hotel room at a Hampton Inn in Americus, Georgia, on a conference call with top aides. One by one, Buttigieg’s aides gave their assessment: The road ahead was bleak.  It’s not where Buttigieg expected to find himself after effectively tying Sanders in Iowa and finishing a close second in New Hampshire. But he didn’t get the burst of momentum out of those states that his campaign had hoped. And while his advisers had expected Biden to win in South Carolina, the margin of victory was surprising. On the late-night conference call, Buttigieg’s advisers struggled to outline how he would emerge from Super Tuesday in solid position in the delegate count.  Buttigieg agreed with his team’s assessment: It was time to get out.  Senior campaign advisers hurriedly made plans for a concession speech back in Indiana, while Buttigieg dutifully pressed on through his schedule of events on Sunday, including the march in Selma. Between events, he called supporters to let them know his campaign was ending.  Chris Cabaldon, the mayor of West Sacramento, California, was among those who received a call. The candidate seemed a little “shaken,” Cabaldon said, but maintained he was comfortable with his decision.  “I think it was pretty clear he felt not just at peace, but he had a new mission,” Cabaldon said.  Buttigieg also tried to reach Biden, but his team initially had the wrong telephone number. When the two men finally spoke, Buttigieg told the former vice president he was weighing an endorsement, but didn’t make a firm commitment.  Guiding Buttigieg’s decision was a conversation he had earlier Sunday night with Barack Obama. The former president, who has stayed stridently neutral throughout the primary, had long been a fan of Buttigieg, identifying him as one of the Democratic Party’s next generation of leaders.  Obama congratulated Buttigieg on his campaign and counseled him on a possible endorsement, according to a person with knowledge of the call. Obama didn’t push Buttigieg to endorse a specific candidate, but they talked through factors to consider.  By Monday morning, Buttigieg was ready to back Biden. His campaign quietly coordinated with Biden’s campaign, which sent a private plane to South Bend to ferry Buttigieg to Dallas for an endorsement event.  —- Sen. Amy Klobuchar was also among the candidates who gathered in Selma. After a surprise third-place finish in New Hampshire and a sudden infusion of cash, her campaign was struggling to keep pace with the campaign’s intense primary calendar.  Klobuchar had spent Sunday morning talking with her own advisers about the path forward. The senator’s home state of Minnesota was among those voting on Super Tuesday, and the campaign’s internal polling showed Klobuchar ahead.  The way Klobuchar saw it, she had two choices: stay in to win Minnesota and relish in the glow of a home state victory, or drop out and help Biden win the state.  Klobuchar reached her decision in Selma, as she sat inside Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church.  “I was in that church in Selma that morning and I was thinking what is better here? What is better for our country?” she said on NBC’s “Today Show.” Klobuchar privately concluded she needed to step aside.  Still, she hoped for one last rally in her home state before she announced her decision. It wasn’t to be.  Protesters interrupted Klobuchar’s campaign event at a suburban Minneapolis high school, calling on her to drop out over her handling of a 2002 murder case that sent a black 17-year-old to prison for life while she was a county prosecutor. The rally was abruptly canceled. Klobuchar got back on the campaign’s charter plane and headed to Utah, where she had a morning event scheduled in Salt Lake City. But she left her aides with instructions: Because time was running out before Super Tuesday, she wanted to hold one event to both announce the end of her campaign and appear with Biden to declare her support for the former vice president.  Campaign manager Justin Buoen and two other campaign aides started Googling where Biden would be on Monday. He had events in Texas, and a nighttime rally in Dallas seemed the most feasible.  Beyond logistics, there was an added bonus to picking the Dallas event. A joint Biden-Klobuchar rally was all but certain to be carried live on cable television.  And it was scheduled for the same time Sanders would be holding a rally in Minnesota.  —- For Biden, the three days between South Carolina and Super Tuesday were dizzying.  The campaign had been running on fumes through the opening months of the year. Disappointing finishes in the opening contests scared off donors, and the campaign’s coffers were running perilously low.  But Biden appeared more at home in South Carolina, where his family had vacationed for years and where he had deep ties to state officials and voters. Ahead of the primary, he’d secured the endorsement of Rep. James Clyburn, the highest-ranking African American in Congress, whose backing for Biden had come with a dose of tough love about the ways the campaign needed to improve if Biden had any hope of securing the nomination.  Heading into the Saturday primary, Biden’s campaign was hoping to pull out a win with a margin of victory in the double digits. Biden went on to carry the state by 30 points.  “This is the night Bernie Sanders began to unravel,” Dick Harpootlian, a South Carolina state senator and longtime Biden backer, said at the victory party that night.  At campaign headquarters in Philadelphia, phones began to ring. Establishment Democrats who had held off endorsing and donors who had been sitting on the sidelines were suddenly expressing interest. One of the centrist Democrats who had backed Biden in the lead-up to South Carolina was Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, whose state was among those voting on Super Tuesday.  When Kaine first announced his endorsement and appeared with Biden, he sensed that many voters in Virginia were still undecided. But the morning after Biden’s South Carolina win, Kaine said the shift in his state was palpable.  “I had people just coming up to me saying, ‘Hey, I saw that, I’m really glad you did that,’” Kaine said. “People were deciding late, and they were looking for how to figure this out.” On Super Tuesday, Biden’s margin of victory in Virginia was about as large as it was in South Carolina. His campaign had just one office in the state and had spent less than $200,000 on television advertising compared with $12 million for Bloomberg.  —— By the next morning, Bloomberg, too, would be out of the race.  He’d plunged more than a half-billion dollars into his primary campaign, but failed to win a single state.  Bloomberg’s path to the nomination was always contingent on a Biden collapse, and for weeks, the polling the data-driven billionaire consumed backed up that bet.  But Bloomberg’s own favorable ratings took a serious tumble in the campaign’s internal polling after a poor debate performance in February in which Sen. Elizabeth Warren and others berated him for the stop-and-frisk policy he oversaw as mayor of New York and his company’s non-disclosure agreements with dozens of women.  After South Carolina, the campaign’s polling showed the race was rapidly shifting away from Bloomberg. With no financial restrictions, and significant resources already spent, the campaign decided to press forward to Super Tuesday with a long-shot hope of overperforming.  By night’s end, Bloomberg wasn’t close to contention for any of the 14 states. Biden won in Minnesota, in Texas, in Massachusetts — all states where he had a scant campaign operation and little advertising on the air.  The former mayor arrived at his midtown campaign headquarters by about 8 a.m. Wednesday for one last look at the data.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — Former Vice President Joe Biden has put an exclamation point on his Super Tuesday victories by winning the most delegates on the presidential primary calendar’s biggest night. The Associated Press has allocated more than 92% of the 1,344 delegates that were up for grabs on Tuesday, and Biden has such a commanding lead that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders cannot catch up as the remaining votes from that day’s 14 state primaries are counted. Biden built his delegate lead on Tuesday by racking up huge victories in Alabama, North Carolina and Virginia, while scoring a narrow win in Texas. In all, Biden won 10 states and Sanders won four. “Look, not long ago the press and the pundits declared this campaign dead, but this week we saw tremendous support across the nation,” Biden told supporters by phone Friday evening. “We changed the whole narrative.” Sanders won California and three other states — Colorado, Utah and his home state of Vermont. Although Sanders won the biggest state, California, he didn’t rack up the commanding lead required to surpass Biden’s haul. Biden has won at least 610 delegates from Tuesday’s contests, while Sanders has won at least 513, according to the AP delegate count. There are 102 delegates still to be allocated.  Most of the delegates still not allocated are in California, with the next biggest chunks in Colorado and Utah. Despite Sanders winning all three states, he has already been awarded the largest share of delegates in those states. Many of the delegates are being withheld because it is unclear whether former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg will finish above the 15% threshold in California, which would score him a significant number of statewide delegates. Regardless of whether Bloomberg reaches the threshold, Sanders can’t catch Biden because many of the remaining delegates would then go to Biden. Bloomberg dropped out of the presidential race on Wednesday. Overall, Biden has 664 delegates to Sanders’ 573. Sanders started the week with a six-delegate lead. Biden’s performance was all the more remarkable considering his slow start in the first three contests. Less than a month ago, Biden didn’t win a single delegate in New Hampshire.  The contest could now become a drawn-out two-man battle for delegates to win the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in July. It takes a majority of pledged delegates won in primaries and caucuses — 1,991 — to win the nomination on the first ballot. With only two viable candidates left in the race, the prospect of a contested convention is remote. The race now enters a key stretch as voters in 10 states cast ballots over the next two weeks. Sanders scrapped an appearance in Mississippi to campaign in Michigan — the largest prize on Tuesday, when six states representing 352 delegates vote. Sanders’ move was an acknowledgement that he stands little chance of blunting Biden’s edge with black voters in the South and must focus on fighting back in the Midwest. Four states vote on March 17, including delegate-rich Illinois, Ohio and Florida, where Sanders could struggle because of the state’s older electorate and his recent praise of Cuban leader Fidel Castro. When Sanders ran against Hillary Clinton in 2016, Clinton won in Florida, Illinois and Ohio — the three states with the most delegates at stake in the mid-March primaries. In Florida, the biggest prize of the next two weeks, Clinton nearly doubled Sanders’ vote. ___ Riccardi reported from Denver.

"CAMP MURRAY, Wash. (AP) — Vice President Mike Pence decided silence was the way to go. Soon after President Donald Trump asked him to lead the U.S. government’s response to the coronavirus outbreak, Pence was on the phone with Washington’s Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee, whose state is at the epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S.  Inslee told Pence that it would be best if the Trump administration “stuck to the science and told the truth” on the mounting public health crisis — and broadcast his prickly advice on Twitter. But when the vice president traveled to Washington state Thursday, Pence opted not to punch back at Inslee — to the dismay of Trump. Instead, Pence heaped compliments on the governor for helping federal and state officials collaborate in a “seamless way.”  As the virus continues to spread through U.S. communities and ravage the stock market, Trump and Pence have been a study in contrasts in their public response.  Trump grumbles that Democrats and the news media are needlessly fueling panic and has a ready retort for any critic. Pence, for his part, walks a fine line — doling out frequent praise for the boss’s performance, taking pains to avoid contradicting Trump’s questionable public health pronouncements and trying to foster bipartisan cooperation for a “whole of America” approach to containing the virus.  It’s a huge moment for Pence — arguably the biggest since Trump picked him to be his vice presidential candidate.  If he can help Trump contain the outbreak and steady the stock market, it could have an immense impact not just on public health and the economy, but on the president’s reelection bid, and in the process elevate his own standing for a potential 2024 run. A botched response, too, could have enormous implications for Trump and Pence politically and for the spread of the virus. Pence has scaled back — but not ended — his political travel to deal with the virus. But Trump aides believe the vice president’s task force role gives the president more leeway to maintain his own political travel during a crucial part of the election year, when he’s trying to take advantage of divisions in the Democratic field to boost his campaign in November.  Trump continues to play down concerns about the virus, advising Americans to “be calm” and that “it will go away.” He also frequently takes credit for saving lives by acting early on to restrict travel to the U.S. from China.  Pence avoids publicly contradicting Trump but speaks more soberly about the impact as members of his coronavirus team caution that the virus could continue to spread in the U.S. before health officials are able to develop vaccines and therapies. Pence’s tight spot — wedged between the medical experts and the president — was fully evident Friday. Trump, during a visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, told reporters he had told Pence not to be complimentary of Inslee and called the governor “a snake.” The president also pivoted from talk about a “perfect” test for the new coronavirus to his “perfect” phone call with Ukraine’s president last summer that spurred his impeachment. “We have a lot of problems with the governor, the governor of Washington,” Trump said of Inslee. “So Mike may be happy with, him but I’m not.” Pence, at a later White House briefing, had to fend off reporters’ questions about whether Trump’s comments about Inslee and impeachment reflected a lack of seriousness about combating the virus. He delivered a straight-faced defense: “I promise you, President Trump has no higher priority than the health and safety of the American people.” After the latest salvo by Trump, Inslee snapped back on Twitter that he wished Trump and Pence “could get on the same page.” A day earlier the vice president also defended Trump’s rejection of the World Health Organization’s 3.4% mortality rate estimate for those who contract the coronavirus. Pence said Trump’s doubts were valid. “I think the president’s point was the world is still discovering the scope of the coronavirus, because many people who contract the coronavirus have no symptoms,” Pence said. “I support the president’s judgment that we’re going to continue to learn more about this.” Since taking over as the virus point person, Pence has filled his schedule with meetings with top officials from nursing homes, medical labs, airlines and other industries to discuss the way forward. On Thursday, he scrapped plans for a fundraiser in Wisconsin and a campaign rally in Minnesota to focus his travels instead on the virus. He set off on a grueling a 17-hour trip  in which he visited the suburban Minneapolis headquarters of 3M, which manufactures surgical and healthcare masks, before flying to Washington state to meet with Inslee and state emergency response leaders. His long hours have even caught the eye of Trump, who can be stingy with praise for subordinates. “Mike Pence is working 20 hours a day or more on this,” Trump said Thursday. But some Democrats remain skeptical that Pence is the right person for the task.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts were among those who questioned the wisdom of picking Pence. They noted that as governor of Indiana, Pence faced criticism for being slow to authorize a needle exchange program in the southern part of the state when it saw a surge of people infected with HIV in 2015. But Pence also appears to be winning over some Democrats.  During Pence’s 3M visit, Democratic Gov. Tim Walz said the vice president had shown a collaborative mindset in the early going that indicated he understood that governors and state public health officials were at the tip of the spear in battling the virus. Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., was among Democrats who questioned picking Pence because of his track record. But this week, after a House briefing by Pence’s team, Cicilline said, “It’s clear to me that the administration is beginning to understand the gravity of this epidemic and this public health crisis.” The first coronavirus case hit American shores in late January, a moment of peak partisanship as Trump’s impeachment trial edged to a close. As Republican and Democratic lawmakers began working on a spending bill for the coronavirus outbreak, mistrust of Trump among Democrats was still running high. As a result, some even small gestures by Pence have taken Democrats by surprise. After Pence and his team of experts had finished briefing Republican senators at their regular weekly luncheon earlier this week, they trooped over to the Democrats’ lunch to give a presentation and take questions. Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat, said “it’s the first time I can remember” that Pence had come to the weekly Democratic luncheon.  The Capitol is well-trod ground for Pence, who served in the House for a dozen years during the Bush and Obama administrations.  Senators of both parties who met with him described his style in the coronavirus talks as credible and in control. He got high marks for ceding the microphone to the public health experts in his entourage. During the 2014-2015 Ebola crisis, former President Barack Obama faced some criticism from public health officials for being slow to respond initially. But the criticism eventually turned to praise as Obama nudged Congress to make a $5.4 billion emergency appropriation and sent 3,000 U.S. troops to West Africa to help with the international response. Now Trump, with Pence’s help, is looking for the same kind of turnaround. “Did we stumble out of the blocks?” observed Donna Shalala, a Florida Democrat who served as health and human services secretary during the Clinton administration. “We always stumble out of the blocks.” ___ Associated Press writers Laurie Kellman, Zeke Miller, Mary Clare Jalonick and Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar in Washington contributed reporting.",Pence walks fine line on coronavirus response,2020-03-06T19:34:30Z,https://apnews.com/19376394fdac9b7e700a5ef51ff6ad6e,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — In the midst of one of the most daunting crises of his administration, President Donald Trump announced he had made a major staff overhaul, replacing his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney with Republican Rep. Mark Meadows. While much of the country was focused on the spreading coronavirus, Trump announced the surprise reshuffle by Friday night tweet, saying Mulvaney would become the U.S. special envoy for Northern Ireland.  “I have long known and worked with Mark, and the relationship is a very good one,” he wrote, thanking Mulvaney — who never shook his “acting” title — “for having served the Administration so well.” The long-rumored move comes as Trump has been pulling together a team of loyalists and allies ahead of what is expected to be a bitter reelection fight. But the timing — as his administration was already facing criticism over its handling of the outbreak — threatened to exacerbate concerns about the government’s ability to protect the nation from a virus that has now infected more than 100,000 people worldwide. Meadows will be Trump’s fourth chief of staff in as many years. Mulvaney had been leading the administration’s interagency response to the virus until Trump designated Vice President Mike Pence to lead the whole-of-government effort more than a week ago.  It was just one of a long series of downgrades for Mulvaney, whose relationship with Trump began to sour not long after he was named to the position in December 2018. Indeed, Trump had been eyeing the change for many months, according to people familiar with his thinking, but wanted to wait until after the impeachment saga was over to make his move.  Meadows, the onetime leader of the House Freedom Caucus, is a longtime Trump confidant and sounding board, whose political instincts Trump respects. He announced last year that he would not be seeking reelection for his North Carolina House seat, and said he expected to join Trump’s team in some capacity, though it was not clear in what role.  He was officially offered the job Thursday, according to one of the people familiar with the matter, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the changes publicly. Mulvaney was informed Friday. Some outside advisers had cautioned Trump that making such a high-profile switch during the coronavirus crisis would rattle markets craving stability, and his decision to make the announcement after Wall Street had closed Friday was partly informed by those concerns, the people said.  First elected in the post-Tea Party wave of 2012, Meadows quickly established himself as a leader of a new generation of conservative Republicans on Capitol Hill. He served as chairman of the unyielding Freedom Caucus, and his antics in the House helped spur Speaker John Boehner’s sudden retirement. As Trump ascended in 2016, Meadows switched from his earlier backing of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and — urged on by his wife — joined the Trump train. Since then he has proven himself an unwavering Trump ally. A skilled negotiator, Meadows is seen as both a leader and an outlier among Republicans on Capitol Hill. Meadows was central to talks on the failed effort to repeal Obamacare and pass the GOP tax cuts. But in many ways, he remains his own counsel, with a skill set and status that may serve him well in Trump’s White House. Meadows has also made clear to the White House and those close to the president that he has no plans to try to rein in Trump, as others — like Mulvaney’s predecessor, retired four-star Gen. John Kelly — have tried and failed to do. Having seen how Kelly’s efforts to impose military order had grated on Trump and antagonized outside allies, Mulvaney, a former congressman from South Carolina, took a laissez-faire approach, making clear he believed his job was to manage the staff and not the president. He adopted the “Let Trump be Trump” mantra that had served others in Trump’s orbit well and focused instead on trying to boost staff morale and wooing lawmakers at the Camp David presidential retreat. But while he never irritated Trump and outside allies, Mulvaney had been relegated to the sidelines even before a disastrous mid-October press conference in which he insisted quid pro quo was normal when it came to foreign policy, undercutting the president’s position that there was no such thing in his dealings with Ukraine. Still, his allies had repeatedly brushed off rumblings of his imminent departure and had said as recently as last month that he planned to stay at least through the election in November. Trump had other plans. Ever since he was acquitted by the Senate on the impeachment charges, Trump has been on a tear to rid his administration of those he deems insufficiently loyal. And he has been assembling a team of trusted confidants as he prepares for a tough reelection fight. Still, one person close to Mulvaney insisted he was pleased with the decision to bring in Meadows, noting the two were friends and had served together on the Freedom Caucus. Indeed, they said Mulvaney had raised the idea of Meadows as chief of staff before Trump had tapped Mulaney for the job, and said he discussed the plan with Trump following his trip to India last week. ___ Lemire reported from New York.

"The Democratic National Committee has ratcheted up the threshold to qualify for its next presidential debate, requiring candidates to have picked up at least 20% of convention delegates allocated in state primary contests. The new rules announced Friday for the March 15 debate in Arizona will allow former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders to participate but will likely exclude Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. Gabbard has struggled to attract support in the contest and has picked up only two delegates — from the U.S. territory of American Samoa, where she was born. By comparison,  Biden has more than 660 delegates, while Sanders has over 570. On Twitter late Friday, Gabbard urged Biden and Sanders to let her join the debate. “I’m sure you would agree that our Democratic nominee should be a person who will stand up for what is right,” she tweeted. “So I ask that you have the courage to do that now in the face of the DNC’s effort to keep me from participating in the debates.” A two-person debate would be the party’s smallest yet. Ten previous debates had at least six candidates, but many candidates have dropped out  since then. Only Biden, Sanders and Gabbard remain in the Democratic race. The DNC’s new rules require a candidate to meet the delegate threshold by March 15 and pick up more delegates in elections to be held Tuesday in a handful of states, including delegate-rich Michigan. The party said it will calculate the delegates awarded by adding together those allocated in counts by The Associated Press or CNN to all candidates, including those who were awarded delegates in earlier states but have since dropped out of the race. ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.”",New qualifications for next debate likely rule out Gabbard,2020-03-06T20:19:19Z,https://apnews.com/55661d0f1edf9e18d950ad80cfee2a74,AP
"ATLANTA (AP) — Joe Biden’s presidential campaign is plowing $12 million into a six-state ad buy ahead of the March 10 and March 17 primaries, his largest single advertising effort of the 2020 campaign and a demonstration of his resurgent campaign’s new financial footing.  The former vice president is using two television and digital ads, one a spot touting his relationship with President Barack Obama, the other a new counter to rival Bernie Sanders’ current ad campaign hammering Biden on his Social Security record.  The purchase, Biden’s first since his commanding South Carolina primary victory and Super Tuesday surge generated an influx of donor support, underscores that both Biden and Sanders now have the wherewithal to fight it out on the airwaves as long as the nominating fight continues.  A new Biden ad, “Always,” defends against Sanders’ characterization that Biden is a threat to Social Security benefits, a contention the Vermont senator has made for months but ratcheted up since Biden climbed past him in the national delegate count after winning 10 out of 14 Super Tuesday states.  “Joe Biden has always been a strong supporter of Social Security. Biden will increase Social Security benefits and protect it for generations to come,” a narrator intones, before turning the matter back on Sanders. “Negative ads will only help Donald Trump. It’s time we bring our party together.”  A Sanders ad airing in upcoming primary states features Senate audio from a 1990s debate on a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution. Biden, then a Delaware senator, talks of his work on long-term budget deals that could have curbed some entitlement spending.  The second Biden ad, “Service,” features video of Obama awarding Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom shortly before the pair ended their second terms in national office. “Joe’s candid, honest counsel made me a better president and a better commander in chief,” Obama says in the video, touting Biden’s various roles in his administration. “All of this makes him the finest vice president we have ever seen. The best part is he’s nowhere close to finished.” Obama has been a shadow throughout the 2020 contest, with Biden invoking their relationship regularly as he campaigns. Other candidates alternated between criticizing part of the Obama record, such as when Julian Castro hammered Biden in an early debate over Obama-era deportations, and embracing Obama, as billionaire Mike Bloomberg did in his ubiquitous television advertising campaign. Biden expressed frustration at both tacks, defending Obama’s record and noting that his old boss was staying out of the primary and not endorsing anyone. While that may be the case, Obama has crept back in recently. The former president called Biden to congratulate him on his South Carolina victory Feb. 29, a source with knowledge of the conversation confirmed. With neither Obama or Biden disputing that account, some observers read it as the former president tacit nod toward his vice president as the field winnowed. Sources also confirm that Obama has seen the ad using clips from Biden’s White House medal ceremony.  Separately, Biden has in recent weeks reminded voters that Sanders, a democratic socialist well to Obama’s left, once floated the idea of a primary campaign against the president in his 2012 re-election year.  Still, Social Security may promise to be the bigger fight between Biden and Sanders in the coming weeks. Some Sanders aides have for months surfaced various comments and votes from Biden over the years on entitlement spending, without acknowledging that Sanders himself in the 1990s expressed openness to Social Security “adjustments,” a word that some Sanders allies argued Biden and others used as a euphemism for cuts. Then a representative from Vermont, Sanders also praised an overhaul of the popular safety net program that reduced benefits and increased some taxes under President Ronald Reagan, a Republican.  As presidential candidates in 2020, Sanders and Biden each have proposed protecting and expanding Social Security, so it’s not clear whether either candidate will be able to capitalize on the matter. The Biden campaign on social media this week has pushed back at Sanders by noting that Trump and his fellow Republicans are the more realistic threats to Social Security.  Biden told donors via telephone on Friday that he wanted to avoid “a negative bloodbath” with Sanders. The new advertising effort includes $8 million on television, with the $4 million spread across radio and digital platforms. The ads will appear across Michigan, Missouri and Mississippi ahead of the March 10 primaries, and in Florida, Illinois and Ohio ahead of the March 17 primaries.  Currently, Biden has 664 delegates to Sanders’ 573, according to Associated Press calculations, with some delegates remaining to be allocated from Super Tuesday. More than 900 delegates are at stake the next two weeks; 1,991 are needed for the nomination.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday that House Democrats will stay at work this week as “captains of the ship” confronting the coronavirus outbreak as President Donald Trump came to Capitol Hill to confer with Senate Republicans about his proposed payroll tax relief. The Trump administration and lawmakers are racing to respond to the epidemic and the related financial storm in what appears to be a mounting political and policy standoff over the best approach. Democrats are preparing a package of aid that includes unemployment insurance and sick pay for working families struggling to keep paychecks coming as the outbreak disrupts workplaces. A vote could come as soon as this week or push to mid-March. “We are the captains of the ship,” Pelosi said during the closed-door meeting, according to a person in the room unauthorized to discuss the private caucus and granted anonymity. “We are the last to leave.” But time is short as Congress heads toward its scheduled break next week. Meanwhile, lawmakers were given new instructions on how to protect themselves at the Capitol, with the House’s attending physician asking them to stop shaking hands or touching people during greetings — he recommended the split-fingers Star Trek greeting instead.  Crowds are the norm in the Capitol and handshakes are coin of the realm there, even between political foes. But about a half dozen lawmakers have placed themselves in quarantine after being exposed to someone who had the virus, and the norm has been upended. During House Democrats’ closed session, one lawmaker, Rep. Raul Ruiz, D-Ca., who is a doctor, noted that the average age in Congress is 57, some lawmakers have underlying health conditions and their work requires them to fly back and forth between home and the capital. Still, Pelosi implored lawmakers to keep working to strengthen the country’s defenses. Rather than picking up their own coffee and snacks for the breakfast meeting, lawmakers were served by staff from the buffet and warned off touching the serving utensils. Trump met health insurers at the White House earlier and vowed to help the beleaguered cruise-ship and airline industries.  His top economic advisers accompanied him to Capitol Hill to brief Senate Republicans on his plan to ask Congress to pass payroll tax relief and other quick measures. On Monday, the president told reporters he is seeking “very substantial relief” to the payroll tax. Trump also said he was seeking help for hourly-wage workers to ensure they’re “not going to miss a paycheck” and “don’t get penalized for something that’s not their fault.” But so far, the president’s approach, based on tax breaks, is receiving a cool response from Democrats as well as Republicans from his own party who say it’s too soon to consider fresh spending from Capitol Hill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell opened the chamber saying only that Republicans “look forward to discussing” the ideas “so we can all consider the best ways to move forward.” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and adviser Larry Kudlow are expected at the weekly GOP lunch. The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, said the virus outbreak demands a “health care” solution. Democrats are proposing affordable testing, more unemployment benefits and paid leave for working families affected by the virus. “The administration seems to believe that the answer to any problem is another tax cut,” Schumer said. “The best way to ensure economic security for the American people is to deal directly with the coronavirus itself. It was not immediately clear how Trump was aiming to provide assistance to employees weighing whether to stay home because of illness — a crucial aim of public health officials seeking to curtail the spread of the virus. One mechanism, backed by the Trump-allied National Association of Manufacturers, involves a proposed tax credit for employers who pay employees who are quarantined. Trump stepped forward with the contours of an initiative Monday after markets dropped sharply and as the outbreak spread. markets recovered from some of the losses Tuesday, reacting positively to the prospects for an economic boost from Washington. Several Trump confidants have disclosed they are isolating themselves after potential exposure to the virus; one lawmaker traveled with the president from Florida on Air Force One on Monday; another was his just-tapped new chief of staff. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which monitors financial markets, encouraged employees at its Washington headquarters to work from home after an employee there had respiratory symptoms and was referred for coronavirus testing.  And Defense Secretary Mark Esper postponed a trip to India, Pakistan and Uzbekistan that was to begin Monday, citing the coronavirus crisis, Pentagon press secretary Alyssa Farah said Tuesday. She said he would remain in the U.S to help manage the Pentagon response.  At the Capitol, Democratic lawmakers were told by the House chief administrative officer behind closed doors that the office could support up to 10,000 staff members teleworking if need be. Laptop orders were being expedited and cyber-security measures reviewed. Trump returned to Washington on Monday accompanied by Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, who later went into a voluntary quarantine. He was one of several GOP lawmakers who were exposed to a person at last month’s Conservative Political Action Conference who tested positive for the virus. His office said he was “mid-flight” on Air Force One when CPAC informed his staff that he had been in contact with the attendee who had the virus. Once the plane landed, Gaetz was immediately tested. Vice President Mike Pence, who also spoke at CPAC, said he has not been tested for the virus. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Trump has not been tested because he has not had “prolonged close contacts” with any patients and “does not have any symptoms.” The White House has been convening meetings with an array of travel and healthcare industry representatives, and was set to host Wall Street executives at the White House on Wednesday to discuss the economic fallout of the epidemic. Vast numbers of visitors come to the Hill, especially at this time of year when advocacy groups arrange “fly-in” trips to lobby and speak to lawmakers, and school groups descend for tours.  In one manifestation of lawmaking in the age of the coronavirus, Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., approached a Republican colleague on the House floor Monday for a routine congratulatory handshake after the chamber approved a bill expanding a visa program. “Shake or bump?” Neal asked Rep. Kelly Armstrong, R-N.D.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department must give Congress secret grand jury testimony from special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday — giving the House a win in a separation-of-powers clash with the Trump administration. The three-judge panel said in a 2-1 opinion that House Democrats were entitled to the material as part of their ongoing investigation into President Donald Trump’s conduct. The ruling upholds a lower court opinion from last year. In her opinion, Judge Judith Rogers wrote that because Mueller himself “stopped short” of reaching conclusions about Trump’s conduct to avoid stepping on the House’s impeachment power, ” the Committee has established that it cannot ‘fairly and diligently’ make a final determination about the conduct described in both volumes of the Mueller Report ‘without the grand jury material referenced’ therein.”  The ruling softens the blow of a loss the House endured two weeks ago when judges on the same court said they would not force former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify before Congress. The split decisions leave neither the administration nor Congress with a clear upper hand in their inter-branch dispute. Even so, the practical impact of the decision is unclear.  Though lawyers for the Democrats had said the grand jury material could be used for additional articles of impeachment against Trump, the Senate impeachment trial over the president’s interactions with Ukraine ended weeks ago in an acquittal. The case is one of several disputes between the Trump administration and Congress that courts have grappled with in recent months.  The two sides had been similarly at odds on the question of whether McGahn could be forced to testify about Trump’s behavior during the Russia investigation. The appeals court ruled in a recent 2-1 decision that judges had no role to play in that dispute and dismissed the case. Grand jury testimony is typically treated as secret, in part to protect the privacy of people who are not charged or are considered peripheral to a criminal investigation. But several exceptions allow for the material to be turned over, including if it is in connection with a judicial proceeding.  The House argued that the impeachment inquiry met that definition, and it sought copies of testimony referenced in Mueller’s 448-page report on Russian election interference and potential obstruction by Trump. U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell sided with the House last October in ordering that the material be turned over. The Justice Department appealed that decision, with lawyers arguing that the material sought by the House had no relevance to the impeachment inquiry and that the House already had ample information about the investigation. Several dozen witnesses appeared before Mueller’s grand jury, including former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. ____ Associated Press writer Mark Sherman in Washington contributed to this report.",Court: House entitled to Mueller probe grand jury testimony,2020-03-10T16:31:05Z,https://apnews.com/05068707d7c680a28bea89e3b7b697b5,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — Major insurers pledged to cover coronavirus tests at no cost to patients at the White House Tuesday, but those assurances — while welcome — may not resolve public concerns about testing. For one, insurers can’t control the availability of the tests themselves. While the capacity for labs to test more patients is growing daily, the U.S. still has nowhere near the capacity for millions of tests that public health officials say are needed. What’s more, a test for the virus is only part of diagnosing and treating a patient. Other tests and scans may be needed, not just the coronavirus test. And if a patient requires treatment for viral illness, that would involve additional costs. CEOs of major health insurance companies such as UnitedHealth, Anthem, and Humana, along with the leaders of industry trade groups like the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, met with President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence to underscore commitments that the companies have been announcing individually in recent days. Pence said the industry representatives agreed that coronavirus tests would be covered at no cost to patients, and to cover telemedicine related to the outbreak. The companies pledged no surprise billing in connection with coronavirus. “We want the American people to know that they are covered through private insurance, they are covered through Medicare, Medicaid, and there will be no surprise billing,” Pence said. Trump said, “I think tremendous progress is being made.” Insurers, he added, are “willing to do things for the people and their customers ... that normally I don’t think they’d be doing.” While people who suspect they’ve been sickened by the virus should not delay calling a doctor, insurance experts say consumers should still call their insurance plan as a follow-up to learn what medical services are fully covered and which ones may involve an out-of-pocket cost. “The industry is not a monolith,” said Karen Pollitz of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. “We don’t have a rule yet that says all insurers must do ‘x,’ so flip your insurance card over and call the 800 number.” The coronavirus test uses samples taken from the patient with swabs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends at least two swabs, one from the throat and the other from the nose, where the virus tends to enter and cause an infection. The samples are then sent off to a limited number of government, academic and private labs that can run the test. The lab process can take roughly 4 to 6 hours. Altogether, it can take several days to ship a sample and receive the results back. Last week the government announced that federal programs like Medicare, Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, and children’s health insurance would cover coronavirus testing. Major insurers also stepped forward to announce that they would remove cost barriers for customers who need virus tests. With older people considered a high-risk group for COVID-19 — the illness caused by the virus — Medicare is reminding the public that diagnostic lab tests ordered by a doctor are generally covered at no charge under program rules. But copays and deductibles apply for outpatient imaging tests such as CT scans, and hospital stays are also subject to a deductible.  For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.  ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"DETROIT (AP) — Bernie Sanders proved his 2016 presidential bid was serious with an upset victory in Michigan powered by his opposition to free trade and appeal among working-class voters. Four years later, the state could either revive the Vermont senator’s campaign or relegate him to the role of protest candidate. Michigan and five other states already began voting early Tuesday morning in what will be a critical point in the Democratic race.  Former Vice President Joe Biden is looking to quash Sanders’ hopes and cement his own front-runner status just a week after resurrecting his beleaguered White House bid with a delegate victory on Super Tuesday. He played up his underdog story on Monday as he campaigned across Michigan, reflecting on his stutter as a child and the deaths of his first wife and young daughter.  And Biden wasn’t alone. The former vice president courted the state’s influential African American voters alongside the two most prominent black candidates previously in the 2020 race, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, who endorsed Biden in recent days as part of a broader consolidation of support among party leaders. They all appeared hand-in-hand at Biden’s final Michigan rally Monday night, also joined by the state’s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, who also endorsed the former vice president. Sanders is in an urgent fight to turn things around as the primary calendar quickly shifts to other states that could favor Biden and narrow his path to the nomination. The senator countered the parade of Democratic firepower lining up behind Biden by securing the endorsement of the Rev. Jesse Jackson and deploying Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., on his behalf. Dozens of Detroit residents voted before the sun came up at a polling place set up inside Greater Grace Temple, a mammoth church in the city that hosted funerals for Aretha Franklin and Rosa Parks. Among the voters was Tahechia Franklin, a 50-year-old who works in property management. Franklin, who voted for Bernie Sanders, said the most important issues to her are health care and “I want Trump out.” Having devoted several days to Michigan, the Vermont senator spent the eve of Tuesday’s primaries in Missouri, where he downplayed questions about electability and insisted that the “energy and excitement” of his supporters made him the strongest Democrat to run against President Donald Trump this fall.  Tuesday marks the first time voters will weigh in on the Democratic contest since it effectively narrowed to a two-person race between Sanders and Biden. It will be another test of whether Sanders can broaden his appeal among African Americans. Biden, meanwhile, must show that he can keep momentum going after his surprise Super Tuesday turnaround.  “I like his chances,” Whitmer said of the former vice president in an interview. “He knows Michigan,” the governor added. “When our back was up against the wall during the auto struggles of the past, it was Barack Obama and Joe Biden who had our backs.” That’s a reference to the Obama administration overseeing federal bailouts that helped the auto industry — the lifeblood of Michigan’s economy — weather the 2009 financial crisis. Sanders counters that he, too, voted to save the auto industry. He also says that, unlike Biden, he opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he said prompted thousands of Michigan jobs to move to Mexico since taking effect in 1994. During a campaign stop at a Detroit autoworkers plant Tuesday morning, Biden received an overwhelmingly positive response. “You’re the best damn workers in the world,” Biden shouted through a megaphone as workers in hard hats chanted “Joe.” “Wall Street didn’t build this country. You built this country.” Biden ticked off the names of six former presidential rivals who have endorsed him just in the past week during a Monday appearance with Booker in Flint, Michigan, a community that has seen auto industry jobs disappear: “They’ve all come out and endorsed at one time ... the candidate that they think can win.” And later in Detroit, he stood on stage grasping hands with Whitmer, Booker and Harris, a powerful trio of potential vice presidential picks should Biden become the Democrats’ presidential nominee.  The large rally, however, was interrupted repeatedly by protesters, who railed against Biden’s support for the North American Free Trade Agreement and his reluctance to embrace sweeping environmental proposals outlined in the so-called Green New Deal.  In a scuffle with environmental protesters in the midst of Biden’s remarks, senior adviser Symone Sanders was knocked to the ground. She was not hurt. Less than a week ago she tackled a protester who rushed the stage as Biden spoke in California. During his stop at the auto plant Tuesday, Biden again faced off in a testy exchange with a worker who accused him of “actively trying to end our Second Amendment right.” Biden responded, “You’re full of shit,” and went on to say that while he supports the Second Amendment, “Do you need 100 rounds?” Biden’s gun-control plan reinstates the assault weapons ban and includes a voluntary buyback program for assault weapons, stopping short of a mandatory buyback program that some of his opponents had supported in the primary. Other economic challenges emerged on Monday as fears about the spread of the new coronavirus shook financial markets, slicing 7.8% from the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Sanders held a roundtable with health experts in Detroit, and Biden said he would defer to health experts about whether campaign events could continue, given concerns about the spread of the virus. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert, stopped short of calling on candidates to put a pause on political rallies. Instead, he said he wouldn’t criticize someone seeking office for putting a pause on big gatherings. “If you’re talking about a campaign rally tomorrow in a place where there is no community spread, I think the judgment to have it might be a good judgment,” Fauci said Monday at a White House briefing. “If you want to talk about large gatherings in a place where you have community spread, I think that’s a judgment call.” Viral outbreaks and economic uncertainty aside, on Tuesday election-watchers had their eyes on potential problems at the polls. Early Tuesday morning, the mayor of Kansas City, Missouri, tweeted that he had been turned away from voting because “I wasn’t in the system even though I’ve voted there for 11 years.” An outstanding question going into Tuesday was whether Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who dropped out of the race last week, would endorse Biden or Sanders. So far, she’s declined to back either, an especially frustrating development for Sanders, who could use Warren’s help in unifying progressives in much the same way Biden has been able to rally moderates. Sanders has scoffed at suggestions he could drop out if he doesn’t win Michigan, but his travel schedule underscores its importance. He canceled a trip to Mississippi and instead made five campaign stops across Michigan since Friday.  Sanders won’t say if he’s personally lobbying Warren for her endorsement. He did manage to secure the backing of Jackson, who said it was no time for centrist compromise.  He jabbed Biden during a Monday appearance in downtown St. Louis, reminding a largely young crowd of the former vice president’s long record in Washington. Sanders noted that unlike Biden, he opposed the war in Iraq, Wall Street bailouts after the 2008 collapse and any talk of cuts to Social Security. “In a general election, which candidate can generate the enthusiasm and the excitement and the voter turnout we need?” Sanders asked. “If you want to defeat Trump, which all Democrats do and the majority of independents do and some Republicans do, we are that campaign.”  One of Sanders’ highest-profile supporters, Ocasio-Cortez, struck a far more conciliatory tone the day before addressing 10,000-plus on the campus of the University of Michigan on Sunday night, saying, “In order for us to win, we have to grow.”  “We must be inclusive. We must bring more people into this movement,” she said, urging Sanders supporters to shed “cynicism and exclusion” and “turn with an embracing posture, where all people are welcome in a people’s movement.”  Sanders is optimistic about Washington state on Tuesday, and Idaho and North Dakota, both states Sanders won in 2016, go to the polls Tuesday as well, though the lack of polling in both states has made them difficult to predict. But the senator’s team acknowledges he will struggle in next week’s Florida primary, where the senator’s past defense of Fidel Castro looms large. He also could face long odds in Ohio and Illinois — especially if he underperforms in Michigan. Both of those states also vote March 17. The wild card next week could be Arizona, where Sanders will be counting on strong Latino support, which lifted him to victory in California.  Sanders advisers are aware that Biden could build an insurmountable delegate lead if he runs up the score in the upcoming contests. They hope to continue doing well in the West before picking up momentum in places like delegate-rich New York, which holds its primary next month.  There’s no guarantee Sanders could last that long this time, however, given the higher expectations he now faces. Even some of those attending Sanders rallies are beginning to feel it, although his St. Louis audience was optimistic. Alec McAulay, a 19-year-old college student from St. Louis County, said Sanders has proved that he’s a true alternative to the president.  “I think Biden agrees with Trump too much, more than any Democrat should,” McAulay said.  ___ Associated Press writers Mike Householder in Detroit, Seth Borenstein in Washington and Steve Peoples in Flint, Mich., contributed to this report. ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.”",Michigan primary could make or break Sanders' campaign,2020-03-10T04:35:05Z,https://apnews.com/5b4fa2256d232ca24b2f93fff3131e99,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — The top U.S. commander for the Middle East painted a grim picture Tuesday of the peace process with the Taliban in Afghanistan, saying the current level of attacks is higher than allowed in the plan and he has no confidence the group will honor its commitments. Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie told the House Armed Services Committee that he has plans to cut the number of troops to 8,600 by the summer, but so far the U.S. “has not developed military plans” for the full withdrawal in 14 months that is called for in the peace plan signed Feb. 29. “To date, Taliban attacks are higher than we believe are consistent with an idea to actually carry out this plan,” McKenzie said. “If they’re unable to draw down the current level of attacks, then the political leadership will be able to make decisions based on that.” He added that his optimism or pessimism about the future doesn’t matter because any decisions will be based on facts and what happens on the ground. Both McKenzie and Kathryn Wheelbarger, a top Pentagon policy adviser on international affairs, said America’s complete troop withdrawal is contingent on whether the level of violence is reduced and the Taliban adheres to its commitments. McKenzie said he would recommend against that full pullout if attacks continue and the Afghan forces can’t protect their own country without direct U.S. support. Wheelbarger called the full pullout “aspirational” and said Defense Secretary Mark Esper would reassess the matter if the Taliban doesn’t abide by the agreement. The United States has begun withdrawing troops from Afghanistan, taking a step forward on its peace deal with the Taliban. And Afghan President Ashraf Ghani promised on Monday to start releasing Taliban prisoners, but by Tuesday he had not issued a decree to free them. The U.S.-Taliban deal was touted as Washington’s effort to end 18 years of war in Afghanistan. The next crucial step was to be intra-Afghan talks in which all factions including the Taliban would negotiate a road map for their country’s future. That plan has been thrown into chaos because both Ghani and his main political rival, Abdullah Abdullah were each sworn in as president in separate ceremonies Monday. Abdallah and the elections complaints commission had charged fraud in last year’s vote. Ghani, however, said Tuesday that he’d start putting together a negotiating team, and he said he would announce a decree to free the prisoners. His comments on the prisoner release came after the U.S. and a number of foreign dignitaries appeared to back his claim to the presidency by sending their representatives to his inauguration. Esper last week said “the entire process will be conditions-based, and we will retain in Afghanistan the necessary capabilities to protect our service members and allies and support the Afghan security forces.” A key challenge will be whether al-Qaida is able to resurge in Afghanistan and present a threat once again to the U.S. McKenzie was asked what evidence the U.S. has that the Taliban have cut ties with al-Qaida. He said it’s pretty clear the Taliban are actively fighting the Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan, but added that he is “less optimistic” about al-Qaida. “That’s something they (the Taliban) are going to have to demonstrate that has not yet been demonstrated,” he added, referring to the Taliban showing that it has severed ties to the extremist group that planned the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks from Afghanistan. He said the U.S. will have “ample time to see if they actually do that” before the U.S. completes a troop withdrawal. He said the key threats to the U.S. continue to be the ability of al-Qaida and the Islamic State to generate attacks against the U.S. “The best intelligence estimates tell us that if we do not maintain pressure on those two entities, that in a period of time — and you can say a year, you can say two years, you can say somewhere in between — they’re going generate the ability to do external attacks again, and that will manifest itself here in the United States,” McKenzie said.",US commander paints grim picture of Taliban peace deal,2020-03-10T15:29:42Z,https://apnews.com/65afea984ebc631c899a59bd004cb25b,AP
"DETROIT (AP) — The Latest on the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries (all times local): 11:35 a.m. Joe Biden has faced down a pro-gun worker in a testy exchange over his plan to reinstate the assault weapons ban. Biden spoke at an auto plant in Detroit on Tuesday and then was confronted by a worker in a hard hat who accused him of “actively trying to end our Second Amendment right.” Biden used an expletive to tell the worker he was “full of” it and hushed an aide who was trying to end the conversation. Biden went on to say he supports the Second Amendment but added: “Do you need 100 rounds?” The worker pointed to a “viral video” in which he alleged Biden said he would take away people’s guns. Biden replied that he “did not say that” and that the video was “lying.” Biden otherwise received an overwhelmingly positive response from the autoworkers while courting the union vote in a final push as Michigan residents vote in the presidential primary. ___ 10:55 a.m. Joe Biden has received his third endorsement from a major national gun control group in as many days, this time from the Newtown Action Alliance. The group was founded after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, which killed 26 people, including 20 children. Biden also received the support of Everytown for Gun Safety and the Brady Campaign in recent days. Newtown Action Alliance chairwoman Po Murray said Tuesday in a statement Biden’s “support for gun violence prevention has never wavered.” The group notes the former vice president was appointed by President Barack Obama to lead a gun control task force after the 2012 Newtown massacre. The endorsement is another indication Bernie Sanders’ spotty record on gun control could weigh him down in the Democratic presidential primary. Michigan and five other states are voting Tuesday at a critical point in the race.  Sanders has a D-minus rating from the National Rifle Association. But the Vermont senator has been criticized by opponents and gun control advocates for past opposition to background check legislation and support for shielding gun manufacturers from lawsuits over misuse of their guns. ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.”",The Latest: Biden faces down pro-gun worker at Detroit plant,2020-03-10T14:59:29Z,https://apnews.com/1fb4ebe120cca2d5f93305f5425de023,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — Securities and Exchange Commission employees have been encouraged to work remotely for the foreseeable future after a coronavirus scare at the agency’s Washington headquarters.  The agency, which oversees the financial markets, said it was informed Monday afternoon that a headquarters employee had received medical treatment for respiratory symptoms earlier in the day.  The employee, who was not identified, was informed by a doctor that they may have been infected with the coronavirus and was referred for testing, the SEC said in a statement.  Among other precautions, the agency “is encouraging headquarters employees to telework until further guidance,” it said.  The SEC is the first major federal agency to employ teleworking in an effort to contain the virus’ spread. It said the scattering of headquarters employees to work from their homes or other remote locations will not affect operations.  “Even with increased telework, the SEC remains able and committed to fully executing its mission on behalf of investors, including monitoring market function and working closely with other regulators and market participants,” said the agency.

"ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — The 2020 census is off and running for much of America now. The U.S. Census Bureau made a soft launch of the 2020 census website on Monday, making its form available online. On Thursday, the Census Bureau will begin mailing out notices far and wide. For the bureau, the once-a-decade head count is akin to running a sprint and marathon at the same time. It takes awhile, but there’s plenty of action throughout. “It is that intense .... counting up to 330 million people in a very diverse, very mobile population, and over 140 million housing units,” Stephen Buckner, a senior Census Bureau executive, said during a recent visit to Miami. The bureau had an official in-person launch  in January in Toksook Bay, Alaska. Mail service is spotty and internet connectivity is unreliable in remote Alaska, making door-to-door canvassing the best way to gather responses. The Alaska villages get a head start over the rest of the nation because many residents scatter each spring to subsistence hunting and fishing grounds. There has been a U.S. census every decade since 1790. The results determine how many congressional seats each state gets and how $1.5 trillion in federal spending is distributed.  The 2020 census is the first in which most people are being encouraged to answer the questions online, though people can still answer the questionnaire by telephone or by mailing back a paper form if they prefer. The notices mailed out starting this week will include a census ID that matches addresses. People filling out the form via the internet are encouraged to use the ID, but those who answer the questions online before getting their IDs still will be counted. “The best user experience is provided with a Census ID,” the bureau said in a statement Monday evening. About 80% of households receiving mailings will get notices about how to answer the questions online, and about 20% of households automatically will receive a paper ballot if there are large numbers of seniors in their neighborhood or levels of internet connectivity are low. Census workers won’t begin going door-to-door in earnest until May, when they’ll approach homes that haven’t responded and ask the questions in person. Bureau officials are monitoring the spread of the novel coronavirus, which could disrupt the door-to-door phase. If there is a major disaster, such as an epidemic, census workers instead can drop off the questionnaires at homes, with the hope that people will respond on their own, according to the bureau’s operational plan. Testifying before a U.S. House appropriations subcommittee on Tuesday, U.S. Secretary Wilbur Ross, whose department oversees the Census Bureau, said the emphasis on getting people to respond online is minimizing physical contact that could spread the virus. “We will just have to play it by ear,” Ross said. “We are ready to make responses and we will deal with the situation as it evolves.” This week also poses the first true test of the Census Bureau’s new IT systems for capturing online responses. For the past three years, the Government Accountability Office has placed the census on its list of high-risk programs, mainly because it is relying on technology that has not been used before. Last month, the bureau decided to use a backup data-collection system  for handling the online responses after officials grew concerned that the primary system would not be able to handle excessive traffic.  The online approach to answering the 2020 census questions causes Democratic U.S. Rep. Karen Bass of California, to worry it will lead to an undercount of blacks and other minorities in hard-to-count communities.  “Having the census online can be a way of continuously undercounting the black population,” Bass said last week. Perhaps the most attention given the 2020 census over the past several years has been to the failed effort by the Trump administration to put a citizenship question on the form. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected those efforts, but some worry that lingering unease  may scare off some Hispanics and immigrants from participating. “It’s a challenge every 10 years to get any American to fill out the census. Some people feel you’re invading their privacy, as though its intrusive. Some people are fearful of giving the government more information,” said U.S. Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas. “But every 10 years, that challenge has been especially tough in minority communities, who sometimes are more disconnected from government than other communities.” ___ This story has been corrected to reflect that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross testified before a House subcommittee, not a Senate subcommittee. ___ Adriana Gomez Licon contributed to this report from Miami. ___ Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter at https://twitter.com/MikeSchneiderAP",Census Bureau site goes live as counting begins in earnest,2020-03-10T14:58:39Z,https://apnews.com/3fc59096ab138fdd4795386a2987c573,AP
"MOSCOW (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump will not be coming to Moscow for Victory Day celebrations on May 9, the White House said Tuesday. The White House confirmed that Trump has declined the Kremlin invitation to attend Russia’s Victory Day celebrations on the 75th anniversary of World War II victory — the nation’s most important holiday.  Trump said last year he appreciated the invitation, but wasn’t sure if he could go as the celebration falls “right in the middle of political season.” The Kremlin confirmed receiving the White House note. “Via diplomatic channels, we have received information that the (U.S.) president will not be coming,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Tuesday, adding that it remains unclear who will represent the U.S. on the Victory Day in Moscow.  In an interview with the state-run Tass news agency, a part of which was released Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said it would be “a mistake” for world leaders not to attend the Victory Day celebrations this year.  “I think that, concerning former members of the anti‑Hitler alliance, the right thing to do would be to attend (our event), from both a domestic political stance and a moral one,” Putin said. “We look forward to seeing them and we will be glad if they come.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump pitched his proposed payroll tax break Tuesday on Capitol Hill as pressure mounts on the administration and Congress to work more vigorously to contain the coronavirus outbreak and respond to the financial fallout. Trump’s economic team joined in presenting the economic stimulus package privately to wary Senate Republicans, who have been cool to additional spending at this stage. Democrats are preparing their own package of low-cost virus testing, unemployment insurance and sick pay for workers struggling to keep paychecks coming as the outbreak disrupts workplaces. “We’re taking this unbelievably seriously,” Trump said after his meeting at the Capitol. “It will go away, just stay calm.” Asked why he has not yet been tested for the virus, after having been in close contact with several advisers and members of Congress who are now self-quarantined after exposure, Trump said: “I don’t think it’s a big deal” and “I feel very good.”  White House officials have been blindsided by the president’s sudden moves. As Trump headed to Capitol Hill, two administration officials said the proposals he was putting in play had not been completed. They were unauthorized to discuss the planning and requested anonymity.  Trump’s team offered few specifics at the closed door GOP lunch on the size of the payroll tax break or its duration, senators said. Trump has long promised to bring about an election year “tax cuts 2.0,” and seemed to be seizing on the virus fears as a way to bring about a victory on that front before November.  In addition to payroll tax relief, Trump has said he wants help for hourly-wage workers to ensure they’re “not going to miss a paycheck” and “don’t get penalized for something that’s not their fault.” He’s also mentioned small-business loans. But so far, the president’s approach, based on tax breaks, is receiving a cool response from Democrats as well as Republicans from his own party who say it’s too soon to consider fresh spending from Capitol Hill. Some Republicans endorsed Trump’s suggestion that help be provided to the beleaguered cruise-ship and airline industries. Others spoke up to push for broader economic stimulus from a bipartisan highway bill they said was shovel-ready and popular. The payroll tax plan remains a work in progress. “They didn’t get into specifics,” said the No. 2 Republican, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota. Earlier, Speaker Nancy Pelosi told House Democrats that Congress should keep working this week despite concerns about infection spreading there. “We are the captains of the ship,” Pelosi said during a closed-door meeting, according to a person in the room unauthorized to discuss the private caucus and granted anonymity. “We are the last to leave.” But time is short as Congress heads toward its scheduled break next week. Trump had Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin meet with Pelosi, whose support will be needed for any deal in the divided Congress, where Republicans hold the Senate majority but Democrats hold the House. The two have successfully negotiated in the past and Mnuchin called the meeting productive. “We’re going to work together on a bipartisan basis to figure out how we can get things done quickly,” he said. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.  The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 58,000 have so far recovered. At the U.S. Capitol, some senators said they resisted shaking Trump’s hand. Lawmakers were given new instructions on how to protect themselves, with the House’s attending physician asking them to stop shaking hands or touching people during greetings. He recommended the split-fingers Star Trek greeting instead.  Crowds are the norm in the Capitol and handshakes are coin of the realm there, even between political foes. But about a half dozen lawmakers have placed themselves in quarantine after being exposed to someone who had the virus, and the norm has been upended. During House Democrats’ closed session, one lawmaker, Rep. Raul Ruiz, D-Ca., who is a doctor, noted that the average age in Congress is 57, some lawmakers have underlying health conditions and their work requires them to fly back and forth between home and the capital. Still, Pelosi implored lawmakers to keep working to strengthen the country’s defenses. Rather than picking up their own coffee and snacks for the breakfast meeting, lawmakers were served by staff from the buffet and warned off touching the serving utensils. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was noncommittal after the meeting with Trump. He said any deal would need both both parties and chambers on board. Emphasizing the talks between Mnuchin and Pelosi, he said: “We’re hoping that he and the speaker can pull this together.” Trump spoke of a stimulus Monday after markets dropped sharply and as the outbreak spread. Markets recovered from some of the losses Tuesday, reacting positively to the prospects for an economic boost from Washington.  Yet even within the administration, there are divisions on the best approach. The payroll-tax plan found support inside the administration from Jared Kushner and Peter Navarro, among others. Other Trump aides, such as Mnuchin and Larry Kudlow, who was also on the Hill, advocated more modest measures. It was not immediately clear how Trump was aiming to provide assistance to employees weighing whether to stay home because of illness — a crucial aim of public health officials seeking to curtail the spread of the virus. One mechanism, backed by the Trump-allied National Association of Manufacturers, involves a proposed tax credit for employers who pay employees who are quarantined. At the Capitol, Democratic lawmakers were told by the House chief administrative officer behind closed doors that the office could support up to 10,000 staff members teleworking if need be. Laptop orders were being expedited and cyber-security measures reviewed. Several Trump confidants have disclosed they are isolating themselves after potential exposure to the virus; one lawmaker traveled with the president from Florida on Air Force One on Monday; another was his just-tapped new chief of staff. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which monitors financial markets, encouraged employees at its Washington headquarters to work from home after an employee there had respiratory symptoms and was referred for coronavirus testing.  And Defense Secretary Mark Esper postponed a trip to India, Pakistan and Uzbekistan that was to begin Monday, citing the coronavirus crisis, Pentagon press secretary Alyssa Farah said Tuesday. She said he would remain in the U.S to help manage the Pentagon response.  ___ Associated Press writers Lauran Neergaard, Andy Taylor, Kevin Freking, Jill Colvin, Bob Burns, Andrew Taylor and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — The top U.S. commander for the Middle East painted a grim picture Tuesday of the peace process with the Taliban in Afghanistan, saying the current level of violence is higher than allowed in the plan and that he will recommend against full withdrawal if that continues. Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie told the House Armed Services Committee that he has plans to cut the number of troops to 8,600 by the summer, but so far the U.S. “has not developed military plans” for the full withdrawal in 14 months that is called for in the peace plan signed Feb. 29. “To date, Taliban attacks are higher than we believe are consistent with an idea to actually carry out this plan,” McKenzie said. “If they’re unable to draw down the current level of attacks, then the political leadership will be able to make decisions based on that.” He added that he has no confidence the group will honor its commitments, but said his optimism or pessimism about the future doesn’t matter because any decisions will be based on facts and what happens on the ground. President Donald Trump last week touted what he described as a  “very good talk” with a Taliban leader, and insisted the group wants to cease violence. Asked if he believes the Afghan government will be capable of defending itself by the time of a complete U.S. troop withdrawal, he said he didn’t know, but noted, “eventually, countries have to take care of themselves.” The Pentagon’s top spokesman, Jonathan Hoffman, also offered a bit more optimism on Tuesday, saying Defense Secretary Mark Esper believes the U.S.-Taliban deal is holding up, despite some instances of violence, some of which is being committed by the Islamic State group’s Afghanistan affiliate. “While levels are not as low as some would like them to be, we’ve seen progress and we hope that that continues to hold.” He said that while Esper would like to see the number of attacks drop to zero, that is not a requirement under the U.S.-Taliban agreement. Both McKenzie and Kathryn Wheelbarger, a top Pentagon policy adviser on international affairs, said America’s complete troop withdrawal is contingent on whether the level of violence is reduced and the Taliban adheres to its commitments. McKenzie said he would recommend against that full pullout if attacks continue and the Afghan forces can’t protect their own country without direct U.S. support. Wheelbarger called the full pullout “aspirational” and said Esper would reassess the matter if the Taliban doesn’t abide by the agreement. The United States has begun withdrawing troops from Afghanistan, taking a step forward on its peace deal with the Taliban. And Afghan President Ashraf Ghani promised on Monday to start releasing Taliban prisoners, but by Tuesday he had not issued a decree to free them. The U.S.-Taliban deal was touted as Washington’s effort to end 18 years of war in Afghanistan. The next crucial step was to be intra-Afghan talks in which all factions including the Taliban would negotiate a road map for their country’s future. That plan has been thrown into chaos because both Ghani and his main political rival, Abdullah Abdullah were each sworn in as president in separate ceremonies Monday. Abdallah and the elections complaints commission had charged fraud in last year’s vote. Ghani, however, said Tuesday that he’d start putting together a negotiating team, and he said he would announce a decree to free the prisoners. His comments on the prisoner release came after the U.S. and a number of foreign dignitaries appeared to back his claim to the presidency by sending their representatives to his inauguration. Esper last week said “the entire process will be conditions-based, and we will retain in Afghanistan the necessary capabilities to protect our service members and allies and support the Afghan security forces.” A key challenge will be whether al-Qaida is able to resurge in Afghanistan and present a threat once again to the U.S. McKenzie was asked what evidence the U.S. has that the Taliban have cut ties with al-Qaida. He said it’s pretty clear the Taliban are actively fighting the Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan, but added that he is “less optimistic” about al-Qaida. “That’s something they (the Taliban) are going to have to demonstrate that has not yet been demonstrated,” he added, referring to the Taliban showing that it has severed ties to the extremist group that planned the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks from Afghanistan. He said the U.S. will have “ample time to see if they actually do that” before the U.S. completes a troop withdrawal. He said the key threats to the U.S. continue to be the ability of al-Qaida and the Islamic State to generate attacks against the U.S. “The best intelligence estimates tell us that if we do not maintain pressure on those two entities, that in a period of time — and you can say a year, you can say two years, you can say somewhere in between — they’re going generate the ability to do external attacks again, and that will manifest itself here in the United States,” McKenzie said.",US commander paints grim picture of US-Taliban peace accord,2020-03-10T15:29:42Z,https://apnews.com/65afea984ebc631c899a59bd004cb25b,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — Members of the House and Senate are receiving classified briefings Tuesday on election security, the first since intelligence officials warned lawmakers of new Russian efforts to interfere in the 2020 election.  The briefings come amid voting in the 2020 presidential primaries and after intelligence officials told lawmakers last month that Russia is still trying to to sow discord in the American electorate.  Lawmakers were told in a classified briefing in February that Russia continues to have a preference for President Donald Trump, after also trying to help him in the 2016 presidential contest, according to officials familiar with the briefing.  Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is running in the Democratic primary to challenge Trump, acknowledged that he was also briefed by U.S. officials about Russian efforts to boost his candidacy. The Russian efforts are aimed at undermining public confidence in the integrity of U.S. elections and stirring general chaos in American politics, intelligence experts say. Intelligence officials from seven agencies — including the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice and multiple intelligence agencies — will brief the House and then the Senate Tuesday afternoon.  The Russian interference is expected to be a topic of questioning, along with efforts to secure state and local election systems that were scanned by Russia in 2016. There is no evidence that any votes were changed.  Shortly after the news reports of Russian interference in the 2020 contest last month, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tweeted: “We await the election security briefing for Members on March 10.”  One official who will not be briefing lawmakers is Richard Grenell, a Trump loyalist who is serving as acting national intelligence director. Grenell, criticized by Democrats as being unfit for the job, was originally on the list of officials being sent to Congress by the Trump administration but was later replaced by another official from the office of the Director of National intelligence, according to two people familiar with the schedule. The people requested anonymity to discuss the classified briefing, The office of the DNI later denied in a tweet that Grenell backed out of the briefing.  Trump has nominated Texas Rep. John Ratcliffe as a permanent replacement for Grenell, but it’s unclear if he will have the needed support in the Senate for confirmation. Trump also nominated Ratcliffe for the post last year, then withdrew the nomination after Democrats questioned his experience and news reports challenged the accuracy of Ratcliffe’s resume.  The president has long questioned whether Russia interfered in the 2016 elections and has called that theory a “hoax” despite the determination of the nation’s intelligence agencies that it happened. On Tuesday, he tweeted that “there is another Russia, Russia, Russia meeting today.”  Trump falsely said that the meeting would be headed by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, “so I wouldn’t expect too much!” Trump has often criticized Schiff, who is not leading the briefing, since he led the House’s impeachment investigation.  Schiff tweeted in response that Trump was wrong, and that the officials providing the briefing are agency heads and senior officials.  “They are your own people,” Schiff tweeted to Trump. “We will insist on the truth, whether you like it or not.” ",Congress set for classified briefings on securing elections ,2020-03-10T18:01:12Z,https://apnews.com/8d1baa5dc5a2d7a013b8aa2d1b4a33b9,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department must give Congress secret grand jury testimony from special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday, giving the House a significant win in a separation-of-powers clash with the Trump administration. The three-judge panel said in a 2-1 opinion that the House Judiciary Committee’s need for the material in its investigations of President Donald Trump outweighed the Justice Department’s interests in keeping the testimony secret. The opinion authorizes access to information that Democrats have sought since the conclusion of Mueller’s investigation, giving lawmakers previously-undisclosed details from the two-year Russia probe. Writing for the majority, Judge Judith Rogers said that because Mueller himself “stopped short” of reaching conclusions about Trump’s conduct to avoid stepping on the House’s impeachment power, the committee had established that it could not make a final determination about Trump’s conduct without access to the underlying grand jury material. “The Committee’s request for the grand jury materials in the Mueller Report is directly linked to its need to evaluate the conclusions reached and not reached by the Special Counsel,” wrote Rogers, a Clinton appointee. Judge Thomas Griffith issued a separate concurring opinion. Judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, dissented, suggesting that the need for the testimony could have waned after Trump’s acquittal at a Senate impeachment trial last month. “After all, the Committee sought these materials preliminary to an impeachment proceeding and the Senate impeachment trial has concluded. Why is this controversy not moot?” Rao wrote. It is unclear when the materials might actually be turned over. The Trump administration can ask the full appeals court to rehear the case, and can appeal to the Supreme Court. The ruling softens the blow of a loss the House endured two weeks ago when judges on the same court said they would not force former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify before Congress. The split decisions leave neither the administration nor Congress with a clear upper hand in an ongoing inter-branch dispute. The ruling is a major win for Democrats who have fought the Justice Department for nearly a year, but it’s unclear what the House will actually do with the material. Lawyers for the Democrats have said the grand jury material could potentially be used for additional articles of impeachment, though the Senate impeachment trial over the president’s interactions with Ukraine ended weeks ago in an acquittal. The case is one of several disputes between the Trump administration and Congress that courts have grappled with in recent months.  The two sides had been similarly at odds on the question of whether McGahn could be forced to testify about Trump’s behavior during the Russia investigation. The appeals court ruled in a recent 2-1 decision that judges had no role to play in that dispute and dismissed the case. Mueller issued a 448-page report last April that detailed multiple interactions between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia and that examined several episodes involving the president for potential obstruction of justice. Mueller said his team did not find sufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between the campaign and the Kremlin to tip the election, though pointedly noted that he could exonerate the president for obstruction. Portions of the report were blacked out, including grand jury testimony and material that Mueller said could harm ongoing investigations or infringe on the privacy of third parties. Grand jury testimony is typically treated as secret, in part to protect the privacy of people who are not charged or are considered peripheral to a criminal investigation. But several exceptions allow for the material to be turned over, including if it is in connection with a judicial proceeding.  The House argued that the impeachment inquiry met that definition, and it sought copies of testimony referenced in Mueller’s report. Chief U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell sided with the House last October in ordering that the material be turned over. The Justice Department appealed that decision, with lawyers arguing that the material sought by the House had no relevance to the impeachment inquiry and that the House already had ample information about the investigation. Several dozen witnesses appeared before Mueller’s grand jury, including former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. ___ Associated Press writer Mark Sherman in Washington contributed to this report. ___ Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP",Court: House entitled to Mueller probe grand jury testimony,2020-03-10T16:31:05Z,https://apnews.com/05068707d7c680a28bea89e3b7b697b5,AP
"MOSCOW (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump will not be coming to Moscow for Victory Day celebrations on May 9, the White House announced Tuesday in a disappointment for the Kremlin. The White House confirmed that Trump has declined the Kremlin invitation to attend Russia’s Victory Day celebrations on the 75th anniversary of World War II victory — the nation’s most important holiday.  Trump said last year he appreciated the invitation, but wasn’t sure if he could go as the celebration falls “right in the middle of political season.” “Via diplomatic channels, we have received information that the (U.S.) president will not be coming,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Tuesday, adding that it remains unclear who will represent the U.S. on the Victory Day in Moscow.  In an interview with the state-run Tass news agency, a part of which was released Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said it would be “a mistake” for world leaders not to attend the Victory Day celebrations this year.  “I think that, concerning former members of the anti‑Hitler alliance, the right thing to do would be to attend, from both a domestic political stance and a moral one,” Putin said. “We look forward to seeing them and we will be glad if they come. If not, well, that’s their choice. But I think that would be a mistake for them.” Since Soviet times, Victory Day has been the nation’s most revered holiday, reflecting enormous human losses and sacrifice in the war. Russian officials have put the nation’s World War II death toll at 27 million, and some historians believe it could be higher. The Red Square parade is set to involve 14,000 troops and 300 military vehicles in a massive show of Russian military might. White House officials and Trump allies feared that the trip to Moscow in an election year could be politically damaging. While they insisted that Trump has been tough on Russia, deploying new sanctions, they believed that a visit to the country by Trump — which would have been a first since he took office — could play into Democrats’ charges that the president has not been forceful enough in condemning Russian election interference and its invasion of Ukraine. For Putin, the Red Square parade offers a chance to have global leaders pay homage to Russia for its role in defeating the Nazis. Western leaders’ attendance of the celebrations would mark a major diplomatic coup for the Russian leader. Russia-West ties have plunged to post-Cold War lows after Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula and support for pro-Russia insurgents in eastern Ukraine. The U.S. and the European Union have slapped Russia with several rounds of sanctions that have limited its access to international financial markets and cut the flow of Western energy and defense technologies. Winning a respite from the penalties has been a top priority for the Kremlin. While a quick lifting of the sanctions appears unlikely, Western leaders’ presence at the Kremlin parade could provide momentum for mending ties. Putin already has scored a strong point when French President Emmanuel Macron agreed to attend the Moscow festivities. Since last year, Macron has spoken repeatedly about the need to re-engage Russia to prevent it from forming an alliance with China. In December, Macron hosted Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to discuss a peace settlement for eastern Ukraine. It wasn’t clear if Merkel would also attend the Victory Day celebrations. In a diplomatic ruse, she visited Moscow a day after the 2015 Victory Day, shunning the parade and laying flowers at the Unknown Soldier’s tomb. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson hasn’t said whether he plans to attend. Russia-British ties, which already had been frayed by the Ukrainian crisis, the war in Syria and other issues, plummeted further over the poisoning of a former Russian intelligence officer and his daughter in Salisbury, England, in March 2018. The Kremlin has staunchly denied any official connection to the attack.  ___ Daria Litvinova in Moscow, and Zeke Miller and Darlene Superville in Washington, contributed to this report.",White House confirms Trump not coming to Moscow for V-Day,2020-03-10T11:25:16Z,https://apnews.com/efadec98b12b2720ca83346279d8e565,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — Securities and Exchange Commission employees have been encouraged to work remotely for the foreseeable future after a coronavirus scare at the agency’s Washington headquarters.  The agency, which oversees the financial markets, said it was informed Monday afternoon that a headquarters employee had received medical treatment for respiratory symptoms earlier in the day. The unidentified employee was informed by a doctor that they may have been infected with the virus and was referred for testing, the SEC said.  The SEC is the first major federal agency to employ teleworking in an effort to contain the virus’ spread. Also on Tuesday, American University announced it would temporarily shift to all-online classes in order to limit a potential spread of the virus.  Washington, D.C., has so far identified five local cases of coronavirus infections. The first identified case is the rector of a prominent Episcopalian church in Georgetown, prompting Washington officials to call for hundreds of parishioners to self-quarantine for two weeks.  The SEC is a leading regulator of financial markets, which have suffered steep declines as the virus has spread around the world. The agency said the scattering of headquarters employees to work from their homes or other remote locations will not affect operations. Among other precautions, the agency “is encouraging headquarters employees to telework until further guidance,” it said.  “Even with increased telework, the SEC remains able and committed to fully executing its mission on behalf of investors, including monitoring market function and working closely with other regulators and market participants,” said the agency. American University is the first in the nation’s capital to make such a move, although other universities such as Harvard have done the same. “While the risk to our community remains low at this time, this could change quickly,” AU President Sylvia Burwell announced Tuesday in a letter to students.  Burwell, a former U.S. secretary of Health and Human Services, said the AU spring break—which started Monday and was scheduled to end on March 16 — would be extended through Wednesday March 18. Classes will resume in an online format on the 18th and continue that way through at least April 3.  The university dorms will remain open, but Burwell wrote, “We strongly encourage students to return to their homes” for the three weeks of online studies.",SEC asks DC workers to telecommute after employee is treated,2020-03-10T13:03:26Z,https://apnews.com/1b2e0c6942b404d7d10950e3c3956130,AP
"ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) — Melania Trump urged parents and teachers Tuesday to teach children how to interact in positive ways and also to prepare them for the negativity that comes with living in a digital age, calling them the “front line” against irresponsible behavior online.  The first lady focused on cyberbullying in remarks to the National PTA Legislative Conference and did not mention the coronavirus, an issue on the minds of educators and parents nationwide.  She also shared an extended handshake with PTA President Leslie Boggs at a time when federal health officials are discouraging people from engaging in such touching when they meet.  For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. But for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.  The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 58,000 have so far recovered. In her remarks, Mrs. Trump said the internet can be a “tool for good” by helping people share important life updates and stay informed but can be “destructive and dangerous,” even deadly, when misused. The first lady spoke about a 16-year-old Tennessee high school junior who took his life last September after discovering that his intimate messages with a boy had been put on social media by classmates. The teen had not been public about his sexuality. She said parents and teachers are the “front line” against such irresponsible online behavior. “As parents, adults, educators, and community leaders, it is our responsibility to ensure our children are being taught the importance of positive ways to interact with each other and prepare them for attacks and negativity they could receive in this new digital age,” she said. “With your help, we can break down the harmful barriers that internet abuse poses to our children and society,” she said, adding that she was “thrilled” to learn about steps by PTAs across the country to teach students, parents and teachers how to use technology responsibly. Cyberbullying is one aspect of a youth initiative named “Be Best” that Mrs. Trump launched in 2018 that also focuses on their overall well-being and combating opioid addiction. Her focus on cyberbullying comes as her husband, President Donald Trump, uses his Twitter account to belittle others and behave in ways that contradict her guidance to children. On Tuesday, the president tweeted that the independent Federal Reserve was “pathetic” for not cutting interest rates as low as he would like. Mrs. Trump has said in the past that her husband’s antics won’t deter her from helping children.  —- Follow Darlene Superville on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"DETROIT (AP) — The Latest on the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries (all times local): 2:20 p.m. Bernie Sanders is picking up the endorsement of a U.S. House member who backed Hillary Clinton in 2016 and praises the Vermont senator for leadership on issues affecting veterans and working families. Rep. Mark Takano of California says in a video out Tuesday from the Sanders campaign that he’s supporting him in part because of Sanders’ “ability to get things done.” Takano, who currently chairs the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, cites Sanders’ previous leadership on the Senate counterpart body. His backing is the first for Sanders from a member of Congress in several weeks, while former Vice President Joe Biden has rolled out nearly 50 congressional endorsements this month alone. Takano represents California, a delegate-rich prize that Sanders carried in last week’s Super Tuesday primaries. On Tuesday, six more states hold Democratic presidential primaries.  In the video, Takano — the first openly gay person of color elected to Congress — lauds Sanders’ early support for marriage equality, as well as his focus on issues including climate change and entitlement protections.  ___ 11:35 a.m. Joe Biden has faced down a pro-gun worker in a testy exchange over his plan to reinstate the assault weapons ban. Biden spoke at an auto plant in Detroit on Tuesday and then was confronted by a worker in a hard hat who accused him of “actively trying to end our Second Amendment right.” Biden used an expletive to tell the worker he was “full of” it and hushed an aide who was trying to end the conversation. Biden went on to say he supports the Second Amendment but added: “Do you need 100 rounds?” The worker pointed to a “viral video” in which he alleged Biden said he would take away people’s guns. Biden replied that he “did not say that” and that the video was “lying.” Biden otherwise received an overwhelmingly positive response from construction workers while courting the union vote in a final push as Michigan residents vote in the presidential primary. ___ This item has been corrected to show that Biden got a response from construction workers, not autoworkers. ___ 10:55 a.m. Joe Biden has received his third endorsement from a major national gun control group in as many days, this time from the Newtown Action Alliance. The group was founded after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, which killed 26 people, including 20 children. Biden also received the support of Everytown for Gun Safety and the Brady Campaign in recent days. Newtown Action Alliance chairwoman Po Murray said Tuesday in a statement Biden’s “support for gun violence prevention has never wavered.” The group notes the former vice president was appointed by President Barack Obama to lead a gun control task force after the 2012 Newtown massacre. The endorsement is another indication Bernie Sanders’ spotty record on gun control could weigh him down in the Democratic presidential primary. Michigan and five other states are voting Tuesday at a critical point in the race.  Sanders has a D-minus rating from the National Rifle Association. But the Vermont senator has been criticized by opponents and gun control advocates for past opposition to background check legislation and support for shielding gun manufacturers from lawsuits over misuse of their guns. ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.”",The Latest: Sanders nabs endorsement of 2016 Clinton backer,2020-03-10T14:59:29Z,https://apnews.com/1fb4ebe120cca2d5f93305f5425de023,AP
"ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — The 2020 census is off and running for much of America now. The U.S. Census Bureau made a soft launch of the 2020 census website on Monday, making its form available online. On Thursday, the Census Bureau will begin mailing out notices far and wide. For the bureau, the once-a-decade head count is akin to running a sprint and marathon at the same time. It takes awhile, but there’s plenty of action throughout. “It is that intense ... counting up to 330 million people in a very diverse, very mobile population, and over 140 million housing units,” Stephen Buckner, a senior Census Bureau executive, said during a recent visit to Miami. The bureau had an official in-person launch  in January in Toksook Bay, Alaska. Mail service is spotty and internet connectivity is unreliable in remote Alaska, making door-to-door canvassing the best way to gather responses. The Alaska villages get a head start over the rest of the nation because many residents scatter each spring to subsistence hunting and fishing grounds. There has been a U.S. census every decade since 1790. The results determine how many congressional seats each state gets and how $1.5 trillion in federal spending is distributed.  The 2020 census is the first in which most people are being encouraged to answer the questions online, though people can still answer the questionnaire by telephone or by mailing back a paper form if they prefer. The notices mailed out starting this week will include a census ID that matches addresses. People filling out the form via the internet are encouraged to use the ID, but those who answer the questions online before getting their IDs still will be counted. “The best user experience is provided with a Census ID,” the bureau said in a statement Monday evening. About 80% of households receiving mailings will get notices about how to answer the questions online, and about 20% of households automatically will receive a paper ballot if there are large numbers of seniors in their neighborhood or levels of internet connectivity are low. Census workers won’t begin going door-to-door in earnest until May, when they’ll approach homes that haven’t responded and ask the questions in person. Bureau officials are monitoring the spread of the novel coronavirus, which could disrupt the door-to-door phase. If there is a major disaster, such as an epidemic, census workers instead can drop off the questionnaires at homes, with the hope that people will respond on their own, according to the bureau’s operational plan. Testifying before a U.S. House appropriations subcommittee on Tuesday, U.S. Secretary Wilbur Ross, whose department oversees the Census Bureau, said the emphasis on getting people to respond online is minimizing physical contact that could spread the virus. “We will just have to play it by ear,” Ross said. “We are ready to make responses and we will deal with the situation as it evolves.” This week also poses the first true test of the Census Bureau’s new IT systems for capturing online responses. For the past three years, the Government Accountability Office has placed the census on its list of high-risk programs, mainly because it is relying on technology that has not been used before. Last month, the bureau decided to use a backup data-collection system  for handling the online responses after officials grew concerned that the primary system would not be able to handle excessive traffic.  The online approach to answering the 2020 census questions causes Democratic U.S. Rep. Karen Bass of California, to worry it will lead to an undercount of blacks and other minorities in hard-to-count communities.  “Having the census online can be a way of continuously undercounting the black population,” Bass said last week. Perhaps the most attention given the 2020 census over the past several years has been to the failed effort by the Trump administration to put a citizenship question on the form. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected those efforts, but some worry that lingering unease  may scare off some Hispanics and immigrants from participating. “It’s a challenge every 10 years to get any American to fill out the census. Some people feel you’re invading their privacy, as though its intrusive. Some people are fearful of giving the government more information,” said U.S. Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas. “But every 10 years, that challenge has been especially tough in minority communities, who sometimes are more disconnected from government than other communities.” At Tuesday’s hearing, several Democratic House members wanted to know why the Census Bureau hadn’t done more to denounce Republican National Committee mailings and a Trump re-election campaign ad on Facebook that the lawmakers said resembled a census form. Facebook last week took down the ads, saying it was enforcing its policies to prevent confusion over the 2020 census.  The lawmakers wanted to know if the Trump-appointed Ross had contacted the president’s re-election campaign or the RNC to ask them to stop, or if he had made a criminal referral to the Justice Department since it’s illegal for an organization to misrepresent a solicitation for donations as an official government mailing. Ross said he hadn’t made a referral, but added his department didn’t have the authority to do anything. “If we put out a statement every time there was something that was erroneous, we would be putting out probably hundreds of statements a day,” Ross said. ___ This story has been corrected to reflect that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross testified before a House subcommittee, not a Senate subcommittee. ___ Adriana Gomez Licon contributed to this report from Miami. ___ Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter at https://twitter.com/MikeSchneiderAP",Census Bureau site goes live as counting begins in earnest,2020-03-10T14:58:39Z,https://apnews.com/3fc59096ab138fdd4795386a2987c573,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — During the financial crisis a decade ago, President Barack Obama could look around the room and turn to an economist who served as Harvard’s president, a former president of the New York Federal Reserve and a renowned academic considered one of the world’s authorities on the Great Depression. As President Donald Trump confronts the public health and economic maelstrom caused by the coronavirus, his economic team has a much different background.  His top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, is a former financial analyst who was a commentator on CNBC. His treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, is a Goldman Sachs veteran and former Hollywood producer whose credits include the 2016 film “Rules Don’t Apply.” The threat from the pandemic has sent markets plummeting and created grave uncertainty about broader effects that could turn an economy Trump relentlessly showcases to one that leaves Americans struggling and puts the president’s central argument for reelection at risk.  The collapse in stock and oil prices has become the most important test of Trump’s economic leadership team. Unlike the impeachment process that ended with Trump’s acquittal last month, there is no partisan backstop that can halt infections or restore confidence to shuddering financial markets.  “We need an adult in the room to manage these issues,” said Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard economist and co-author of “This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly,” a global history of financial crises. “Obama had an extraordinary team and so did Bush. There were great men that rose to the occasion. The current Fed team in place is very strong, but they’re not central to response here. They can help at the margins.” Rogoff, who believes the chances of a global recession have risen dramatically with the health crisis, said he also worries about the Trump team’s ability to navigate the unpredictability of politically fraught negotiation. On one hand, he said that he worries that Trump could undercut Mnuchin, who is leading negotiations with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on an economic package to address the crisis. The economist said he’s also concerned that Democrats might be tempted to torpedo a deal to weaken Trump politically in the months before the November elections. Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said Trump arrived at the crisis with a short bench at the Treasury Department and has failed to appoint a permanent chairman to the White House Council of Economic Advisers, a key group of administration economists who advise the president on a range of economic policies. Tomas Philipson a University of Chicago economist and former George W. Bush administration official, has been serving as acting chairman for the council since June. “The things that we usually rely on in the middle of a crisis — usually a big group of talented bureaucrats -- we just don’t have there,” Swonk said. “Clearly the administration is further behind than I’d like, because it took until this week to talk about economic measures. They got ahead of themselves when they said they had a plan, when they didn’t.” For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.  The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 68,000 have so far recovered. Trump has moved more aggressively in recent days, meeting with leaders of banks, insurance companies and health care providers in an effort to calm market fears, so far with limited success. He addressed the nation Wednesday night and announced that he was sharply restricting travel from Europe for a month and that the government will defer certain tax payments for individuals and businesses for three months to lessen the pain of the virus outbreak. Now the administration must work with Congress over how to best address the crisis, with proposals ranging from a payroll tax holiday to large-scale fiscal stimulus. “There is no one on that team that has a real experience and understanding of fiscal stimulus,” said Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden during the Obama administration. He said he’s spoken to Kudlow about ideas to assist hourly workers impacted by the coronavirus outbreak. “That said they can mitigate that problem, because there are lots of people, lots of economists with those experiences. The question is: Will they reach out?” Mnuchin this week tried to assuage Americans who have watched their retirement savings sink by saying that this crisis is likely to have an end in sight, unlike the financial crisis. Kudlow has suggested that it may be a good time to buy stocks on the cheap.  Trump, who in late January boasted that U.S. officials had coronavirus “very well under control,” has called on Americans to “calm down” as he seeks to blunt the economic and health-related damage caused by the outbreak. “This is a one-time event,” Mnuchin said during Wednesday testimony before a House Appropriations subcommittee. “I couldn’t be more pleased that the U.S. economy is the most resilient in the world, and we will get through this very successfully.” Trump predicted “tremendous pent-up demand” will boost the economy once the crisis passes. But he also seemed to acknowledge that his version of a payroll tax cut faced long odds. Een as he called for major stimulus to stabilize the stock market and address concerns that the U.S. is headed toward a recession, Trump insisted in an Oval Office address to the nation that the economic pain will be temporary. “This is not a financial crisis,” he said. “This just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome together as a nation and as a world.” Paul Winfree, a former White House domestic policy adviser in the Trump administration, said the administration has plenty of firepower to deal with the crisis and that Trump has been well-served by his advisers. But Winfree said he’s concerned that the administration and Democrats are pushing for measures, such as the temporary payroll tax cut, that aren’t directly related to the coronavirus outbreak. “If I were the treasury secretary or leading the administration response to this, I’d be viewing this as we’re at the forefront of a demand-side shock ... that will have real economic consequences,” said Winfree, who is now an economic policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. “But let’s address the cause of the hemorrhage. And the cause of the hemorrhaging right now is the coronavirus.” Trump’s push for a payroll tax cut was met with a lack of enthusiasm even by many Republicans and White House aides, who were either unsure it was needed or weren’t convinced that it was the best way to address the crisis, according to administration officials who were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity. The president wants the yet-to-be-detailed tax cut to run through the end of the year, ensuring that workers would benefit from it through his reelection effort. Republicans say Trump’s chances at getting a deal ultimately come down to what Mnuchin can work out with Pelosi. The speaker, who spent time with Mnuchin on Tuesday and Wednesday, described her relationship with the treasury secretary as “professional.” For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.  The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 68,000 have so far recovered. ___ Associated Press writers Matthew Daly and Andrew Taylor contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — Washington is straining for an ample response to the coronavirus outbreak that is testing the nation’s political and health care systems after President Donald Trump restricted air travel from Europe, Congress ran into trouble approving an aid package and the centers of power — the domed Capitol and stately White House — are being shuttered to visitors. Trump, in an Oval Office address to the nation Wednesday night, said the monthlong restriction on travel would begin late Friday at midnight. After days of playing down the threat, he blamed Europe for not acting quickly enough to address the “foreign virus” and claimed that U.S. clusters were “seeded” by European travelers. The coronavirus question, for Trump and members of Congress, was becoming personal. The communications chief for Brazil’s president tested positive for the coronavirus, just days after meeting Trump and Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla. A photo of the president, the senator and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s communications chief, Fábio Wajngarten, shows the trio shoulder-to-shoulder at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort. It was the first time someone infected with the virus was known to have been in close proximity to the president.  Scott announced Thursday he was self-quarantining. Trump, 73, said he was unworried.  “We had dinner in Florida at Mar-a-Lago with the entire delegation. I don’t know if the press aide was there,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “But we did nothing very unusual. We sat next to each other for a period of time.” Asked whether he should be tested, Trump replied, “Let’s put it this way. I am not concerned.” The White House did not respond to repeated questions about the Bolsonaro news, including whether the president and his senior staff are being tested for the virus and whether any were considering self-quarantining. The president also said Thursday that he was considering major restrictions for others, such as limiting travel to domestic hot spots such as California and Washington state. “Is it a possibility?” he said in response to the question. “Yes.” Trump also claimed falsely Thursday that the U.S. is currently screening all Americans and foreigners who are entering the country, saying, “people coming in have to be tested.” And he claimed that those who return are being forced to isolate themselves, adding: “It’s going to be a pretty strong enforcement of quarantine.” No widespread quarantine orders have been announced. As classes, sports events, concerts and conferences are canceled across the nation, he said he would be halting his signature campaign rallies, telling reporters that he believes he needs a “little separation until such time as this goes away.” And he proposed postponing this summer’s Olympics in Japan for a year, too. So far, the administration’s haphazard response and the stalemate in Congress have resulted in more uncertainty as the crisis roils the financial markets and rewrites daily life for Americans. House lawmakers expressed alarm Thursday after a private briefing with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the National Institute of Health’s infectious disease chief, and other public health officials, Lawmakers were particularly frustrated that U.S. officials have tested relatively few patients suspected to be infected. “We’re basically, in my opinion, flying blind,” said Rep. Susie Lee, D-Nev. Others described the meeting as heated and testy, with many lawmakers leaving flooded with graver concerns about the administration’s response. “We should be exuding confidence nationally,” said Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif. “The confusion is damaging.” Congress decided to shut the Capitol to the public until April. Congressional office buildings and the Congressional Visitor Center, through which tourists enter the Capitol, were also being closed. Only lawmakers, staff, journalists and visitors with official business will be permitted to enter. White House tours have been suspended.  The Smithsonian said it was canceling all public events, programming and gatherings, including rental of its facilities, through May 3. The Smithsonian’s network of museums and the National Zoo will remain open for now. The financial markets around the world took more hits Thursday. The S&P 500 was down 7%, as of 10:15 a.m. after trading was temporarily halted following a steep drop in the first few minutes of trading. The index is set to join the Dow in entering a bear market after losing more than 20% from its record set last month, and one of the greatest eras in Wall Street’s history is crumbling. The Dow was off about 1,800 points, or close to 8%. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.  The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.  Trump said the U.S. travel restrictions won’t apply to Britain and there would be exemptions for “Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings.”  The State Department issued a global health advisory cautioning U.S. citizens to “reconsider travel abroad” due to the virus and associated quarantines and restrictions.  Congress’s multibillion-dollar aid package from Democrats was being halted by Republicans before a hoped-for vote Thursday. “Right now we have to find our common ground to work together to get this done as soon as possible,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Trump said he would not support the measure “because there are things in there that have nothing to do with what we’re talking about.” He did not go into detail. The bill would build on last week’s $8.3 billion emergency coronavirus measure and provide free testing, a new federal sick pay program, more unemployment insurance and food aid for workers and other Americans hit by the crisis. The package would create a federal sick pay program, providing up to three months of partial pay, for those stricken or caring for those ill from the virus. It would require health insurance companies to provide free testing for the virus and eliminate cost-sharing requirements such as co-payments for Medicare and Medicaid patients. There’s more than $1 billion in food aid for the poor and senior citizens, including money to replace school lunch benefits for children whose schools have closed. It has $1 billion in extra money for unemployment pay, for the newly jobless. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., called it “an ideological wish list” that Republicans would oppose. While Trump said all European travel except from Britain would be cut off, Homeland Security officials later clarified that the new travel restrictions would apply only to most foreign nationals who have been in the “Schengen Area” at any point in the 14 days prior to their scheduled arrival to the United States. The area includes France, Italy, German, Greece, Austria, Belgium and others, and the White House said the zone has the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases outside of mainland China.  The restrictions don’t apply to legal permanent residents, immediate family of U.S. citizens or others “identified in the proclamation” signed by Trump. Vice President Mike Pence said Thursday on ABC’s “Good Morning America” that the administration is also asking travelers returning to the U.S. from Europe to “voluntarily quarantine” for 14 days. But some health officials, and even a former high-ranking Trump administration official, suggested that Trump’s European travel restriction was futile because the virus is already widespread on U.S. soil. “In two weeks, we will regret wasting time and energy on travel restrictions and wish we focused more on hospital preparation and large scale community mitigation,” Trump’s former homeland security adviser, Thomas Bossert, tweeted Thursday. The Oval Office address represented an abrupt shift in tone from a president who has repeatedly played down the severity of the virus outbreak. Even as Trump spoke from behind the Resolute Desk, the pandemic’s ferocious rewriting of American daily life continued. The National Basketball Association suspended its season, and Oscar-winning actor Tom Hanks announced that he and his wife, Rita Wilson, had tested positive for COVID-19. The first confirmed case on Capitol Hill was reported in a legislative staffer. The White House has scrapped a planned trip by the president to Nevada and Colorado this week as a precaution. Trump’s reelection campaign also postponed an event next Thursday in Milwaukee that was to feature the president. Trump is considered at higher risk because of his age and has repeatedly flouted the advice of public health experts, who have advised the public to stop hand-shaking and practice social distancing. ___ Associated Press writers Aamer Madhani, Lauran Neergaard, Martin Crutsinger, Laurie Kellman and Kevin Freking in Washington contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — A senior Brazilian official who attended weekend events with President Donald Trump in Florida has tested positive for the coronavirus, marking the first time that someone known to have the virus was in close proximity to the president. Trump does not plan to be tested or go into self-quarantine, the White House said.  Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s communications director, Fábio Wajngarten, tested positive just days after traveling with Bolsonaro to a meeting with Trump and senior aides in Florida. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement Thursday that “exposures from the case are being assessed, which will dictate next steps.” “Both the President and Vice President had almost no interactions with the individual who tested positive and do not require being tested at this time,” Grisham said. Wajngarten joined Bolsonaro on a three-day trip to the U.S. and on Saturday was at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club, where he posted a photo of himself posing beside Trump. A video from the event also showed him standing directly behind both presidents as they addressed a crowd. Bolsonaro and Wajngarten later attended a birthday party for Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is dating the president’s son Donald Trump Jr.  The meeting also included Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump, son-in-law Jared Kushner, Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, Brazil’s foreign minister Ernesto Araujo and Bolsonaro’s son Eduardo, who is a federal lawmaker, among others. Vice President Mike Pence went to Mar-a-Lago that evening. “We had dinner in Florida at Mar-a-Lago with the entire delegation,” Trump told reporters on Thursday in the Oval Office. “I don’t know if the press aide was there. But we did nothing very unusual.” For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.  The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 127,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 68,000 have so far recovered. Wajngarten initially denied a report on Wednesday that he had been tested for the virus, saying on his social media account that his health was fine. He is now in self-quarantine at home, according to the statement.  A statement from Bolsonaro’s communications office on Thursday said that Wajngarten’s test results have come back positive and that the presidency is adopting preventive measures to ensure Bolsonaro’s health.  The government also communicated with U.S. authorities so they can take cautionary measures, the Brazilian statement said.  Two major newspapers reported Thursday that Bolsonaro has been tested for coronavirus, with results expected Friday, though Brazil’s presidential press office didn’t confirm when contacted by The Associated Press. Bolsonaro’s son confirmed his father has been tested in a Thursday tweet and said he isn’t showing symptoms. Bolsonaro’s health has been a focus since a 2018 stabbing on the campaign trail. Since the assassination attempt, he has already undergone four surgeries with a fifth upcoming. In December, he was taken to the hospital after slipping in the bathroom of the presidential residence and banging his head. Grisham said that under U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, “there is currently no indication to test patients without symptoms, and only people with prolonged close exposure to confirmed positive cases should self-quarantine.” Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, who met Bolsonaro in Miami, and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham who was at Mar a Lago on Saturday said they will self-quarantine. ___ Biller reported from Rio de Janeiro.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Democratic National Committee is moving Sunday’s presidential debate from Arizona to Washington because of concerns about the coronavirus.  The party had already announced that the debate between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders would be held without a live audience. Now the location is changing over concerns about cross-country travel.  In addition, Univision anchor Jorge Ramos no longer will moderate the debate because he was in proximity to a person who was in direct contact with another individual who tested positive for the virus. The DNC says Ramos is not symptomatic.  The debate will be the first one-on-one contest between Biden and Sanders.  The coronavirus has already disrupted other aspects of the presidential campaign, with the Democratic contenders and President Donald Trump canceling rallies on the advice of public health officials who have cautioned against people attending large events.

"WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Thursday called for a sweeping national response to the coronavirus outbreak, chiding President Donald Trump for a response he said was woefully insufficient and warning that the widening public health crisis should not be viewed through a lens of politics.  “This administration has left us woefully unprepared for the exact crisis we now face,” Biden said in a speech delivered from his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and tailored to draw sharp contrasts between the former vice president and the Republican incumbent he hopes to topple this fall.  A short time later, Biden’s last Democratic presidential rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, said the outbreak may isolate Americans working from home and in quarantine and he suggested the country needed to band together, not divide.  “If there ever was a time in the modern history of our country when we were all in this together this is the moment,” Sanders said. He said of Trump’s White House, “We have an administration that is largely incompetent and whose incompetence and recklessness have threatened the lives of many, many people in this country.” Biden said he is already up to meeting such challenges better than Trump.  “No president can promise to prevent future outbreaks, but I can promise you this, when I’m president we will be better prepared, respond better and recover better,” Biden declared. “We will lead with science, listen to the experts, will heed their advice. We’ll build American leadership and rebuild it to rally the world to meet the global threats that we are likely to face again.”  Biden cautioned that the virus, which some Trump allies have dismissed as overblown fodder for the president’s critics, “does not have a political affiliation.” And in a direct dig at Trump, Biden added another pledge: “I’ll always tell you the truth. This is the responsibility of a president. That’s what is owed the American people.”  The former vice president and Sanders gave their dueling addresses on the coronavirus less than 24 hours after Trump spoke to the nation from the Oval Office about a public health crisis he’d previously downplayed.  Sanders called on Trump to declare a national emergency and said a hotline should be established for people seeking information about coronavirus. He also said the U.S. was at a “major disadvantage” compared with other countries since many people have no medical insurance.  Sanders has advocated for fully government-financed health care under a “Medicare for All” system that is the centerpiece of his campaign. But he said Thursday that in the meantime during the outbreak, the government must ensure that, “Everyone must be able to get all of the health care that they need without cost.” He added that if a vaccine to the virus is developed, it should be free.  “We need an emergency response to the emergency,” Sanders said, “and we need it immediately.” With his speech, Biden unveiled a slate of policy proposals and said Trump is “welcome to adopt all of it today.” Biden called for all medically necessary testing for the virus to be accessible and without cost. He called for Congress to enact paid leave for all Americans, both as a temporary fix in responding to the current health crisis and a long-term solution to what he describes as a key gap in U.S. labor practices. Biden also proposed mobilizing federal resources to ensure at least 10 testing sites in every state and providing federal aid, including from the Pentagon, to put a stand-up hospital in any American city where an outbreak exceeds the capacity of existing health care infrastructure. Biden pledged that his administration would hold daily briefings in any such crisis, with top public health professionals in front of cameras to address the nation directly. Aides said Biden’s aim, besides addressing the current situation, was to give voters a practical example of one of his core arguments: that he’d be ready on Inauguration Day to handle whatever trials reach the Oval Office. In some ways, the dynamics recall the financial crisis that mushroomed late in the summer of 2008. The meltdown further damaged outgoing President George W. Bush and his Republican Party, dealing GOP nominee John McCain a new setback and granting a wider opening for Democratic nominee Barack Obama and his running mate, Biden. But that unfolded weeks before the election — Biden must keep making his case for nearly eight months. Biden now leads Sanders by more than 150 delegates after winning four more state primaries Tuesday, with Washington state still being counted. And his advantage could expand considerably next Tuesday when the delegate-rich states of Florida, Illinois and Ohio hold primaries. Biden and Sanders have both canceled public events ahead of next Tuesday’s primaries, yielding to public health officers and elected officials who are discouraging large campaign rallies. The pair will meet in a debate Sunday night on CNN, without a live audience.  For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.  Sanders is 78. Biden is 77.  The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. Regardless of how Biden handles the moment, the coronavirus outbreak comes at a political juncture for him. He’s solidified his position as the prohibitive favorite for his party’s nomination, but Sanders has made clear he’s not ready to abandon his campaign, and many of the senator’s supporters on the progressive left aren’t enthusiastic about embracing Biden as the Democratic standard-bearer. That slice of the Democratic coalition likely isn’t enough to derail Biden’s nomination, but it could complicate his efforts in a general election campaign, just as it did for Hillary Clinton in 2016 after she defeated Sanders but lost to Trump in November. Projecting leadership on a grave public health matter could be a boon with the middle of the electorate, especially independents and moderate Republicans wary of Trump. But it won’t necessarily corral Sanders supporters who also will play key roles in deciding battleground-state outcomes in November. For his part, Trump said Thursday he’s “very happy to run against” Biden. “One of the reasons I ran for president was because of Joe and the job they did,” Trump said, referring to Biden’s time as Obama’s vice president. “It’s maybe the way it should be.”  ___ Barrow reported from Atlanta.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and Ireland’s Prime Minister Leo Varadkar found themselves in an awkward moment: How do you a greet a fellow world leader in the midst of a global viral pandemic? The two made the mutual decision upon Varadkar’s arrival Thursday for the Irish leader’s annual visit to the White House not to shake hands. “We looked at each other and said, ‘What are we going to do?’” said Trump, acknowledging to reporters that he felt a bit odd welcoming the Irish leader without a handshake. “You know, it’s sort of a weird feeling.” Trump, a self-described germaphobe, acknowledges that he came to accept handshakes as part of the territory that comes with being the world’s most powerful leader.  He joked during Thursday’s Oval Office meeting that India and Japan -- both nations he has visited as president -- are “ahead of the curve” because their cultures generally don’t involve handshakes. Trump even did a quick demonstration from his seat of the Japanese ojigi and the Indian namaste, both of which involve slight bows. Varadkar, whose father was born in India, demonstrated that he and the president opted for something similar to the Indian greeting, putting their hands together in prayer and slightly bowing. “It almost feels impersonal. It feels like you’re being rude,” Varadkar said of forgoing the handshake. “But we just can’t afford to think like that for the next few weeks.” Even as he avoided shaking hands with Varadkar, the president continued to play down concerns that he may have already been exposed to individuals infected by the coronavirus.  The Brazilian government confirmed that President Jair Bolsonaro’s communications director tested positive for coronavirus, just days after traveling with Bolsonaro to a meeting with Trump in Florida. “Let’s put it this way,” Trump said. “I am not concerned.” Varadkar was later the guest of honor at the annual Friends of Ireland lunch at the Capitol. Trump did not attend the lunch. It’s a Capitol Hill event that the sitting president typically attends each year to honor the United States’ special relationship with Ireland.  The president didn’t skip the lunch out of abundance of caution, although public health officials are recommending that older Americans try to avoid large gatherings to limit exposure to the virus.  The president just didn’t want to be in the same room as his political enemy and lunch host, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The White House over the weekend said Trump chose not to participate in events where Pelosi “so often chooses to drive discord and disunity.” Pelosi, meanwhile, welcomed Varadkar for an elegant meal of apple and watercress salad, beef short ribs and chocolate mousse. The speaker and the prime minister shared an elbow bump.  ___ Associated Press writer Laurie Kellman contributed reporting.",Awkward moment: Trump and Irish PM skip the handshake,2020-03-12T19:15:35Z,https://apnews.com/cca929a1a0a0a39e6bade9a61cd27fc7,AP
"Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden is shaking up his campaign leadership by naming a veteran of Barack Obama’s and Hillary Clinton’s White House bids as his campaign manager. The campaign announced Thursday that Jen O’Malley Dillon will serve as campaign manager going forward. She has already helped Biden resurrect his campaign, being brought in to focus on Nevada after dismal finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire put the former vice president’s third White House bid on the brink of collapse. Biden finished a distant second to Bernie Sanders in Nevada, but it was enough to set the stage for his surge from South Carolina onward.  O’Malley Dillon, 43, nominally succeeds Greg Schultz, who has served as campaign manager since Biden announced his bid last April. But Schultz already was practically superseded after Iowa, when Biden elevated adviser Anita Dunn by giving her final decision-making authority. It’s not immediately clear whether Dunn will retain senior status over O’Malley Dillon. Schultz, meanwhile, has continued to serve Biden with a wide-ranging portfolio, including as a primary contact for top donors and elected officials around the country. O’Malley Dillon’s promotion was first reported by The Washington Post. The move comes as Biden looks ahead to a potential general election matchup with President Donald Trump. But it serves as a reminder that Biden’s campaign, even with his rapid ascent to national delegate leader and prohibitive favorite for the nomination, spent months beset by poor fundraising, insufficient organization and quiet but widespread frustrations from Democratic Party donors and power players. O’Malley Dillon has a long resume in Democratic politics. She was a deputy campaign manager for Obama’s reelection campaign in 2012. She was a top official in Clinton’s 2016 campaign and later was Clinton’s choice as co-chair of the Democratic Party’s special commission that overhauled the 2020 nominating process. She managed Beto O’Rourke’s 2020 presidential campaign.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress is shutting the Capitol to the public until April in reaction to the spread of the coronavirus, officials announced Thursday, a rare step that underscores the growing gravity with which the government is reacting to the viral outbreak. In a statement, the House and Senate sergeants at arms said congressional office buildings and the Congressional Visitor Center, through which tourists enter the Capitol, were also being shuttered.  In an email to lawmakers’ offices, the sergeants at arms said the Capitol will be closed to all tours, including special ones led by House and Senate members and their aides. No tours will be permitted in the Capitol Visitor Center, a massive three-level underground structure, which opened in 2008 and had greeted more than 21 million visitors through 2018.  Lawmakers’ offices will be required to meet any official visitors at building entrances, and they were asked to escort them out after the meetings.  Only lawmakers, staff, journalists and visitors with official business will be permitted to enter the buildings. The closures begin at 5 p.m. EDT Thursday, and the buildings are scheduled to reopen on April 1.  The officials said they were acting on the advice of District of Columbia health officials and of Congress’ own doctors. “We are taking this temporary action out of concern for the health and safety of congressional employees as well as the public,” they wrote. “We appreciate the understanding of those with planned visits interrupted by this necessary but prudent decision.”  Congress is scheduled to be on recess next week.  President Donald Trump’s administration and Congress have struggled over how to react to the virus and COVID-19, the disease it can cause that in some cases can be deadly. Congressional leaders have had to balance conflicting desires of protecting lawmakers and staffs from getting sick with keeping one of the country’s most visible public buildings open. At the White House, tours have been temporarily suspended.  While comprehensive records about past closures of the Capitol weren’t immediately available, the building is seldom closed completely to the public. No visitors were allowed immediately after a 1915 bomb threat against the building. And restrictions were placed on access to the visitors’ galleries overlooking the House and the Senate in 1954 after Puerto Rican nationalists fired from the House gallery on lawmakers, wounding five of them.  In the fall of 1918, the Capitol was closed briefly to visitors as the Spanish flu spread around the world, killing an estimated tens of millions of people. Around 1,000 people died in the Washington, D.C., region along with at least three members of the House, according to the chamber’s historians’ office.  After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks of 2001, the Capitol was closed to tours until December. Legislators’ staffs returned to work on Sept. 12. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 62,000 have recovered. ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"NEW YORK (AP) — The escalating coronavirus crisis is presenting President Donald Trump with a challenge for which he appears ill-equipped, his favorite political tactics ineffective and his reelection chances in jeopardy. A rare crisis battering the White House that is not of the president’s own making, the spreading coronavirus has panicked global financial markets and alarmed Americans, many of whom have turned to the Oval Office for guidance and reassurances. But what they have found is a president struggling for a solution, unable to settle Wall Street and proving particularly vulnerable to a threat that is out of his control. In an address to the nation Wednesday night, Trump announced a sweeping travel ban for much of Europe as well as a package of proposals to help steady the teetering economy. But he continued to play down the severity of the situation, painting it as a foreign threat that soon will be banished rather than focusing on managing the growing number of cases at home. “This is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history,” Trump declared.  Addressing the economic costs, he added, “This is not a financial crisis, this is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome together as a nation and as a world.”  But the virus has appeared impervious to the Republican president’s bluster. The virus does not have a Twitter account and, unlike so many previous Trump foes, is resistant to political bullying or Republican Party solidarity. It has preyed on his lack of curiosity and fears of germs while exposing divides and inadequacies within senior levels of his administration. It has taken away Trump’s favorite political tool, his rallies, from which he draws energy and coveted voter information.  And eight months from Election Day, it has endangered his best reelection argument — a strong economy — just as Joe Biden, the candidate emerging from the Democratic field, seems poised to take advantage of a political landscape upended by the virus. “Crises of varying degrees produce fascinating and often consequential elections: Think 1860, 1932, 1968, 2008. Such races turn on questions of chaos versus order and favor the candidate who seems to offer the best chance of bringing order to the country in times of uncertainty,” presidential historian Jon Meacham said. “What’s interesting about those examples is that incumbents, or candidates of the incumbent party, lost all of them.”  One of Trump’s most potent political assets is his ability to read a room, or a moment, often eschewing long-term planning for instantaneous reaction. But he was slow to come to grips with the threat posed by the coronavirus as it exploded in China, distracted by impeachment and unwilling to scare the markets by stirring panic or upsetting his trading partner in Beijing, Xi Jinping.  The virus first spooked Trump while he was in India two weeks ago, as a 1,000-point drop on Wall Street caused him to pepper aides with questions about the markets even as he was feted in New Delhi. But after he returned to the states, Trump continued to play down the virus, lashing into officials, including Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, for talking up the possible severity of the threat. He urged other aides, including Kellyanne Conway and senior economic adviser Larry Kudlow, to go on television and preach confidence, according to five White House officials and Republicans close to the White House. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private conversations. And as he has so often done before, Trump believed that through his force of will and ability to dominate a news cycle, he could alleviate the crisis, taking to Twitter and the White House briefing room podium to dismiss the threat. “The markets are going to be just fine,” Trump claimed Thursday, as he welcomed Ireland’s prime minister to the White House the morning after his Oval Office address. But Wall Street, unlike traditional political foes, has not listened. The markets opened down again Thursday morning, plummeting so quickly that automatic safeguards were triggered to temporarily halt trading. And while Trump deemed the media coverage of the virus “a hoax” meant to create hysteria and tank his poll numbers, it is a harder sell to ask his supporters to dismiss media reports when they see people in their own communities getting sick, schools closing and local drugstores unable to keep hand sanitizer on the shelves. Infighting erupted within the administration, as Trump blamed and then sidelined Azar, relegating the health secretary to a secondary role behind Vice President Mike Pence on the coronavirus task force. But while Trump empowered Pence and respected medical professionals to take the lead on briefings, he ignored his advisers’ advice to let the vice president be the public face of the administration’s response, according to the officials. Unable to cede the spotlight, Trump spoke extemporaneously to reporters at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta on Friday, requiring the vice president, who addressed the media in Washington moments later, to correct the president’s misstatements about the availability of testing kits and the fate of a cruise ship filled with coronavirus patients. It was only on Monday, as he was flying from Florida back to Washington, that the economic severity of the crisis hit home for Trump, according to three of the officials and advisers.  In one cabin on Air Force One, Matt Gaetz, a Florida GOP congressman who had accompanied Trump to a series of Orlando fundraisers, had isolated himself after learning he’d come into contact with someone infected by the virus. And on the TV in Trump’s aircraft office, Fox News was broadcasting dire graphics illustrating the single worst day for stock markets since the 2008 financial crisis.  By the time the plane touched down at Joint Base Andrews, Trump told aides he would change tactics and propose a broad economic stimulus to reassure investors. But the fate of his plan, which included a suspension of the payroll tax, remained unclear as the week went on and the markets’ roller coaster ride continued. “I think that in many ways this has made Trump a wartime president,” said former campaign communications director Jason Miller. “This virus has no borders, doesn’t discern between allies and foes and attacked the nation’s health security and economic security. It is going to take continued bold action from the president.” After surviving impeachment, Trump has in earnest remade his White House staff to focus on reelection, prioritizing loyalty over experience. Increasingly focused on his campaign, Trump pushed aides to continue scheduling massive rallies, even as his Democratic foes had begun canceling theirs. But late Wednesday, the White House announced that a trip to Colorado and Nevada had been cancelled. At least for now, no rallies were scheduled as a means to blunt the momentum of his likely general election foe, Biden, who offers himself as someone uniquely positioned to respond to the coronavirus. As vice president, Biden helped manage the Ebola outbreak and has long shown an ability to comfort rattled voters. Moreover, the Trump campaign believes that scuttling normal political activity benefits Biden, who tends to draw small rally crowds and has had some eyebrow-raising moments when interacting with voters. “This is something that doesn’t hurt and probably actually helps Joe Biden,” said Eric Trump, the president’s son and frequent campaign surrogate. “This works for him on all fronts.” Biden, now in command of the Democratic race after a series of primary wins Tuesday, has drawn a clear comparison between how he would handle the crisis and the president’s scattershot approach from the Oval Office. “At this moment, when there’s so much fear in the country and so much fear across the world, we need American leadership,” Biden said. “We need presidential leadership that’s honest, trusted, truthful and steady, reassuring leadership.” ___ EDITOR”S NOTE — Lemire has covered politics and the White House for The Associated Press since 2013. ___ Follow Lemire on Twitter at https://twitter.com/@JonLemire. ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.”","Analysis: Facing virus outbreak, Trump's tactics fall short",2020-03-12T02:31:43Z,https://apnews.com/3441fea7832f3c4a1e45efa87fa2f29e,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — House Democrats have unveiled an ambitious measure to provide free testing for the coronavirus, paid sick leave and strengthened unemployment insurance as a response to the worsening outbreak’s economic impact on people across the United States.  For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. But for some, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. The House legislation related to the virus is slated for a vote in the Democratic-controlled House on Thursday. The legislation includes: FREE CORONAVIRUS TESTING It requires private health insurance plans to provide free coronavirus testing and waives cost-sharing rules for testing provided to people covered by Medicare, Medicaid and federal retirement programs. It boosts federal matching funds to state Medicaid programs by 8%. PAID SICK LEAVE It establishes an unprecedented — but temporary — federal sick leave benefit paid through the Social Security program. Workers with the coronavirus or caring for family members with it would receive two-thirds of their wages for up to three months. The benefit would expire in January 2021. It also creates a federally mandated sick leave benefit for private businesses that would require all employers to allow their workers to accrue seven days of paid sick leave, with an additional 14 days available immediately in the event of public health emergencies such as the current coronavirus crisis. FOOD AID It provides $1.3 billion in emergency food aid for low-income pregnant women and their young children, senior citizens and food banks. It allows states to provide food stamps to make up for lost school lunch benefits if their children are kept home from school and directs $100 million of the funds to U.S. territories. UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS Workers laid off because of the coronavirus outbreak are already eligible for unemployment benefits, but the legislation provides $1 billion for additional caseloads and administrative costs to encourage temporarily furloughed workers to obtain unemployment benefits. ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. defense leaders on Thursday threatened a retaliatory strike against Iranian-backed Shia militia in Iraq, saying they know who launched the rockets in Iraq that killed and wounded U.S. and coalition troops and the attackers will be held accountable. Defense Secretary Mark Esper told reporters at the Pentagon that President Donald Trump on Wednesday night gave him the authority to do what he needs to do. The rapidly unfolding events signaled a renewed spike in tensions with Tehran and its proxy groups in Iraq, just two months after Iran carried out a massive ballistic missile attack against American troops at a base in Iraq. “We’re going to take this one step at a time, but we’ve got to hold the perpetrators accountable,” Esper said. “You don’t get to shoot at our bases and kill and wound Americans and get away with it.” At the White House, Trump said the attackers were a rebel group that “mostly likely looked like it could be backed by Iran. And we’ll see what the response is.” And Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Pentagon reporters the U.S. knows ”with a high degree of certainty” who launched the attack. Esper and Milley declined to provide any more information about any impending U.S. retaliation for the attack at Camp Taji north of Baghdad. But Esper said all options are on the table. On Capitol Hill, Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, the top U.S. commander for the Middle East, told senators that the deaths of U.S. and coalition troops is a “red line” for the U.S., but said he doesn’t think Iran has “a good understanding of where our red line is.” Asked if any counterattack could include a strike inside Iran, Esper said, “We are focused on the group that we believe perpetrated this in Iraq.” Two U.S. troops and one British service member were killed and 14 other personnel were wounded when 18 rockets hit the base on Wednesday. The U.S. military said the 107 mm Katyusha rockets were fired from a truck launcher that was found by Iraqi security forces near the base after the attack. U.S. officials have not publicly said what group they believe launched the rocket attack, but Kataib Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Shia militia group, is likely.  Kataib Hezbollah was responsible for a late December rocket attack on a military base in Kirkuk that killed a U.S. contractor, prompting American military strikes in response.  That in turn led to protests at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. They were followed Jan. 3 by a U.S. airstrike that killed Iran’s most powerful military officer, Gen. Qassem Soleimani, and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a leader of the Iran-backed militias in Iraq, of which Kataib Hezbollah is a member. In response to the Soleimani killing, Iran launched a massive ballistic missile attack on Jan. 8, at al-Asad air base in Iraq, that resulted in traumatic brain injuries to more than 100 American troops. McKenzie told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday morning that the killing of Soleimani and the increase in U.S. troops and assets in the region has made clear to Iran that the U.S. will defend its interests there. He said the U.S. has re-established a level of deterrence for state-on-state attacks by Iran. But, he said, “What has not been changed is their continuing desire to operate through their proxies indirectly again us. That is a far more difficult area to deter.” On Thursday, Esper and Milley said they spoke with their British counterparts about the attack, but declined to provide details.  Asked why none of the rockets was intercepted, Milley said there are no systems on the base capable of defending against that type of attack. He also said the 14 injured personnel were a mix of U.S. and allied troops as well as contractors, and that they will also be monitored for possible traumatic brain injury in the wake of the blasts.",Pentagon threatening retaliatory strike after attack in Iraq,2020-03-12T16:11:21Z,https://apnews.com/5ff9d48d1bdb2d2b1e4243d18930b159,AP
"CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago mom Rya Smith has no doubts about backing the top prosecutor in the nation’s second-biggest county for another term, even while acknowledging the office fumbled a criminal case against “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett.  Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx’s involvement in the Smollett case has dominated much of the attention in her reelection campaign, but Smith contends the focus instead should be on her record exonerating the innocent, tossing minor marijuana convictions and as the first black woman in the job.  “She’s done a great many things, especially for minorities,” Smith said. “The Jussie Smollett case was a pebble in the giant boulder of her career. That shouldn’t discredit her for one little mistake. She isn’t getting a fair shake.” Foxx is counting on more voters like Smith as she seeks a second term against three Democratic primary challengers who’ve seized on the Smollett case and a fractured relationship with police. In what’s likely the most expensive race of its kind, they’ve called it a bungled prosecution that benefited a politically-connected person and undermined public trust.  The controversial decision to dismiss charges against Smollett, who’s accused of fabricating a racist, anti-gay attack, has haunted Foxx, something that’s increasingly frustrated her. She declined an Associated Press interview but recently called the Smollett focus, “B.S.”  Defeating Foxx will be tough with her establishment backing, union support and super PACs targeting her opponents. But challengers — including Navy veteran Bill Conway, whose first run for office is being fueled by his billionaire father — believe they’ve found an opening for Tuesday.  “She just kept not telling the truth to the public,” said Conway, 41, a former assistant state’s attorney. He’s aired television ads since November, with far more money combined than all candidates — including two Republicans. About $10.5 million of the roughly $11.5 million he’s raised, comes from William Conway, co-founder of Carlyle Group, a Washington D.C.-based investment firm. Foxx, 47, has raised nearly $3.5 million.  Foxx acknowledged missteps. She recused herself from the Smollett case, but questions linger about whether she acted improperly for speaking to a Smollett relative and aide to former first lady Michelle Obama before the charges were dismissed. A special p rosecutor reinstated the charges last month, which Foxx blasted as political.  “That we are continuing to talk about this in a city that continues to deal with gun violence, in a city that is continuing to reckon with police accountability,” Foxx told the Chicago Sun-Times. “That somehow this case has been elevated to one of the greatest criminal injustices in our time feels disingenuous.”  There’s wide agreement she’s made reforms.  Foxx’s office was the first to dismiss low-level marijuana convictions as part of Illinois’ law legalizing recreational marijuana. She personally handed over roughly 1,000 petitions to a judge.  She ramped up a Conviction Integrity Unit with prosecutors vacating convictions of roughly 100 people linked to a former Chicago police sergeant’s scheme to shake down poor and black public housing residents.  Josh Tepfer of the Exoneration Project at the University of Chicago Law School called Foxx’s office “the most transparent” he’s worked with, noting she apologized to victims even though they were convicted before her tenure.  “She speaks to the unfair treatment of people of color in ways that are very unique,” he said.  That resonates with Tanya Watkins, who runs Soul in Action, a PAC that focuses on black candidates. Nearly one-quarter of Cook County’s 5.1 million residents are black.  Watkins believes Foxx hasn’t received fair treatment because of race. The other candidates are white.  “She has no margin for error,” Watkins said. “The things I’ve heard said about this black woman have reminded me how much more difficult it is to be a black woman in the public arena.”  Defense attorneys note the easing up on charges for lower-level crimes and alternative punishments. Some also praise her cash bail reforms. Her office has allowed the release of detainees held on nonviolent charges who can’t afford bonds up to $1,000. But others aren’t so complimentary.  Foxx has a rocky relationship with police, who dislike her reforms, including for nonviolent crimes like shoplifting. Things worsened when the Smollett charges were dropped. The tensions hit a peak in April with dueling protests outside her office involving the police union.  “There’s this attitude among law enforcement that this is a ‘catch and release’ system,” said Kulmeet Galhotra, who’s retired as the head of the Cook County Public Defender’s Homicide Task Force.  The sentiment is echoed by challenger former Chicago Alderman Bob Fioretti, 67. He and former federal prosecutor Donna More, 62, who’s also running, say the office needs to be more independent.  Some defense attorneys are also critical of her office for inconsistencies, saying the policies aren’t applied evenly.  Still, the Smollett case does resonate with some.  Chicagoan Demetrius Williams, 35, voted for Foxx before but thinks Smollett got off easy and will support Conway.  “I believe he has enough money to take on Kim Foxx,” said Williams, 35. “I’m not going to say that I’m so Conway crazy. I’ll take a chance. In four years, I can vote him out, too.”  __ Follow Sophia Tareen on Twitter: https://twitter.com/sophiatareen.",Foxx touts record as Smollett case engulfs Illinois primary,2020-03-12T17:33:33Z,https://apnews.com/0b050ed6adabfe8a1e25138f92f57231,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — Bernie Sanders pledged to harness the energy from his first campaign to turn out more voters in 2020. He would build a coalition of black, young and working-class voters who were energized by his transformative vision for America to build a broad coalition that would make him an unstoppable force against Democratic rivals and President Donald Trump. He was wrong. Virtually every expectation that the Vermont senator carried into his second White House bid has been overturned by Joe Biden’s dramatic comeback. The former vice president has emerged as the candidate preferred by African Americans from South Carolina to Mississippi and Michigan. Biden has also won voters without college degrees and made striking inroads in the suburbs that could be critical to control of the White House in November.  “Last night, obviously, was not a good night for our campaign, from a delegate point of view,” Sanders said Wednesday in his first public comments since he lost Michigan, the state that solidified his insurgent campaign four years ago. Sanders isn’t going anywhere immediately. He will be in Arizona on Sunday for a one-on-one debate against Biden. Arizona, which votes next Tuesday, is one of the few remaining bright spots on the primary calendar for Sanders. Having demonstrated new strength with Latinos this year, he hopes similar support in Arizona could at least momentarily blunt Biden. But the hurdles are getting higher. Sanders needs to win 57% of the remaining delegates to wrest the nomination from Biden. Both the rules for allocating delegates and voting history suggest that will be difficult.  Sanders’ challenge is demonstrated in part by his support among young voters. In Michigan, the largest of six states that voted last Tuesday, about 70% of voters under 30 backed Sanders. But they accounted for only 14% of voters, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of the state’s electorate. Veteran Democratic strategist James Carville criticized Sanders’ flawed belief that he could fundamentally change the electorate by relying on the young. “There was no chance,” Carville said. “Any political scientist with an IQ above room temperature could have told you that.” If one of Sanders’ strongest constituencies doesn’t turn out in large numbers, it may do him little good. However long Sanders remains in the race, Biden’s resurgence laid bare that, at his core, the senator is in some ways more of a cause than a candidate. And movement politics rarely lead to winning national elections. Sanders’ team also appears to have underappreciated the shift in the nation’s suburbs away from Trump and toward centrist Democrats who were vital in sweeping the party back into control of the House in 2018. Sanders’ embrace of democratic socialism is particularly scary to such educated moderates, who, above all, are looking for the most “electable” candidate to take on Trump this fall. “Bernie is Captain 35%. That’s the magic number of the ultra-liberal, ultra-progressives that are standing with him bar none,” Democratic pollster Jeff Pollock said. “He failed to grow.” As disappointing as that may be for Sanders, it’s also a warning sign for Trump, who has repeatedly tailored his appeal to his most fervent supporters. Both men found success in 2016 in part because they could benefit from the public’s harsh judgment of Hillary Clinton, who contended with both unwarranted sexism and self-inflicted wounds built up over more than three decades in the public eye. Without Clinton as a foil in 2020, the appeal of Sanders didn’t seem to expand beyond his most loyal supporters. Trump could face the same challenge in the fall.  “Joe Biden doesn’t have those enemies,” Pollock said. Biden faces plenty of challenges. Trump and his allies are revving up their attacks on the former vice president  and have been stunningly effective in defining their opponents in the past.  And, for better or worse, the public has a clear understanding of Sanders’ view of the world, defined mostly by his unyielding push to scrap private insurance with a government-run system. Biden’s doctrine often seems less clear beyond being the candidate seen as having the best chance to beat Trump.  “I cannot tell you how many people our campaign has spoken to who have said, ‘I like what your campaign stands for. I agree with what your campaign stands for. But I’m gonna vote for Joe Biden because I think Joe is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump,’” Sanders lamented Wednesday. Simply being a more moderate, palatable alternative to Trump may not be enough to win an election, as Clinton learned in 2016 after she positioned her campaign as a unifying counter to divisive polarization.  “I have voted for a moderate Democrat every election since I was 18 and (Al) Gore was our candidate, and a moderate Democrat has lost every election,” said Jennifer Epps-Addison, the co-executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy Action, which had endorsed Sanders.  Despite the best wishes of his fervent supporters, Sanders is showing no sign of expanding his support as Biden grows his diverse coalition of African Americans, working-class whites and suburbanites. And Sanders is quickly running out of chances to prove he can win this race. Biden’s campaign released a memo Wednesday night highlighting Sanders’ shrinking path to the Democratic presidential nomination.  “Should our broad base of support remain — and we have seen no signs that would indicate otherwise — it will be nearly impossible for Sanders to recoup his current delegate disadvantage,” the Biden campaign wrote. ___ Peoples reported from New York. ___ EDITOR’S NOTE — Associated Press writer Will Weissert has been covering politics for the AP since 2012.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — Three service members were killed, including two Americans, and a dozen more were injured when a barrage of rockets were fired at a military base in Iraq, U.S. officials said Wednesday. One of the officials said five service members were seriously wounded and evacuated from the Camp Taji base and seven others were still being evaluated. Buildings on the base were in flames. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to give details of the attack ahead of a public announcement. Army Col. Myles Caggins, a U.S. military spokesman in Iraq, confirmed that three personnel from the U.S.-led coalition were killed and about 12 were wounded, but did not provide details about what country they were from. The U.S. military said that the names of those killed would be released after family notifications.  Caggins, in a statement, said that about 18 107mm Katyusha rockets struck the base and that Iraqi Security Forces found a rocket-rigged truck a few miles from Camp Taji. Such Russian rockets have been used in the past by Iranian-backed militia groups in Iraq. Another U.S. official said that as many as 30 rockets were fired from the truck launcher, but 18 hit the base.  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed that a U.K. soldier had been killed in the “abhorrent” attack on the Taji base. The Ministry of Defense said the soldier, whose name has not been released, was from the Royal Army Medical Corps. Johnson said Britain was “in close contact with our Coalition partners to establish exactly what happened.” There are about 400 U.K. soldiers in Iraq, training Iraqi and Kurdish security forces. Officials did not say what group they believe launched the rocket attack, but Kataib Hezbollah or another Iranian-backed Shia militia group is likely. Camp Taji, located just north of Baghdad, has been used as a training base for a number of years. There are as many as 6,000 U.S. troops in Iraq, training and advising Iraqi forces and conducting counterterror missions. Kataib Hezbollah was responsible for a late December rocket attack on a military base in Kirkuk that killed a U.S. contractor, prompting American military strikes in response.  That in turn led to protests at the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. They were followed January 3 by a U.S. airstrike that killed Iran’s most powerful military officer, Gen. Qassem Soleimani, and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a leader of the Iran-backed militias in Iraq, of which Kataib Hezbollah is a member. Kataib Hezbollah been designated a “foreign terrorist organization” by the State Department since 2009.  Later on Wednesday, Syrian opposition activists and a war monitor reported an airstrike that targeted Iranian militia positions along the Iraq-Syria border.  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported 10 airstrikes carried out by three unidentified aircraft that targeted pro-Iran militias in the Boukamal region in eastern Syria, near the border with Iraq. The Britain-based Observatory which monitors the Syria war through a network of activists on the ground said at least 10 explosions were heard in the region but said there was no immediate word on casualties.  U.S. officials said the strike was not related to the Taji base strike at all. But it was not immediately clear who conducted the attack.  Syrian activist Omar Abu Layla said the unidentified airstrike targeted Iranian militia positions in the Boukamal region.  Syrian state-run media also reported an aerial attack in the Boukamal region near the Iraqi border that caused material damage.  ____ Associated Press writer Zeina Karam in Beirut contributed to this report.","US officials say US troops killed, injured in Iraq attack",2020-03-12T01:27:44Z,https://apnews.com/75232f9dbbc25b0d133331fbde7f78c8,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — Podiums get sanitized before the candidate steps up to speak. Fist or elbow bumps take the place of handshakes, and kissing babies is out of the question. Rallies are canceled, leaving candidates speaking to a handful of journalists and staffers instead of cheering crowds of thousands. This is campaigning in the age of the coronavirus, when fears of the new pandemic’s rapid spread  are upending Joe Biden’s and Bernie Sanders’ campaigns. The urgency of the issue comes at a pivotal time in the Democratic presidential primary, as Biden is beginning to pull ahead as a front-runner for the nomination and as Sanders is scrambling to catch up.  “If coronavirus has the lasting impact that we all fear it will, it will also dramatically reshape the way a presidential campaign unfolds,” said Jesse Ferguson, a veteran Democratic strategist and former spokesman for Hillary Clinton’s campaign. “Politics is fundamentally about leaders interacting with the people who they represent, and if a pandemic forecloses that ability, it changes everything — how you campaign, how you knock doors, how you do events and how you do the retail part of politics.” While coronavirus concerns have been building as new cases crop up daily and as Democrats criticize President Donald Trump for what they consider a lackluster response, Tuesday marked the first moment the issue affected the campaigns in a substantive way. Both Biden and Sanders decided to cancel planned election-night rallies in Ohio at the advice of local health officials. And so Biden -- who won at least four of the six states voting Tuesday -- delivered a victory speech to a crowd almost entirely composed of media and dozens of staffers who had wandered over from headquarters. It was hardly the big celebration Biden had hoped for on one of the biggest nights of his 2020 campaign. It’s not the first time a major national crisis has upended the contours of a presidential race. During the 2008 campaign, as the economy was in free fall, Republican nominee John McCain returned to Washington to work on the congressional response to the crisis in an effort to revive his flagging campaign. Steve Schmidt, McCain’s top adviser, has said the coronavirus crisis could be particularly problematic for Sanders — and for Trump. “The raw politics of this is that it freezes the Democratic race in place for Bernie Sanders, who is on his last legs. You can’t have a revolution without rallies,” he said. Trump, meanwhile, delights in turning out tens of thousands of supporters to his events and has kept up a steady calendar of rallies in recent months. “The Trump show is sustained by rallies,” he said. While they have not said they are holding off on rallies, Trump’s campaign doesn’t have any on the schedule — a rare break to his persistent counterprogramming.  The campaign postponed a “Women for Trump” bus tour through Michigan, citing “scheduling conflicts,” after the husband of a participant came into contact with someone who tested positive for the virus at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington. Late Wednesday, the White House announced Trump would cancel his trips to Colorado and Nevada “out of an abundance of caution” amid the coronavirus outbreak. He was set to leave Thursday for a Western swing that would include a pair of fundraisers and an appearance at the annual gathering of the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas — just the kind of event that public health officials had been urging people to avoid. The 73-year-old president has also continued to shake hands and speak at large gatherings, despite public health warnings directed at people his age. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 58,000 have so far recovered. While Trump continues his handshaking, those warnings from officials could affect the way Biden campaigns. While the former vice president typically holds smaller events and has only consistently turned out crowds in the thousands since winning South Carolina on Feb. 29, he’s known for his personal, often physical interactions with voters. He often doles out hugs or goes forehead-to-forehead with a voter to share an emotional moment. Rick Hasen, an election law expert and professor at the University of California’s Irvine School of Law, joked that Biden may have “some things to learn about social distancing.” Indeed, even Biden’s senior adviser Anita Dunn was trading elbow bumps instead of handshakes with a reporter on the trail this week. It’s not just rallies that face restrictions with the spread of the new coronavirus. The Democrats’ next debate, being held Sunday in Arizona, will not have a live audience at the request of both campaigns. One major concern for the candidates is turnout -- particularly among older voters, who make up a key portion of Biden’s base. “I certainly think that it has the potential to cause both voters and poll workers to want to stay away from places where people gather,” Hasen said. Election officials in Ohio and Chicago announced they’re moving polling centers out of senior centers and nursing homes, which could make it tougher for seniors to vote and create confusion for voters. Some Democratic operatives have expressed concerns that some states could see a shortage in volunteers on Election Day. Election officials in Florida, where early voting is underway, are sanitizing voting machines hourly with disinfectant wipes. Kelly Dietrich, CEO of the National Democratic Training Committee, a group that trains Democrats who want to run for office or work on a campaign, said they’re already seeing a decline in people who have registered to participate in their training over fear of showing up to large gatherings. “That fear is a prime motivator. It’s going to affect your campaign. It needs to be taken into account,” Dietrich added. The Sanders campaign held a call with staff and advisers to go over new organizing protocols on Wednesday. Signs of heightened concern could be seen on the Biden campaign trail earlier this week. His press aides offered liberal doses of hand sanitizer as his traveling press boarded their plane. And at a high-dollar fundraiser this week in Detroit, boxes of disinfectant wet wipes were placed on the cocktail tables. But even as the outbreak scrambles the campaigns’ operational plans, it offers Democrats an opportunity to draw a contrast with Trump on presidential leadership. “In a situation like this, coronavirus or a financial crisis, you see in real time how the candidates would react if they were president,” Schmidt said. Seeking to calm financial markets during an election year, Trump has repeatedly downplayed the threat posed by the virus, insisting that it will simply sort itself out. But his administration on Wednesday appeared to be coming to terms with the widespread impact as it considered more drastic measures. To that effect, Biden is giving an address Thursday outlining how he would address the outbreak as president. On Wednesday, he announced the formation of a “Public Health Advisory Committee,” comprised of five doctors and a former Obama counterterrorism adviser, that will “provide science-based, expert advice” to the campaign on ways it can minimize health risks. Sanders has argued that the outbreak underscores the need for “Medicare for All” to avoid steep hospital bills for people who contract — or think they may have contracted — the new coronavirus. “This crisis, this absurd health care system, is becoming more and more obvious to the American people as we face the challenge of a coronavirus pandemic,” he said Wednesday. “Imagine facing a pandemic and having 87 million people who are having a difficult time going to a doctor when they need.” ___ Associated Press writer Jill Colvin in Washington contributed to this report. ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.” ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — There’s one thing the Trump administration wants Americans to remember about the coronavirus pandemic: It carries the “Made in China” label. Trump administration officials, on the defensive about their own handling of the virus, have repeatedly reminded people that the virus started in Wuhan, a city in China’s Hubei province, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo referring to it as the “Wuhan coronavirus.” President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, went even further on Wednesday.  “Unfortunately, rather than using best practices, this outbreak in Wuhan was covered up,” O’Brien said at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative-leaning think tank in Washington. “There’s lots of open-source reporting from China, from Chinese nationals, that the doctors involved were either silenced or put in isolation, or that sort of thing, so that the word of this virus could not get out. It probably cost the world community two months.” O’Brien said that if experts would have had those two months to get ahead of the spread of the virus, “I think we could have dramatically curtailed what happened both in China and what’s now happening across the world.”  O’Brien’s remarks seemed to be aimed at countering a disinformation campaign that Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., says China’s Communist Party is waging to blame the U.S. for the virus so it can dampen discontent in China, distract from true infection rates and “save face internationally.” “The Chinese military portal Xilu.com recently published an article baselessly claiming that the virus is ‘a biochemical weapon produced by the U.S. to target China,’” Rubio wrote. China, however, says it is helping the international community battle the virus. U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun told reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York that Beijing is working closely with other countries and have provided medical supplies to nations, including Korea, Japan and Italy.  “We are sending medical teams to countries that need that, and we will do whatever to join the international community to fight this virus ... because we have only one world, we need to join hands, we need to show solidarity.” Rubio claims that besides China, disinformation is coming from Russia and Iran, the hardest-hit country in the Middle East. “In Qom, ground zero of Iran’s coronavirus outbreak, a prominent cleric accused the United States of introducing the virus ‘to damage (the city’s) culture and honor,’” Rubio wrote.  While Trump has lauded Chinese President Xi Jinping’s work to respond to the virus, Trump himself has referred to “China’s Coronavirus situation.” Trump has been criticized for playing down the virus, contradicting his own public health officials and concentrating more on the economic fallout from the outbreak. In a speech to the nation Wednesday night he referred to the “foreign virus” that “started in China.” (He also worked in some digs at Europe for letting it spiral out of control there.) For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 58,000 have so far recovered. Health professionals, who depend on China for access to the country, have publicly praised Beijing for its response, noting that it is difficult to spot a new virus during flu season when there are numerous alerts about atypical pneumonia and other respiratory problems.  On Capitol Hill, Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, praised China’s work to control the spread of coronavirus. “They really have now got control of their outbreak,” Redfield told the House Oversight and Reform Committee on Wednesday. Chinese health officials informed the WHO about the new virus on Dec. 31. By Jan. 8, it had been identified as a new coronavirus, a large family that causes the common cold and more serious illnesses including SARS, which also began in China. By Jan. 12, Chinese scientists had sequenced the virus’ genetic makeup and shared it with WHO, drawing praise for their transparency and swift action. O’Brien is right, however, in noting some missteps in China.  The local Wuhan heath commission reported no new cases from Jan. 5-10 and again from Jan. 12-16. China’s Lunar New Year rush — the world’s largest annual human migration — began to get underway, with millions of people passing through Wuhan, a major transit hub. A recently submitted complaint to the country’s National Health Commission alleged that during this period, officials with the Wuhan health commission told doctors they were not allowed to report about the new virus, letting patients wander around freely instead of being isolated. China’s foreign ministry has taken offense at people blaming China. After Pompeo called it the “Wuhan coronavirus,” the ministry’s spokesman said the description was “despicable,” disrespected science and stigmatized China.  Other Republicans also have specifically pointed how the outbreak was first reported in China. Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., a dentist who is self-quarantined after coming into contact with an infected individual, called it “Wuhan virus” and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy called it the “Chinese coronavirus.” On Thursday, leaders of the Asian Pacific American, Hispanic, Black and Native American congressional caucuses called on McCarthy and Gosar to apologize and noted that the CDC’s chief medical officer, Dr. Mitch Wolfe, has said, “Stigma is the enemy of public health.” ___ Associated Press writers Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar in Washington and Edith Lederer at the United Nations contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump announced Wednesday night that he will instruct the Treasury Department to allow individuals and businesses negatively affected by the coronavirus to defer their tax payments beyond the April 15 filing deadline. In an address from the Oval Office, Trump said he would use his emergency authority to allow individual taxpayers ad businesses to defer paying their taxes by next month’s deadline if they have suffered adverse effects from the spreading virus. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Congress earlier Wednesday that the payment delay would have the effect of putting more than $200 billion back into the economy that would otherwise go to paying taxes next month. He did not indicate what the new deadline would be. Mnuchin told reporters that the delay would cover “virtually all Americans other than the super-rich.” He said the delay would not apply to large corporations or very wealthy taxpayers but he did not offer any specific income or asset thresholds that would be needed to qualify for the delay. Mnuchin told a House Appropriations subcommittee that the administration could grant the tax delay without having to go to Congress for approval.  Mnuchin said the delay would allow individuals to not pay their taxes by the April 15 deadline. The IRS would also waive interest payments or other penalties for missing the deadline. Under current IRS rules, taxpayers can get an automatic extension on filing their tax returns but they are required to pay tax on the estimated amount they will owe when they do file. Members of Congress have urged the administration to take this step amid the coronavirus crisis. “Given the growing nationwide concerns regarding the potential spread and the resulting economic and public health impact of such an outbreak, we urge you to act quickly and remove one source of stress that individuals face during the crisis,” Sens. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., and Patty Murray, D-Wash., said in a letter to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig. “The American people should not have to worry about filing IRS forms in the middle of a public health emergency,” the two senators wrote. In addition to using emergency authority to allow taxpayers who have been affected by the virus to defer their taxes, the president said, effective immediately, he would have the Small Business Administration start providing low-interest loans for businesses in states and U.S. territories that have been affected by the virus. He said these loans would help small businesses overcome the economic disruptions that have been caused by the virus. In addition, he said he would request that Congress boost this loan pool by providing an additional $50 billion in funding for the SBA. Trump said he would also take emergency action to provide financial relief to allow working Americans who have been affected by the virus to stay at home if they are ill, quarantined or taking care of others dealing with the coronavirus. He said he would ask Congress to provide additional funding for this worker relief.",Trump announces delay of tax deadline for virus victims,2020-03-12T03:53:58Z,https://apnews.com/95b0a0bcf0d27e7fa018951b122cf1ec,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump incorrectly stated in his address to the nation that the health insurance industry has agreed to waive patient co-payments for treatment of COVID-19. The industry has not made such a commitment.  Instead, insurers agreed to cover the full cost of diagnostic tests to see whether people have the disease. That step does not shield insured people from potentially high medical bills as a result of getting sick from the coronavirus. Trump’s misstatement on health insurance was one of a number of claims in his prime-time address  that were at odds with the facts. He inaccurately described part of his own plan to restrict travel from Europe  and appeared to hold out false hope that people infected in the current outbreak will see new treatments to hasten their healing. A look at his remarks Wednesday night: TRUMP: “Earlier this week, I met with the leaders of (the) health insurance industry, who have agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments, extend insurance coverage to these treatments, and to prevent surprise medical billing.” THE FACTS: No, they did not say they will cover co-pays for treatment. And Trump’s statement about surprise medical billing is questionable. As Vice President Mike Pence stated more accurately, the insurers agreed to cover coronavirus testing with no cost sharing — so no co-pays or deductibles. That assurance applies to tests that can confirm or rule out the virus, and doesn’t extend to treatment or to other tests that the patient’s doctor may order. Consumers should check with their insurance company because policies may vary on this. They should not count on the president’s word. What’s more, in the process of diagnosing COVID-19, other tests may be ordered. Insurers have not pledged to waive cost-sharing for those. Co-pays and deductibles may apply for imaging tests such as X-rays or CT scans of the chest, for example, and hospital stays are also subject to cost-sharing. Federal programs including Medicare, Medicaid, children’s health insurance and “Obamacare” all cover the coronavirus tests. Of particular importance, clinical diagnostic tests are covered under Medicare with no cost-sharing, a longstanding policy. However, cost-sharing may apply for other tests, such as imaging. When people get sick from the coronavirus, there currently is no antiviral treatment that can cure the disease. Instead, the current treatment is geared to relieving patients’ symptoms and helping them to recover. For those who are very sick, that can involve using machinery to help them breathe. Insurers cover such treatment based on the terms of the individual’s health plan, including any applicable deductibles and co-pays. As for “surprise billing,” that’s not something insurers can waive because they’re not the ones who do it. Doctors and hospitals generally spring those surprises. Overall, says Karen Pollitz of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation: “We don’t have a rule yet that says all insurers must do ‘x,’ so flip your insurance card over and call the 800 number.”  For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.  ___ TRUMP: “We are cutting massive amounts of red tape to make antiviral therapies available in record time. These treatments will significantly reduce the impact and reach of the virus.” THE FACTS: People suffering from COVID-19 or those who get it in the current outbreak should not expect those therapies to be available to them. Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health told a congressional committee Wednesday that while antivirals are being tested, “we don’t know if it works. I don’t want to promise anything.” An antiviral is a medicine that specifically attacks a virus to hasten recovery. An experimental drug named remdesivir, which was being developed to fight Ebola, is being tested in COVID-19 patients in the U.S. and abroad. There also are studies underway using combinations of some HIV-attacking drugs. ___ TRUMP: “We will be suspending all travel from Europe, except the United Kingdom, for the next 30 days.” THE FACTS: That’s not exactly his plan.  First, the restriction does not apply to legal permanent residents of the U.S. or their families when they are returning from Europe. It also does not apply to U.S. citizens coming back from Europe, as Trump acknowledged. As well, it apparently does not apply to Ireland, Romania, Croatia, Ukraine and several other European states. The proclamation released by the White House says the travel ban will affect the 26 European states in what’s known as the Schengen Area. That’s most of Europe, but not “all.” ___ TRUMP: “These prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things as we get approval.”  THE FACT: That is also wrong. The White House quickly clarified that the restriction on movement from Europe “only applies to human beings, not goods and cargo.” ___ EDITOR’S NOTE — A look at the veracity of claims by political figures. ___  Associated Press writers Jill Colvin, Lauran Neergaard, Zeke Miller and Tom Murphy contributed to this report. ___ Find AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd  Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck",AP FACT CHECK: Trump is wrong about insurers and coronavirus,2020-03-12T03:31:45Z,https://apnews.com/fb47f78357ea4a29c824dd36cc206e69,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. lawmakers pushed Wednesday for a ban on imports from a vast area of northwestern China because of the widespread use of forced labor in a region where the communist government has detained more than a million people in a campaign against ethnic minorities. The U.S. already bans imports made with forced labor, but a bipartisan group of lawmakers said virtually anything coming from Xinjiang, including goods sold by major American and global consumer brands, should be considered tainted by the mass detention and repression of Uighurs and other ethnic minorities. “We know forced labor is widespread and systematic and exists both within and outside the mass internment camps,” said Rep. Jim McGovern, referring to detention centers where the Chinese government is subjecting hundreds of thousands of Uighurs to abusive conditions, torture and political indoctrination. McGovern, a Democrat from Massachusetts, is co-chairman of the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which released a report that documented forced labor. It found it in the mass internment camps, on farms in Xinjiang, that produce cotton for the global market as well as factories elsewhere in the country. The report said major brands, including Coca-Cola, Patagonia and Nike, are suspected of directly or indirectly relying on forced labor. The commission relied on outside experts, satellite imagery, official reports and accounts from The Associated Press and other media organizations. Bipartisan legislation introduced Wednesday would treat all goods from Xianjiang, including clothing and electronic goods sold by major U.S. and global brands, as presumed to be banned unless they were certified by Customs and Border Protection. “It shifts the burden of proof and the presumption that, given these practices and what’s detailed in this report, we should assume that anything that is produced in this region is done so through forced labor,” said Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who is the other co-chairman of the commission. It’s not clear when Congress would take up the bill. Legislation that would more broadly address China’s campaign against the Uighurs passed without opposition last year, but the House and Senate must still reconcile different versions and send it to the president. A report earlier this month from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute estimated that more than 80,000 Uighurs were transferred from Xinjiang to factories across China between 2017 and 2019. The report said it found “conditions that strongly suggest forced labor” consistent with International Labor Organization definitions. Separately, the AP reported last week that a sprawling Chinese factor that turns out computer screens, cameras and fingerprint scanners for global tech giants also appears to be holding Uighurs and other ethnic minorities under coercive conditions. Corporations mentioned in the report have had varied responses. Coca-Cola said in a statement it prohibits the use of all forms of forced labor and said its sugar supplier in Xinjiang passed an internal audit.  In January 2019, Badger Sportswear, a leading supplier of T-shirts and other apparel to U.S. college bookstores, cut ties with a Chinese company after an AP investigation traced shipments from a factory inside an internment camp in Xinjiang.  Nike said in a statement that it does not directly source any products in the Xinjiang region and has been reviewing suppliers outside the area “to identify and assess potential risks” to Uighurs and other minorities amid reports that some have been sent to other parts of China to work under repressive conditions. “Nike is committed to upholding international labor standards and we are continuing to evaluate how to best monitor our compliance standards in light of the complexity of this situation,” the company said. Patagonia said it works with the Fair Labor Association to ensure materials in its supply chain are not produced with forced labor and that none of its finished products comes from Xinjiang.  “We support the Fair Labor Association’s call for an immediate end to forced labor and other human rights abuses against Uighurs in China,” the company said in a statement. “We’ve been horrified by what we’ve read in the media regarding a systemic, planned effort to force the country’s population of ethnic minorities into lives of factory work and a program to change their basic beliefs.” A coalition of retailing and manufacturing groups said in a joint statement that they do not tolerate forced labor and that companies are working with experts to ensure the fair treatment of workers in their supply chains. It called on the U.S. government to create a working group that would find “constructive solutions” but did not directly address the proposed legislation. “The conditions in Xinjiang and the treatment of ethnic minority workers from the region present profound challenges to the integrity of the global supply chain, including issues of transparency, access, and auditing,” it said. “Accepting the status quo is not an option.”  China has long suspected that Uighurs, who are predominantly Muslim and culturally and ethnically distinct from the majority Han Chinese population, of harboring separatist tendencies. In recent years, though, it has dramatically escalated its campaign against them by detaining more than a million people in the internment camps and prisons. The Chinese government has dismissed international criticism of the campaign as meddling in its internal affairs and described the camps as vocational training centers. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang rejected the findings of the report and denied the use of forced labor. “The legitimate labor rights and interests of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are protected according to law, and there is no such thing as forced labor as claimed by someone with ulterior motives,” Geng told reporters.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser declared a state of emergency Wednesday as the number of identified coronavirus cases in the nation’s capital reached 10 and officials recommended gatherings of 1,000 or more people be postponed or canceled. The announcement signals a major escalation in the District of Columbia’s response to the spread of the virus.  “We’re not in a vacuum. Our country is experiencing this and our world is experiencing this,” Bowser told a news conference. “We’re asking residents, businesses and visitors to help us flatten the curve” of the virus’ spread.  Bowser declared both a state of emergency and a public health emergency. The declarations give her the authority to order medical quarantines, request federal assistance and take steps to stem price gouging on critical supplies. The city has leased a building as a potential quarantine facility. Officials declined to disclose the location and said the facility, which will be able to a house about 50 people, is not being used yet. Organizers of the popular Cherry Blossom festival, which was scheduled to begin March 20 and traditionally attracts throngs of visitors to the nation’s capital, announced that several events would be postponed.  “It is a difficult decision and one that we do not take lightly, said Diana Mayhew, President and CEO of the National Cherry Blossom Festival. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.  The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. Earlier Wednesday, officials recommended that all “non-essential mass gatherings, including conferences and conventions,” be postponed or canceled through the end of March. They defined mass gatherings as “events where 1,000 or more people congregate in a specific location.” The announcements have massive implications for Washington’s many museums, events and performance venues. Tourists still arrived at the U.S. Capitol, but an official unauthorized to discuss the situation and speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed that tours would soon be shut down.  The city’s St. Patrick’s Day parade has been postponed, and Eileen Andrews, a spokeswoman for the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, said they were assessing the city’s recommendation. The popular 9:30 Club concert venue announced it was cancelling all concerts through the end of the month. Lauren Lyons, a spokeswoman for the Smithsonian network of museums, said in an email, “As of now the Smithsonian is continuing to welcome guests to our museums and scheduled public programs as normal.” The Washington Wizards basketball team had been scheduled to play a home game on Sunday, but the NBA suspended the entire season late Wednesday night.  Monumental Sports & Entertainment said Wednesday afternoon that Washington Capitals hockey games would be played as scheduled before spectators and that other events at Capital One Arena would go on “at the direction of their respective promoters.” The arena will host the Capitals vs the Detroit Red Wings on Thursday night.  Events DC, which operates the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, is suspending operations there from March 13 to March 31. It disclosed that five people who attended the recent American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference there had tested positive for the coronavirus, up from the two that AIPAC had publicly reported.  Events DC President Greg O’Dell said he was working with the Capital City Go Go, the G-league affiliate of the Wizards, to come up with alternatives for the three games scheduled during the rest of March. Events DC also owns Nationals Park, home of the reigning baseball world champions. With an opening game scheduled for April 2, O’Dell said the decision on whether to hold it would lie with the team and the D.C. government.  “Right now we just want to move forward with proactive measures and prioritize the health and safety of our staff and our guests,” he said. Also Wednesday, Georgetown University joined the growing list of higher-learning institutions to cancel in-person classes  The announcement came a day after American University in Washington made a similar move. As with AU, the Georgetown dorms will remain open, but students are encouraged to return home instead of staying on campus. Georgetown has reported no suspected cases of coronavirus infections on campus. However, the university hospital is treating Washington, D.C.’s, first identified victim.  Rev. Tim Cole, rector of Christ Church Georgetown Episcopal church, identified himself over the weekend as the city’s first patient. City officials asked several hundred people who entered the church on days when Cole was present and symptomatic to quarantine themselves. Two subsequent positive infection cases, one living in Washington and the other in Virginia, have been Christ Church parishioners. The church has canceled all services and activities indefinitely. Cole released an open letter to his parishioners Tuesday, saying he was improving slowly. “Being the first point of outbreak in Washington obviously required strong measures, but I fully understand the inconvenience, and I deeply apologize,” Cole wrote.  The District of Columbia’s tally of positive infection cases doesn’t include people who may have been infected in Washington but live in nearby northern Virginia or southern Maryland. For example, Loudoun County, Virginia, has reported a positive case in a local resident who is a Christ Church congregant.  Some Washington schools have closed for one day to enable deep cleaning. The district’s public school system on Wednesday announced it would move a planned professional development day for teachers and staff from March 20 up to Monday to focus the day on virus-related training and preparation.  About a half-dozen members of Congress are on a 14-day self-quarantine after coming in contact with potentially infected people. On Tuesday, Virginia Democratic Rep. Don Beyer announced he would self-quarantine after dining 10 days ago with a person who tested positive for the virus.  ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — Joe Biden decisively won Michigan’s Democratic presidential primary, seizing a key battleground state that helped propel Bernie Sanders’ insurgent candidacy four years ago. The former vice president’s victory there, as well as in Missouri, Mississippi and Idaho, dealt a serious blow to Sanders and substantially widened Biden’s path to the nomination. Biden again showed strength Tuesday with working-class voters and African Americans, who are vital to winning the Democratic nomination.  Sanders won North Dakota and awaited results from Washington state, where all votes are cast by mail or by dropping them off in a ballot box. Washington’s primary was too early to call Wednesday evening. Following the release of updated results, Biden led Sanders by a little more than 16,000 votes out of nearly 1.2 million counted, or a margin of 1.4 percentage points. The six-state contest Tuesday marked the first time voters weighed in on the primary since it effectively narrowed to a two-person race between Sanders and Biden. And the first four states on Tuesday went to Biden, a dramatic reversal for a campaign that appeared on the brink of collapse just two weeks ago. Now it is Sanders, whose candidacy was ascendant so recently, who must contemplate a path forward. He said at a news conference in Vermont on Wednesday afternoon that he will stay in the race and plans to appear at the Democratic debate against Biden on Sunday. Addressing supporters in Philadelphia, Biden noted that many had “declared that this candidacy was dead” only days ago, but “now we’re very much alive.” He also asked Sanders supporters to back him going forward.  “We need you, we want you, and there’s a place in our campaign for each of you. I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion,” Biden said. “We share a common goal, and together we’ll beat Donald Trump.” Even as the contours of the race came into shape, however, new uncertainty was sparked by fears of the spreading coronavirus. Both candidates abruptly canceled rallies in Ohio that were scheduled for Tuesday night. Sanders’ campaign also said all future events would be decided on a case-by-case basis given public health concerns, while Biden called off a scheduled upcoming Florida stop. He also announced that Friday and Monday stops in Florida and Illinois would be turned into virtual events. Still, the former vice president said Tuesday night that he’d be announcing plans to combat the coronavirus later this week.  The Democratic National Committee also said that Sunday’s debate between Sanders and Biden would be conducted without an audience.  Among former White House hopefuls and leaders of powerful liberal groups, however, Biden’s momentum is now undeniable.  Bradley Beychok, president and co-founder of American Bridge 21st Century, a liberal super PAC, said his group “will be ALL IN to elect @JoeBiden as our next president.” The organization is spending millions of dollars trying to win over people who backed President Donald Trump in key states in 2016. Guy Cecil, chairman of the flagship Democratic outside political organization Priorities USA, tweeted: “The math is now clear. Joe Biden is going to be the Democratic nominee for President and @prioritiesUSA is going to do everything we can to help him defeat Donald Trump in November.” There were other major warning signs for Sanders on Tuesday. He again struggled to win support from black voters. About 70% of Mississippi’s Democratic primary voters were African American, and 86% of them supported Biden, according to an AP VoteCast survey of the electorate. After Sanders upset Hillary Clinton in Michigan four years ago, his loss there Tuesday was particularly sobering. It undermined his argument that he could appeal to working-class voters and that he could expand the electorate with new young voters. One of the few bright notes for Sanders was his strength among young voters, but even that has a downside because they didn’t turn out enough to keep him competitive. Sanders won 72% of those under 30 in Missouri and 65% in Michigan, according to AP VoteCast. The senator was also about even with Biden among voters ages 30 to 44. Sanders’ mathematical path to winning enough delegates for the nomination is rapidly disappearing. Sanders now needs 57% of the delegates not won so far to get to 1991, the magic number to win the nomination. Both delegate allocation math and voting history show how unlikely it is for Sanders to hit that goal and overtake Biden. “There’s no sugarcoating it. Tonight’s a tough night,” New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of Sanders’ highest-profile supporters, said on Instagram. “Tonight’s a tough night for the movement overall. Tonight’s a tough night electorally.” Another top Sanders backer, Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, tweeted: “Yes we are a family, united in restoring our democracy and committed to defeating Trump, but that doesn’t mean we should stop fighting for the candidate that best represents our policy priorities in this Primary.” According to an Associated Press analysis, Biden picked up at least 184 new delegates in Tuesday’s voting while Sanders got 112. Biden now has 864 overall, while Sanders has 710. Although six states voted, Michigan, with its 125 delegates, got most of the attention. Trump won the state by only 10,704 votes during the general election, his closest margin of victory among Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Those states gave Trump the narrow edge in the 2016 Electoral College after Clinton won the popular vote. In addition to the powerful groups now siding with Biden, the former vice president has picked up the endorsements of many of his former presidential rivals, including Sen. Kamala Harris, Sen. Cory Booker and entrepreneur Andrew Yang. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, sometimes mentioned as a possible vice presidential choice, also endorsed Biden and campaigned with him. But not every Democrat was lining up behind Biden. Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell, who represents a sprawling district from the college town of Ann Arbor to the Detroit suburbs, said Tuesday that she’s staying neutral.  “I remember what it was like four years ago and the vitriol and the anger, the people mad at each other the whole election cycle. We can’t afford that,” Dingell said. “It’s about getting out and voting in November.” Neither Biden nor Sanders has public events scheduled for Wednesday. And although Biden is celebrating a growing delegate lead, he’s still confronting voters who question his positions, which include a gun control plan that reinstates an assault weapons ban and includes a voluntary buyback program for assault weapons. That issue was at the center of a testy exchange with a worker while Biden was rallying earlier Tuesday in Detroit. The man accused him of “actively trying to end our Second Amendment right.” Biden shot back, “You’re full of shit,” but went on to say that while he supports the Second Amendment, “Do you need 100 rounds?”  ___ Associated Press writers Mike Householder in Detroit and Seth Borenstein in Washington contributed to this report. ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.”",'Very much alive': Biden victorious in 4 more primary states,2020-03-11T05:11:46Z,https://apnews.com/1d5e5fb505a14ce37fd812211a9d9e8c,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — Chelsea Manning’s legal team said Wednesday that the former intelligence analyst tried to take her own life Wednesday, but was transported to a hospital where she is recovering.  Manning has been in jail since May 2019 for refusing to testify before a grand jury investigating WikiLeaks. She was scheduled to appear in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, on Friday for a hearing on a motion to terminate the civil contempt sanctions stemming from that refusal.  In the motion filed last month, Manning’s lawyers argued that Manning has shown during her incarceration that she can’t be coerced into testifying before a grand jury.

"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — The coronavirus threat is forcing elections officials in some states to remove polling places from nursing homes and other senior care facilities to protect older Americans, who appear to be more susceptible to the disease. Last-minute shuffling left voters in Michigan and Missouri scrambling to get to new polling places for their Tuesday primaries. Officials in states voting next week are trying to get ahead of those disruptions by announcing changes now and beginning public information campaigns to tell voters where they are supposed to cast ballots. In Ohio, the elections chief on Monday ordered the relocation of all polling places at nursing homes — more than 140 — just eight days ahead of the state’s primary.  “Obviously, that’s a big step and it requires a lot of work — and our county boards of elections are working to do that right now, as we speak,” Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose told reporters Tuesday.  Moving the polling places may be the right public health move, but it creates challenges for election administrators. Those include informing voters in surrounding areas of the change and ensuring that retirement community residents have transportation to their new polling location. Secretaries of state across the country are taking further steps to guard public health: encouraging voting from a distance, either by mail or by using curbside drop-off locations; creating and updating dedicated websites; partnering with voting rights organizations and campaigns to get the word out; and stocking up on supplies for disinfecting voting machines. In Missouri, officials had to react quickly after two senior living facilities backed out of serving as voting sites less than 24 hours before polls opened for Tuesday’s presidential primary. Election authorities posted signs at the senior facilities redirecting voters to new polling places nearby. A spokeswoman for Brookdale Senior Living, the Kansas City facility’s operator, said the company adopted a policy Monday prohibiting groups of three or more people from entering any of its more than 700 facilities nationwide because of coronavirus concerns. Brookdale also suspended all planned group outings, meaning it couldn’t take residents by bus to the new voting location. Some residents drove themselves or got rides from relatives or friends to the alternative polling place. In Michigan, two private senior facilities requested that polling places in their buildings be relocated because of coronavirus concerns, Secretary of State spokesman Jake Rollow said in an email. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people who get it recover.  As Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio prepare to vote next week, officials are taking varying approaches to the virus threat. In Florida’s Palm Beach County, elections supervisor Wendy Sartory Link is moving 16 polling places out of assisted living facilities so their patients will not be exposed to voters from the community. She has found replacements for 10 at schools, churches and city halls, and believes she’ll be able to relocate the other six. “The health and safety of their residents have to come first,” she said. The moves are being complicated because Link’s poll workers contain a large percentage of senior citizens and many are backing out, fearing infection. She hopes they can be replaced, but isn’t certain. In Lake County, where a quarter of the population is over 65, elections supervisor Alan Hays said relocation is not necessary. Only residents of nursing homes and assisted living facilities vote there, he said, so they are shielded from outsiders even under normal circumstances.  The state’s most populous county, Miami-Dade, also has no plans to move any polling places because of the virus. Steven Vancore, a spokesman for the elections supervisor in Broward County, said just one polling place at an assisted living facility was being relocated at the management’s request. In Illinois, Gov. J.B. Pritzker said the state has asked all 108 local boards of elections to extend the deadline to apply for a mail-in ballot until Monday. He also said the state and the city of Chicago will help move polling places out of nursing homes and other senior facilities, while ensuring that residents still can cast ballots there. “We’re doing our best to accommodate everybody to make sure that we get the kind of vote turnout that we expect,” he said. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said her administration was urging the city’s Board of Election Commissioners to extend its deadline for requesting mail-in ballots. She also suggested voters use in-person early voting locations. Marisel Hernandez, chair of the election commission, said Wednesday that 25 of the city’s 269 polling sites, including nursing homes, must be relocated before Tuesday. Chicago officials expressed doubt about extending their deadline to request a mail-in ballot until Monday, as the governor and mayor suggested, because they said that would put pressure on the postal service and voters. Election officials in the Phoenix area moved five polling places from assisted living or other senior care facilities to protect those residents from the virus, according to the Maricopa County Elections Department, but about eight in 10 voters there cast ballots by mail, limiting polling site traffic. Amber McReynolds, a former Denver election administrator who is now executive director of the National Vote at Home Institute, an advocacy group, said the changes being made during the primaries should be a prelude to even bigger changes in November, when turnout will be greater. She said it’s not enough just to encourage people to request absentee ballots. Rather, she said officials should try to do what a handful of states -- Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah and Washington — already do: Mail ballots to every voter. ___ Associated Press writers Christina A.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — Defying a veto threat, Congress has approved a bipartisan measure to limit President Donald Trump’s authority to launch military operations against Iran.  The House gave final legislative approval to the measure Wednesday, 227-186, sending it to Trump. The president has promised to veto the war powers resolution, warning that if his “hands were tied, Iran would have a field day.”  The resolution, sponsored by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., declares that Trump must win approval from Congress before engaging in further military action against Iran. Kaine and other supporters say the measure is not about Trump or even the presidency, but instead is an important reassertion of congressional power to declare war.  Six Republicans joined 220 Democrats and independent Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan to support the measure. Six Democrats and 180 Republicans opposed it. In the Senate last month, eight Republicans backed the resolution.  The resolution “sends a clear message that the American people don’t want war with Iran and that Congress has not authorized war with Iran,″ said Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. While tensions with Iran have abated since a U.S. drone strike that killed Iran’s top general in early January, the resolution clarifying Congress’ power to declare war is still important, Engel said. “Congress doesn’t have to wait until the president alone decides to use military force again,″ Engel told House members during floor debate Wednesday. “It’s our responsibility to do something, because we know the tensions could flare up again at a moment’s notice. Iran has not been deterred as the administration promised.″ Texas Rep. Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the Foreign Affairs Committee, called the war powers measure “divisive and irresponsible” and based on a false premise. “It orders the president to terminate hostilities against Iran. The problem is, for the other side, we are not engaged in hostilities in Iran,″ McCaul said. If the U.S. military launches strikes in Iran, “I believe that the president would need to come before this body to ask for a new authorization” for the use of force, McCaul said. “But that is not what we are facing.″  The House vote marked a rare exertion of authority from Congress, which also moved to impose restrictions on U.S. involvement with the Saudi-led war in Yemen last year after U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed in a gruesome murder at Saudi Arabia’s consulate in Turkey. Trump promptly vetoed that measure.  The Democratic-controlled House passed a separate, nonbinding resolution on Iran in January, a few weeks before the Senate approved Kaine’s resolution. Two-thirds votes in the House and the GOP-run Senate would be needed to override an expected Trump veto. Kaine hailed the House vote. “For years, Congress has abdicated its responsibility on matters of war, but now a bipartisan majority in both the Senate and House has made clear that we shouldn’t be engaged in hostilities with Iran without a vote of Congress,″ he said in a statement.  The legislation “doesn’t prevent the president from defending the United States against imminent attack,″ but instead “demands that the decision of whether or not we go on offense and send our troops into harm’s way should only be made after serious deliberation and a vote of Congress,″ Kaine added. “If President Trump is serious about his promise to stop endless wars, he will sign this resolution into law.” In a statement of administration policy, the White House said the resolution should be rejected “because it attempts to hinder the president’s ability to protect” U.S. diplomats, forces, allies and partners, including Israel, from the continued threat posed by Iran and its proxies, including militia groups and foreign fighters in Syria. “Iran has a long history of attacking United States and coalition forces both directly and through its proxies,” the White House said, adding the congressional resolution could hinder Trump’s ability to protect U.S. forces and interests in the region.  “This joint resolution is untimely and misguided. Its adoption by Congress could undermine the ability of the United States to protect American citizens whom Iran continues to seek to harm,″ the White House said.  Tehran responded to the U.S. attack on its top general, Qassem Soleimani, by launching missiles at two military bases in Iraq that house American troops. The attack caused traumatic brain injuries in more than 100 U.S. soldiers, the Pentagon said. Democrats and Republicans alike criticized a briefing by the Trump administration shortly after the drone strike, saying U.S. officials offered vague information about a possible attack being planned by Iran but no substantial details. Kaine has long pushed for action reasserting congressional power over military conflict. At the request of Republican senators, he removed initial language that targeted Trump in favor of a generalized statement declaring Congress has sole power to declare war. The resolution also directs Trump to terminate use of military force against Iran or any part of its government without approval from Congress and commends Trump for killing Soleimani, who was long designated a terrorist by the U.S.  “No one lamented the loss of Mr. Soleimani. No one,″ said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md. “That’s not what this bill is about.″ The resolution “is about our Constitution, the authority of this body to declare or not declare war,″ Hoyer added. “It ought to be the representatives of the people that take them to war, not a president — any president, Democrat or Republican. This is about our responsibility.″",Congress acts to limit Trump on military action in Iran,2020-03-11T21:54:28Z,https://apnews.com/aba5befc982a9cec04d2a5b3364550c3,AP
"ATHENS, Ga. (AP) — Georgia’s State Election Board voted on Wednesday to punish election officials in one county for their decision not to use the state’s new voting machines for the presidential primary, and it ordered them to immediately start using the machines again. The Athens-Clarke County Board of Elections voted  3-2 last week to sideline the new machines in favor of hand-marked paper ballots, citing concerns over protecting ballot secrecy when using the machines with large, bright touchscreens that sit upright.  Board Chairman Jesse Evans said it was “impracticable” when using the new machines to protect ballot secrecy and allow sufficient monitoring to prevent tampering as required by state law. The State Election Board, chaired by Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, unanimously ordered the county to cease and desist and to pay a fine of $2,500 for investigative costs, plus $5,000 a day until the machines are back in place. County elections director Charlotte Sosebee said she could have the machines back up by Thursday for a continuation of early voting. Evans said he was disappointed with the state board’s decision and that he would talk to the board and its attorneys to determine next steps. The March 24 presidential primaries mark the first statewide test for Georgia’s new $103 million voting system, which combines electronic touchscreens with printed ballots that are tallied by a scanner.  Athens, about 70 miles (113 kilometers) east of Atlanta, is home to the University of Georgia, and surrounding Clarke County represents about 1% of the state’s registered active voters, according to voter numbers on the secretary of state’s website. Ryan Germany, the general counsel for the secretary of state’s office, noted during the hearing that Georgia law requires the new voting equipment to be used in all 159 counties. He said the section of the law that allows county election officials to substitute paper ballots is an emergency provision that allows some flexibility but doesn’t override the law. Bryan Sells, a lawyer for the county board, said it wasn’t possible in some places for the county to provide enough machines while also protecting ballot secrecy, and it was too close to the March 24 primary to switch polling locations. That meant using the machines was not feasible in certain situations, he said.  The secretary of state’s office in mid-February sent sample layouts to county election officials showing them how to arrange the voting machines to address ballot secrecy concerns. They show machines turned so voters’ backs face a wall or other voters’ backs.  Sosebee said she brought the sample layouts to the county board meeting last week and told board members the layouts would work in all of the county’s polling places. She also said that during two days of early voting before the board-mandated switch to paper ballots, about 500 people voted on the new voting machines and none raised ballot secrecy concerns. But two county residents who voted during those days told the board that if there had been other voters there with them, it would have been easy to see their ballots.  Evans said that during a visit to the polls during early voting, he could clearly see a voting machine screen while talking with elections office staff.  Evans said he had yet to see detailed, to-scale diagrams of the county’s election day polling places with configurations that meet three requirements of state law: one machine for every 250 registered voters, protection of ballot secrecy and ability of poll workers to monitor the machines during voting.",Georgia county punished for ditching voting machines,2020-03-11T05:29:36Z,https://apnews.com/a77bbc58ac8516b474dfa64c87ee690d,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — Bernie Sanders’ mathematical path to winning enough delegates for the Democratic nomination is rapidly disappearing. The Vermont senator now needs 57% of the delegates that are still available to take on President Donald Trump. A candidate needs to collect 1,991 delegates to win the nomination.  Sanders acknowledged the hurdles he faces after former Vice President Joe Biden took 70 more delegates than Sanders during Tuesday’s contests. With more votes being tabulated in Washington state, Biden has a more than 150-delegate lead, which has been growing in March. “Last night obviously was not a good night for our campaign from a delegate point of view,” Sanders told reporters Wednesday in Burlington, Vermont. Both delegate allocation math and voting history show how unlikely it is for Sanders to overtake Biden. When he faced Hillary Clinton in 2016, Sanders only got 55% or more of the delegates in nine of the 32 states or territories that have upcoming contests. And those nine states or territories have only 299 delegates at stake. The other 23 states and territories that have yet to vote have 1,829 delegates up for grabs and in 2016, he only got 41% of the delegates from those locales. Four years ago, Sanders won only 48% of the last 2,020 delegates in the final primaries and caucuses. And in 2008, Clinton got only 45% of the remaining delegates after coming out of Super Tuesday behind Barack Obama. While there are still more than two dozen delegates to be allocated from California’s ongoing vote count, trends would give both Biden and Sanders 10 more with the rest going to other candidates. That means that Sanders is unlikely to gain much more on Biden from the California delegates that have not yet been allocated, according to The Associated Press delegate count. The intricate arithmetic of how delegates are won makes it even tougher for Sanders. Delegates are given out proportionally to candidates who get at least 15% of the vote. And in most cases, that’s both Biden and Sanders and no other candidates, except statewide in Mississippi, where Sanders just missed the mark statewide. When there are an even number of delegates up for grabs in a district or statewide and a race is fairly close, the two candidates often split the delegates. It takes a big margin in votes to pick up an extra delegate.  That makes it rather difficult for the candidate trailing, in this case Sanders, to catch up to the front-runner. After next Tuesday, more than half of the delegates up for grabs will be in these districts with an even number of delegates.",Sanders' formula for delegate victory evaporating in March,2020-03-11T22:17:39Z,https://apnews.com/d75101256d49731bd204306899c4e1f1,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress has taken a first step toward addressing errors made by the FBI during its investigation of the Trump campaign and Russia, with the House passing legislation Wednesday that would impose new restrictions on the federal government’s surveillance tools. The legislation is a compromise that reflects angst in both parties about the way the surveillance powers have been used, but also a reluctance to strip those powers from the government’s arsenal. The bipartisan bill, negotiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, would renew several provisions the FBI sees as vital to fighting terrorism even as it aims to ensure stricter oversight of how the bureau conducts surveillance.  The compromise, which passed 278-136, came after Republicans and Democrats in the House broadly agreed that they did not want civil liberties sacrificed in efforts to thwart terrorism and other crimes. Republicans had been aggressively seeking changes to the law since the Russia investigation, while many Democrats already had concerns about government surveillance.  The Senate is poised to pass the bill, as well, after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell issued a statement with several other Republicans saying they “strongly support this legislation and urge all of our Senate colleagues to join us.”  The statement said the legislation “balances the need to reauthorize these critical authorities with the need for tailored reforms to increase accountability.” Signing on with McConnell were Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, Texas Sen. John Cornyn and South Dakota Sen. John Thune.  It was not immediately clear whether Trump would sign it. And a handful of Republican and Democratic senators have strongly criticized the House measure, possibly threatening procedural delays.  Republican Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky and Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, all longtime skeptics of surveillance laws, are opposed to the legislation. But Wyden indicated he would not filibuster, or delay, the bill, saying he was focused on a response to the spread of the coronavirus.  It wasn’t certain what tactics Paul or Lee might use to slow down the legislation. Lee said Wednesday that “there are a lot of procedural tools at our disposal,” indicating he might try to delay passage. Paul has been working closely with Trump, who told Republican lawmakers at a meeting last week that he would not sign an extension of the current surveillance authorities without reforms. Lawmakers leave town at week’s end. The existing powers expire Sunday. At the behest of Republicans, the House compromise takes aim at some of the missteps the Justice Department has acknowledged making during the Russia investigation. Applications under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to eavesdrop on a former Trump campaign aide were riddled with omissions and missteps, according to an inspector general report. The measure would require that officers responsible for FISA applications certify that the department has been advised of any information that could undercut or contradict the premise of the surveillance. In the Russia investigation, some of the information the FBI omitted from its applications cut against the idea that former Trump adviser Carter Page was a Russian agent, the watchdog found.  Page has denied that and was never charged with wrongdoing.  The bill also would institute criminal penalties and other sanctions for making false statements to the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which issues warrants to the FBI to eavesdrop on people it has probable cause to believe are agents of a foreign power. It would require the attorney general to approve in writing of an investigation if the target of the surveillance is a federal candidate or official. The legislation updates the three expiring surveillance provisions, including one that permits the FBI to obtain court orders to collect business records on subjects in national security investigations. Another, known as the “roving wiretap” provision, permits surveillance on subjects even after they’ve changed phones. The third allows agents to monitor subjects who don’t have ties to international terrorism organizations. Attorney General William Barr was involved in the negotiations with the White House and Congress, and he said Wednesday that he supports the bill. “It is of the utmost important that the Department’s attorneys and investigators always work in a manner consistent with the highest professional standards, and this overall package will help ensure the integrity of the FISA process and protect against future abuses going forward,” Barr said. Some conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats said the compromise did not go far enough.  Democratic Reps. Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, the heads of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said that “Congress can and must do more to protect civil liberties” and announced they would oppose the bill. Republican Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona said he would also oppose it, asserting that it would allow the government to spy on Americans.  But other Republicans who have advocated for change said they would support it. Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, a close ally of Trump’s, said the bill is “a start” that would improve civil liberties. McCarthy called the compromise “a turning point.”  House Democrats who control the chamber said they would continue to work on revising the authorities. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, one of the bill’s sponsors, said Congress still has “a long way to go” on reforms.  _____ AP Congressional Correspondent Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.",House votes to tighten oversight of federal surveillance,2020-03-11T04:19:56Z,https://apnews.com/bab6ef9622f79f701b87238b16348a0b,AP
"CHANTILLY, Va. (AP) — In the darkness, the team suits up quietly, putting on their helmets and tactical gear. Federal agents lug battering rams, bolt cutters and heavy weaponry by foot up a hill on a residential California street that’s softly aglow from street lamps. Then the agents turn onto the walkway of their target’s home.  “Police! Search warrant!” one officer yells as agents bang on the front door. “Police search warrant!” And then three thunderous bangs as the task force breaks down the front door.  Moments later, a reputed member of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, known as CJNG, is walked out in handcuffs.  In early-morning raids Wednesday, agents fanned out across the United States, culminating a six-month investigation with the primary goal of dismantling the upper echelon of CJNG and hoping to get closer to capturing its leader, one of the most wanted men in America. There’s a $10 million reward for the arrest of Nemesio “El Mencho” Oseguera. The gang controls between one-third and two-thirds of the U.S. drug market. It is so violent that members leave piles of bodies in streets and hanging from overpasses in Mexico, and they fill the city of Guadalajara with mass graves. They carry machine guns and hand grenades. They once used rocket launchers to shoot down a Mexican military helicopter.  More than 600 people have been arrested during the operation in recent months, more than 15,000 kilos of meth was seized and nearly $20 million taken as search and arrest warrants were executed. About 250 were arrested Wednesday. “El Mencho and his associates prey on the addicts, and they prey on small towns where they can act as bullies and infiltrate these small towns,” said Wendy Woolcok, the special agent in charge of Drug Enforcement Administration’s special operations division. “They promise hope, and they deliver despair.” For the U.S, combating Mexico’s fastest-growing and most violent gang is a top priority. Law enforcement officials believe the gang has drug distribution hubs in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Houston and Atlanta. It is believed to have a presence in 24 of Mexico’s 32 states. Unlike other cartels, CJNG shows no reluctance in directly attacking police and army patrols and is blamed for the deadliest attacks against law enforcement forces in Mexico. In eliminating rivals, it has carried out spectacular acts of violence. “Their propensity to violence is a big part of it, they’re very violent organization, they’re a well-armed organization, but really the gasoline that was thrown on the fire was synthetic drugs,” said Bill Bodner, the special agent in charge of the DEA’s field office in Los Angeles.  The Associated Press had exclusive access to the raid outside Los Angeles and the national command center. In California, about a dozen team members prepped early Wednesday for their target. They searched the home, a stately, salmon-colored Spanish Colonial-style with a large chandelier in the foyer, palm trees in the front yard, and crawled on the ground to look under cars, including a black Lexus, in the driveway. No shots were fired.  Victor Ochoa, 34, was arrested on drug charges. The DEA alleges he acts as a stash house manger for the cartel. He remained in custody at the Los Angeles County jail Wednesday evening and it wasn’t clear whether he had a defense attorney.  At the command center tucked inside a nondescript government building in northern Virginia, a group of a dozen analysts and agents sat behind computer screens inside a conference room that’s been converted into a command center. As agents were banging down doors across the country, the phones rang at the command center and analysts recorded the number of arrests and amount of drugs seized on printed worksheets.  An analyst entered the information into a DEA computer screen as other analysts ran phone numbers, addresses and nicknames found inside the homes being searched.  The special agent in charge of the special operations division assembled with her team in front of a heat map — red dots glowing darker and darker as more arrests are made, primarily in Texas, California and New Jersey. By 9 a.m., more than 60 people had been taken into custody. Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski, head of the Justice Department’s criminal division, called the operation “the most comprehensive action to date in the Department of Justice’s effort to disrupt, dismantle and ultimately destroy CJNG” While Mexican drug cartels made their money predominantly from marijuana in past decades, the market has somewhat dissipated with the state-level legalization of cannabis in dozens of states across the U.S. Now, they’ve turned to methamphetamine and fentanyl, selling it at almost 14 times the price it cost to make and flooding the streets of the U.S., fueling homelessness and the opioid crisis, and leaving behind another trail of bodies: from overdoses.  The Jalisco Cartel was formed in 2010 from a wing of the Sinaloa cartel based in the western city of Guadalajara. While it once specialized in producing methamphetamine, like most Mexican cartels it has expanded into multidrug shipments including fentanyl, cocaine, meth and heroin.  The cartel is led by the elusive Oseguera, whose bodyguards once shot down a Mexican military helicopter to prevent his arrest. In recent weeks, prosecutors have brought charges against his son, Nemesio Oseguera, also known as “El Menchito” and his daughter, Jessica Johanna Oseguera.  And officials say he’s more dangerous than reputed Mexican drug kingpin and escape artist Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, who as leader of the Sinaloa cartel ran a massive drug conspiracy that spread murder and mayhem for more than two decades. “I think the threat from El Mencho and CJNG is greater right now because in my opinion, at the time Chapo was captured or at the time he was kind of at his at his heyday, so to speak, the Sinaloa Cartel was fractured, it was a little broken up,” Bodner said.  El Chapo was a little flashier, but Mencho and the Jalisco gang see their drug business as just that -- business, Bodner said.  “They have a little bit more discipline. They’re not necessarily into the partying and living the good life, it’s just about the business of drug trafficking and control, and that’s what makes them scarier, Bodner said.  The Jalisco cartel is also known for brazen tactics such as driving around in convoys of pickup trucks marked with the letters “CJNG” and for circulating videos of heavily-armed cartel gunmen in military-style dress. While Mexico says it is no longer concentrating on detaining drug lords, the Mexican government has extradited Oseguera’s son and has detained some of his associates. ___ Associated Press writer Mark Stevenson in Mexico City contributed to this report.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is expected to announce an executive order insisting on American-made medical supplies and pharmaceuticals in response to the coronavirus outbreak, according to a person familiar with the plan, as the White House begins to come to grips with the severity of the situation. Word about the planned announcement, from a person who was not authorized to publicly discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity, comes amid tumult Wednesday in the unfolding crisis. Confirmed cases in the United States are topping 1,000, fluctuations in the financial markets are continuing and Washington is straining to respond. The White House is also considering a host of more aggressive responses to free up additional federal dollars and to address concerns that the administration’s initial response to the pandemic was insufficient. In one order Trump issued Wednesday, he authorized Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to take whatever steps are necessary to allow doctors and nurses to use masks made for industrial use while those made specifically for health care are in short supply. Companies have been seeking legal cover for that. “Those industrials will work for medical,” said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. “We can just do that for an 18-month period and there’d be millions more available.” For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.  The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three weeks to six weeks to recover. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 58,000 have so far recovered. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., raised concerns about diversifying the supply chain and reducing the U.S. reliance on imports, including from China, during a private lunch with Trump and GOP senators this week.  Trump appeared to agree with the senator’s outlook, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to publicly discuss the private session and spoke on condition of anonymity. Rubio praised the forthcoming announcement.  He called the expected order “a very strong first step toward increasing domestic production by enforcing Buy American requirements for pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, as well as fast-tracking approval” by the Food and Drug Administration of “critical products impacted by the coronavirus outbreak’s strain on the supply chain.” China is a key supplier of drug active ingredients, the chemical components that make drugs work, and finished medicines for the U.S. market. Those include the active ingredients for antibiotics and pills to treat common chronic conditions such as heart disease.  Many of China’s active ingredients are shipped to India, which makes much of the global supply of generic drugs. India recently restricted all exports of 13 active pharmaceutical ingredients, and finished drugs made from those chemicals, to protect its domestic drug supply.  The restricted drugs are mostly antibiotics, antiviral drugs and a fever reducer, all of which are used for supportive care of patients with coronavirus symptoms, because there is no approved medicine to treat the virus. U.S. regulators have stressed that other medicines are available to treat patients.  Members of Congress and others since last fall have been raising concerns that the U.S. has become much too dependent on medicines made in Asia, as U.S. and European drugmakers increasingly have outsourced much of their manufacturing to Asia, where labor and materials are far cheaper. ___ Associated Press writers Linda A.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — Three service members were killed, including two Americans, and a dozen more were injured when a barrage of rockets were fired at a military base in Iraq, U.S. officials said Wednesday. One of the officials said five service members were seriously wounded and evacuated from the Camp Taji base and seven others were still being evaluated. Buildings on the base were in flames. Several other U.S. officials confirmed that U.S. troops had been killed and injured, but did not provide numbers. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to give details of the attack ahead of a public announcement. Army Col. Myles Caggins, a U.S. military spokewman in Iraq, said on Twitter that more than 15 small rockets hit Iraq’s Camp Taji base. He provided no details. Another U.S. official said that as many as 30 rockets were fired from a truck launcher, and 18 hit the base.  Officials did not say what group they believe launched the rocket attack, but Kataib Hezbollah or another Iranian-backed Shia militia group is likely. Camp Taji, located just north of Baghdad, has been used as a training base for a number of years. There are as many as 6,000 U.S. troops in Iraq, training and advising Iraqi forces and conducting counterterror missions. Kataib Hezbollah was responsible for a late December rocket attack on a military base in Kirkuk that killed a U.S. contractor, prompting American military strikes in response.  That in turn led to protests at the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. They were followed January 3 by a U.S. airstrike that killed Iran’s most powerful military officer, Gen. Qassem Soleimani, and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a leader of the Iran-backed militias in Iraq, of which Kataib Hezbollah is a member. Kataib Hezbollah been designated a “foreign terrorist organization” by the State Department since 2009.  Later on Wednesday, Syrian opposition activists and a war monitor reported an airstrike that targeted Iranian militia positions along the Iraq-Syria border.  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported 10 airstrikes carried out by three unidentified aircraft that targeted pro-Iran militias in the Boukamal region in eastern Syria, near the border with Iraq. The Britain-based Observatory which monitors the Syria war through a network of activists on the ground said at least 10 explosions were heard in the region but said there was no immediate word on casualties.  U.S. officials said the strike was not related to the Taji base strike at all. But, it was not immediately clear who conducted the attack.  Syrian activist Omar Abu Layla said the unidentified airstrike targeted Iranian militia positions in the Boukamal region.  Syrian state-run media also reported an aerial attack in the Boukamal region near the Iraqi border that caused material damage.  ____ Associated Press writer Zeina Karam in Beirut contributed to this report.","US officials say US troops killed, injured in Iraq attack",2020-03-11T20:31:55Z,https://apnews.com/d1276c5c10e73bec27b0ab440c1cd11b,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and his allies are planning sustained personal and reputational attacks against Joe Biden, casting him as ill-equipped for the presidency and pushing unsubstantiated claims of corruption as he emerges as the favorite for the Democratic nomination. The president and his top campaign aides are stoking division among Democrats, arguing that Biden is only taking the lead in the Democratic contest because the party’s establishment is aligned against progressive rival Bernie Sanders. Fox News host Sean Hannity is portraying the 77-year-old Biden as a doddering old man, devoting nearly 10 minutes of his show Tuesday night to what he called “disturbing” verbal miscues. And some Republicans in the Senate are moving to ensure there will be renewed scrutiny of Biden’s son Hunter and his ties to a Ukrainian gas company that put him on its board while his father was vice president. There’s no evidence that Biden or his son engaged in misconduct with Burisma, the gas company.  The sometimes-misleading tactics are a reprise of Trump’s 2016 playbook against his Republican foes and, ultimately, Hillary Clinton. By deploying the same methods, Trump and his allies believe that voters will favor the president’s combative nature and emphasis on conflict over Biden’s appeal to restore decency and honesty to the White House.  But that burn-it-down style will be tested anew before a Democratic Party that is showing signs of greater unity against Trump than four years ago and hopes to build on victories from the 2018 midterms.  “Increased turnout and all of these big wins across the country make clear voters aren’t buying what Trump is selling this time,” said Scott Mulhauser, a Democratic strategist and former Biden spokesman. “They know the Vice President, they like him and it’s clear they think he can win in November.”  But some Republicans warn against overconfidence by Democrats and note that Trump has a unique ability to define his opponents in ways that resonate. “We’ve seen this movie before. Nobody is better at driving a narrative about his opponents than Donald Trump,” said Republican consultant Terry Sullivan, who ran Marco Rubio’s 2016 presidential campaign. “Love him or hate him, there is no denying that he is a branding master.” Biden has been the most-targeted Democrat of the cycle by Trump’s campaign. The president spent more money attacking Biden on Facebook than all the other Democratic candidates combined, according to the Bully Pulpit campaign tracker. That was true even before Super Tuesday, when Biden shocked his rivals with sweeping victories across the country.  Trump’s focus on Biden reflects concerns from the president and his team that the former vice president could be a tough opponent, particularly among working-class voters who left the Democratic Party in 2016. Biden has argued he can reclaim states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which were crucial to Trump’s victory in 2016.  That argument was bolstered on Tuesday when Biden scored a commanding win in the Michigan primary, attracting support from both African Americans and working-class whites. Trump was so fixated on Biden last year that he asked Ukrainian leaders to investigate him, a move that prompted the president’s impeachment by the Democratic-led House. He was acquitted by the Republican-led Senate. At points when Biden seemed to fade, Trump shifted to Sanders, who had strong showings in the first contests of the Democratic primary and was briefly the front-runner. Trump repeatedly blasted Sanders and told audiences at his rallies that the U.S. would never be a socialist country, a reference to the Vermont senator’s embrace of democratic socialism. But after Biden’s campaign rebounded late last month in South Carolina and posted resounding wins in many of the March contests, he’s again the subject of the president’s attention.  Trump has turned a recitation of Biden gaffes into a running gag line at his political events and fundraisers.  “There’s something going on there,” Trump, 73, told Fox News in a town hall last week. Biden’s verbal stumbles have been a focus of Republicans as they seek to rebrand the famously off-the-cuff former vice president, who made Dairy Queen stops between official events while serving in the White House, as more of a “career politician” than his everyman reputation would suggest. They note his record in Washington is even longer than Clinton’s was, and that on substantive issues, like trade, Biden supported deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. For the last month, Trump’s campaign has been sowing intrigue over the Democratic Party’s swift coalescing around Biden at the expense of Sanders, trying to reignite anger over the Vermont senator’s treatment by the Democratic Party in 2016. In a statement late Tuesday, Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said it was “clear that the Democrat establishment has rallied around the confused Joe Biden in an effort to deny the nomination to Bernie Sanders.” Trump has echoed the notion in tweets, claiming without evidence that Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, “working in conjunction” with the party, sunk Sanders’ campaign when she waited until after Super Tuesday to get out of the race. Trump’s campaign acknowledges that there are “loud echoes” of the anti-Clinton effort as the 2020 focus zeroes in on Biden. It plans a multifaceted effort to drive up Biden’s negative ratings by exploiting the Sanders discontent and by stoking questions about Biden’s fitness for the job and his son’s business record. Biden and his aides have looked to past campaigns for reminders of the danger of being defined early by opponents. Clinton never outran the attention to her use of a private email server as secretary of state and questions about the activities of the Clinton Foundation. John Kerry’s 2004 presidential campaign similarly fell short when a group of Vietnam veterans questioned his war valor, despite military records backing up his litany of medals.  In both cases, the Democratic nominees did not immediately react to the onslaught, eventually drawing critiques even from supporters that they let their attackers sway public opinion too much. Biden’s inner circle plans to take a different, more aggressive course.  Immediately following the release of a White House whistleblower’s report that became the foundation of the House impeachment case against Trump, Biden himself went on the offensive.  “Vladimir Putin doesn’t want me to be president … and Donald Trump doesn’t want me to be the Democratic nominee because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum,” Biden began telling his campaign audiences.  Biden often notes that he’s released decades of his tax returns and tauntingly dares Trump to do the same. Biden called an Iowa voter who questioned his defense of his son “a damn liar,” and he’s repeatedly admonished reporters to “ask the right questions.”  His aides have similarly pressed the media not to simply fact check Trump, but to also actively debunk falsehoods from the president and his allies. Biden’s campaign believes their biggest advantage over Trump’s attacks is the former vice president’s likability. As he’s consolidated support from Democratic lawmakers and other power brokers, his backers often say they’re endorsing Biden because “we know Joe.” “He’s been known for decades as someone who is true to himself and speaks his mind,” said Andrew Bates, who runs Biden’s rapid response operation. “This is not some over-calculating politician.”  “On balance,” Bates said, “that becomes an enormous strength.” ___ Barrow reported from Atlanta. ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.”","Trump, GOP allies move quickly to discredit, attack Biden ",2020-03-11T21:35:37Z,https://apnews.com/1a37f56750775c25f18414c1c1ab8ed2,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) —  A Republican-led Senate committee has postponed a subpoena vote as part of its investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, though the chairman of the panel says the probe related to the Democratic presidential front-runner will move forward.  The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee scrapped a vote Wednesday on a subpoena to interview and obtain documents from a witness in the panel’s probe of Burisma, a gas company in Ukraine that paid Hunter Biden to serve as a board member. The subject of the subpoena, Andrii Telizhenko, was a consultant to a lobbying firm that worked with Burisma.  In a note to committee members, Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said the committee will instead subpoena the lobbying firm, Blue Star Strategies, directly to obtain the documents.  There is no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens, and Hunter Biden has denied using his influence with his father to aid Burisma. But Republicans coming to President Donald Trump’s defense during and after last year’s impeachment trial have encouraged investigations of Hunter Biden’s activities, questioning whether they created a conflict of interest for Joe Biden as the former vice president worked on Ukraine policy in the Obama administration. Democrats say the investigations are politically motivated and designed to hurt Biden in his presidential run. In the note to members before the scheduled vote, Johnson said there had been bipartisan meetings on the subject and the vote on the Telizhenko subpoena would be postponed “out of an abundance of caution, and to allow time for you to receive additional briefings.”  At the meeting that had been previously scheduled to consider the subpoena, Johnson told members that the panel will still be moving forward with the investigation, but “in this setting, the less said the better ... in this setting, I’d rather not get into it.”  As Democrats have criticized the probe, Johnson has insisted his committee’s investigation is not political. He said last month that “the American people have a right to know how their government officials conducted official business, whether certain parties received special treatment, and whether any apparent or actual conflict of interest unduly influenced U.S. policy.”  Johnson pointed to letters he wrote the top Democrat on the panel, Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, in February on his intent to pursue the probe, which was before Biden won several states on Super Tuesday and revived his candidacy. Trump, though, has been clear about his intentions. Asked about investigations into the Bidens on Fox News last week, Trump said it will be a “major issue” in the campaign. “I will bring that up all the time,” he said. Trump’s efforts to have Ukraine investigate Hunter Biden’s role as a board member for Burisma were at the heart of House Democrats’ impeachment probe last year. He asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate the Bidens on a July phone call that was revealed by a whistleblower’s complaint last fall.  The House impeached Trump in December for pressuring the Ukrainian government while withholding military aid to the country. The Senate acquitted him in February.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Wednesday said it would allow the Trump administration to continue enforcing a policy that makes asylum-seekers wait in Mexico for U.S. court hearings, despite lower court rulings that the policy probably is illegal. The justices’ order, over a dissenting vote by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, overturns a lower court order that would have blocked the policy, at least for people arriving at the border crossings in Arizona and California. The lower court order was to have taken effect on Thursday. Instead, the “Remain in Mexico” policy will remain in force while a lawsuit challenging it plays out in the courts, probably at least through the end of President Donald Trump’s term in January. The next step for the administration is to file a formal appeal with the Supreme Court. But the justices may not even consider the appeal until the fall and, if the case is granted full review, arguments would not be held until early 2021. The high court action is the latest instance of the justices siding with the administration to allow Trump’s immigration policies to continue after lower courts had moved to halt them. Other cases include the travel ban on visitors from some largely Muslim countries, construction of the border wall, and the “wealth test” for people seeking green cards. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco has ruled that the asylum policy, known officially as “Migrant Protection Protocols,” probably is illegal under U.S. law to prevent sending people to countries where their lives or freedom would be threatened because of their race, religion, nationality, political beliefs or membership in a particular social group. About 60,000 asylum-seekers have been returned to Mexico to wait for their cases to wind through clogged U.S. immigration courts since the policy was introduced in January 2019 in San Diego and later expanded across the border. “The Court of Appeals unequivocally declared this policy to be illegal. The Supreme Court should as well,″ said Judy Rabinovitz, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who represents asylum-seekers and immigrant advocacy groups in the case. “Asylum-seekers face grave danger and irreversible harm every day this depraved policy remains in effect.” The Justice Department said the high court’s order restores “the government’s ability to manage the Southwest border and to work cooperatively with the Mexican government to address illegal immigration.” Human Rights First, an advocacy group that opposes the policy, said it found more than 1,000 public reports of kidnappings, torture, rape and assaults of asylum-seekers returned to Mexico. The administration said in court papers that more than 36,000 of the 60,000 cases had been resolved in immigration courts. Asylum has been granted in less than 1% of the cases that have been decided. Only 5% are represented by attorneys, many of whom are reluctant to visit clients in Mexico. The administration had argued that thousands of immigrants would rush the border if the high court didn’t step in.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Associated Press surveyed voters in three of the six states that held Democratic presidential contests on Tuesday. Here’s a snapshot of voters in Michigan, Missouri and Mississippi — who they are and what matters to them — based on preliminary results from AP VoteCast, conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.  MICHIGAN  Part of the “blue wall” that flipped to Donald Trump in 2016, Michigan is a top general election battleground — and was a major test for both former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders. Both men were hoping the results would prove they were best poised to fire up the Democrats that may decide the election in November. Biden came out victorious. Biden assembled his now-familiar coalition. He won older voters, moderates and women. He showed strength with working-class voters. About 60% of voters in Michigan did not have a college degree, and Biden won the majority of them. He appeared to carry that advantage across race and gender, in the suburbs and cities.  Sanders, meanwhile, failed to expand his coalition or boost turnout among the young people who have powered his campaign. Thirty-seven percent of Michigan voters were under 45. In California and Colorado, states Sanders won last week, the share of those voters was about 45%.  For all Biden’s strength, enthusiasm for his bid wasn’t overwhelming. Biden’s supporters were less likely to say they were very enthusiastic than Sanders’, 45% to 60%. And a significant slice of Democratic voters in Michigan — 19% — said their decision on how to vote in November will depend on who is nominated as the Democratic candidate. A wide majority — roughly three-quarters — said they think the economic system in this country is unfair. That includes about a third describing it as “very unfair.” Among Michigan voters, Biden was considered the candidate best poised to handle the economy. New absentee voting rules triggered a surge in early voting in Michigan. AP VoteCast isn’t based on in-person interviews conducted on election days; rather, it’s a survey designed to capture opinions regardless of how and when voters choose to cast their ballot. MISSOURI With the race narrowed to two major candidates, voters’ views about electability came into sharp focus. In Missouri, a Republican-leaning state, Democratic primary voters were more confident in Biden’s chances of beating Trump than Sanders’. That might have helped the former vice president emerge victorious on Tuesday. The Associated Press called Biden the winner when polls closed. About 40% think Biden definitely could beat Trump, and roughly another 40% say he probably could.  But just about a quarter say Sanders definitely could defeat Trump in November, with about 40% saying he probably could. Biden bested Sanders among men and women, college graduates and those without a degree, and white and African American voters. He enjoyed a significant advantage among older voters, while Sanders maintained his edge among voters under 45. Moderates and conservatives lined up solidly behind Biden. While Sanders appeared to lead among liberal voters, many of them — 43% — supported Biden.  Health care, an issue that has intensely divided the field of Democratic candidates this cycle, was named the most important issue facing the country by close to half of primary voters in Missouri. Roughly 2 in 10 considered climate change the top priority, while about 1 in 10 said that of the economy. Voters divided about evenly over whether Sanders or Biden would be best able to handle health care as president. But on issues related to race, Biden had an advantage over Sanders as the most capable candidate. MISSISSIPPI A majority of Democratic primary voters in Mississippi were African American, and Biden won them 86% to Sanders’ 11%. Biden also led among white voters, across age groups, education levels and ideologies. He was called the winner by The Associated Press. Mississippi voters wanted a nominee that cares about people like them. Voters there ranked that as as big a priority as selecting a candidate who can beat Trump and exhibit strong leadership. About 9 in 10 primary voters in Mississippi said each of the three qualities was very important in a Democratic nominee, and Biden overwhelmingly won the support of those voters.  Health care was named the most important issue by 40% of voters, but 24% pointed to the economy. About 30% of voters overall described their families as “falling behind” financially, compared with 60% who said they are holding steady and just about 10% “getting ahead.”  Biden was thought to be the candidate best able to handle health care, as well as issues related to race. About two-thirds of Mississippi voters expressed support for government-paid reparations to African Americans for slavery and racial discrimination, but there was a significant divide by race. About 75% of black voters expressed support, compared with about 40% of white voters. ____ AP VoteCast is a survey of the American electorate conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago for The Associated Press and Fox News.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — Joe Biden went into Tuesday’s primaries riding a wave of voter confidence about his chances of victory in November — and that propelled him to wins in Michigan, Missouri and Mississippi.  Democratic primary voters in those states were more likely to think the former vice president could defeat President Donald Trump in the general election, compared with Biden’s top rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, according to AP VoteCast surveys of voters. The Associated Press also called Biden the winner in Idaho. Sanders won the caucuses in North Dakota. Washington remains too early to call. The surveys showed Biden built a coalition that crossed the spectrum of Democrats in Michigan, Missouri and Mississippi. African Americans and older voters continued to be a reliable foundation of support for Biden. He also drew support from blue-collar workers, rural voters, city dwellers, women, the highly educated, moderates, conservatives and even the “somewhat liberal,” according to AP VoteCast.  Sanders, meanwhile, preserved his strength with voters younger than 30 and those who consider themselves “very liberal.” But he failed in his push to drive up turnout among those groups and couldn’t overcome the concerns of moderate and conservative Democrats who are focused first and foremost on expelling Trump from the White House. AP VoteCast surveys are designed to capture voters’ views regardless of when or how they voted, accounting for the many voters in Michigan and other states who voted early. Here’s a look at voters’ opinions as they cast their ballots in half of the six contests on Tuesday.  ELECTABILITY  Voters generally view Biden as the better match against Trump. About 80% in Michigan and Missouri believe Biden could beat the incumbent, while roughly 90% in Mississippi feel that way. Just about 60% of voters in Missouri and Mississippi, and 65% of voters in Michigan, think Sanders would be likely to defeat the incumbent president.  Still, there is some notable indecision among primary voters about whom they’ll cast a ballot for in November. Roughly 80% in each state say they will definitely vote for the Democratic candidate against Trump no matter who is nominated. But close to 20% say their decision depends on which candidate becomes the nominee.  In Michigan, a state that flipped Republican in 2016, those undecided voters looked more like potential Trump voters than liberals unhappy with the prospect of a Biden nomination. Among voters saying their November decision depends on the nominee, 22% describe themselves as conservative and 51% say they are moderate. That’s largely true in Republican-leaning Missouri as well. WHO IS VOTING? In the Democratic presidential contests, it’s all about what women want. About 60% of Democratic primary voters in Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi were women. This fits a pattern in most states where a firm majority of voters are women. This has helped boost Biden, who has beaten Sanders among women voters.  Other key Democratic demographics showed up for Biden on Tuesday. In Mississippi, about 70% of voters were African American, and Biden won 86% of their votes, compared with Sanders’ 11%.  About 70% of Mississippi voters, and roughly 60% of Michigan and Missouri voters, described themselves as moderate or conservative, another base of Biden support.  THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS Sanders still gets love from voters under 30, but he has not delivered on his strategy of getting them to the polls. He won 72% of this group in Missouri and 69% in Michigan. But the under-30 crowd was just 14% of voters in both states — about the same share as in previous primaries contests. In other bad news for Sanders, he showed no overwhelming strength with voters age 30 to 44, typically a larger share of the vote than the very young.  In all three states, older voters dominated. About 60% of voters were 45 and older, a group Biden has won over handily.  BLUE COLLAR LOYALTIES Both Biden and Sanders have claimed to be the working-class candidate. On Tuesday, Biden assembled a coalition that could back him up. About 60% of voters in Missouri and Michigan don’t have a college degree, and Biden won 61% of their votes in Missouri and 54% in Michigan. At least 40% of voters earn less than $50,000; Biden won at least half of their votes.  Biden’s strength among voters without a college degree appeared to cross race and gender, suburbs and cities. Only young people defied the trend. Sanders beat Biden with voters under 45 who don’t have a college degree. YOU SAY YOU WANT A REVOLUTION Voters in New Hampshire and Iowa wanted to change the U.S. political system. That turned out to be an outlier as the nomination battle spread to other states.  In the opening two contests, about two-thirds of voters wanted a Democratic nominee who would transform the government, compared with roughly a third who would rather return to a time before Trump. But as Biden climbed to the pole position, the answers to this question have shifted. Voters on Tuesday were about evenly split on the question of change versus restoration, or even leaned more toward a restoration of the way things were, as in Mississippi. WHERE IS THE ENTHUSIASM?  Even if Democratic primary voters like their odds in November, enthusiasm isn’t overwhelming. Just about half of voters in Michigan and Missouri and roughly two-thirds in Mississippi say they are very enthusiastic about the candidate they are supporting in the primary. In all three states, roughly a third are somewhat enthusiastic. As many as 1 in 10 expressed little to no enthusiasm. In Missouri and Michigan, Sanders’ supporters are more enthusiastic than Biden’s. At least 60% of Sanders’ voters said they were very enthusiastic about supporting their candidate, compared with no more than half of Biden’s supporters saying the same.  TOP ISSUES  Despite fears that the coronavirus could stop the longest economic expansion in U.S. history, there does not yet appear to be a spike in voters’ concern about the economy. Just about 1 in 10 voters in Missouri said the economy was the most important. Only 17% in Michigan described the economy and jobs as most critical, roughly comparable to the share saying that of climate change.  In Mississippi, where a majority of voters were African American, about a quarter viewed the economy as the top issue. That’s about the same share as in Alabama, which voted last week.  Health care was the top issue for voters in all three states, as it has been in other Democratic presidential contests. Close to half of voters in Missouri, and about 40% of voters in Michigan and Mississippi, name health care the top priority.  UNFAIR ECONOMY  Still, economic inequality is a key concern for Democrats.  Roughly three-quarters of voters in each state consider the economic system in this country to be unfair, similar to Democratic voters in contests earlier this year. Many — a third or more — call the system “very unfair.”  About a quarter of voters said they were “falling behind” financially, while majorities felt they were holding steady. Roughly half of voters in Michigan, and about 60% of voters in Missouri and Mississippi, who are “falling behind” called the system highly unfair.  ____ AP VoteCast is a survey of the American electorate conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago for The Associated Press and Fox News.

"DETROIT (AP) — The Latest on the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries (all times local): 7:55 a.m. Bernie Sanders has won North Dakota’s Democratic presidential caucuses. Participation in Tuesday’s contest was expected to be dramatically higher than it was four years ago. That’s mainly due to a procedural change that makes the caucuses function more like a traditional election, with citizens able to drop in at 14 caucus sites to cast their ballot and leave.  Sanders won the state’s Democratic caucuses over Hillary Clinton in 2016 by nearly 40 percentage points. The race between Joe Biden and Sanders was upended by the former vice president’s Super Tuesday turnaround. But neither campaign focused closely on North Dakota. The state offers 14 pledged delegates. Biden won primaries in Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri and Idaho on Tuesday. ___ 1:01 a.m. Joe Biden has won Idaho’s Democratic presidential primary. The state has 20 pledged delegates at stake. Democrats in Idaho are using a primary for the first time. They used a caucus in 2016 to pick Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nominee. Officials have said switching to a Democratic primary this year from a caucus could significantly increase the number of participants and play a role in the outcome. President Donald Trump is expected to have little difficulty winning the state in the November general election.  Idaho last year was the nation’s fastest-growing state, with close to 37,000 new residents boosting its population to nearly 1.8 million. That’s a 2.1% population increase. Biden also won primaries Tuesday in Michigan, Missouri and Minnesota. ___ 11:35 p.m. The Democratic presidential primary in Washington state is too early to call. All votes in Washington state are cast by mail or by dropping them off in a ballot box, and the state counts a significant amount on the day of the election. But once that first update is released, election officials only provide an update once a day until all the late-arriving ballots are counted. In the first batch of results released late Tuesday night, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden are essentially tied — with each claiming about 33% of the roughly 1 million counted votes. Most counties in Washington state will next provide an update about their results Wednesday. ___ 11 p.m. Joe Biden is celebrating victories in Democratic presidential primaries in Mississippi, Missouri and especially the general election battleground of Michigan. During an appearance near his Philadelphia campaign headquarters, the former vice president called Tuesday’s vote “another good night” and “a step closer to restoring decency, dignity and honor to the White House.” In a subdued tone, Biden reached out to supporters of struggling rival Bernie Sanders, thanking the Vermont senator and his following “for their tireless energy and their passion” and their common goal: to “beat Donald Trump.” Biden reminded his supporters — and a national television audience — of the former rivals who have endorsed him, more recently California Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, saying: “We’re bringing this party together. That’s what we have to do.” ___ 10:50 p.m. Joe Biden says the coronavirus crisis is “a matter of presidential leadership” and he’ll soon propose a plan to combat it. The former vice president spoke after he won Democratic primaries in Michigan, Missouri and Mississippi on Tuesday, dealing a serious blow to Bernie Sanders. But Biden opened his victory speech with an acknowledgement of the worldwide crisis that has prompted travel bans, quarantines and emptied college campuses. He said, “This whole coronavirus issue is a matter of presidential leadership, and later this week I’ll be speaking to you on what I believe the nation should be doing to address this virus.” The outbreak is disrupting the Democratic primary, too. Both Biden and Sanders cancelled rallies Tuesday night. And the Democratic National Committee says their next debate, Sunday in Arizona, will not have a live audience. ___ 9:50 p.m. Tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang is backing Joe Biden’s presidential bid, saying it’s time for Democrats to rally around the former vice president and get ready for the general election. Following Biden’s projected wins in a number of state primaries Tuesday, Yang said on CNN that he sees Biden as the best-positioned candidate to defeat President Donald Trump in November, saying Democrats need to “come together as a party, starting tonight.” A supporter of Bernie Sanders in 2016, Yang said the Vermont senator inspired his own presidential run, which Yang ended in February before signing on as a CNN political commentator. Yang said he believes the progressive ideas expressed by candidates like Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and himself “will have a voice in the Biden administration to start solving these problems.” ___ 9:25 p.m. The Associated Press declared Joe Biden the winner of Michigan’s Democratic presidential primary Tuesday using a combination of early vote returns and its AP VoteCast survey of voters in the state. Michigan stretches across two time zones, which means there’s an hour in which officials in most of the state are counting votes as a few counties in the state’s Upper Peninsula are still casting ballots. The AP called the race just a few minutes after polls closed at 9 p.m. ET in Michigan, after that first hour of results showed Biden ahead of Bernie Sanders. Those early returns also matched the results of AP VoteCast, the news agency’s wide-ranging survey of the American electorate. VoteCast showed Biden holding a solid lead over Bernie Sanders in Michigan’s Democratic primary. The poll showed Biden winning among men and women, as well as white voters and African Americans. More Democratic primary voters thought he, rather than Sanders, is more likely to beat Donald Trump come November. AP VoteCast is conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago for The Associated Press and Fox News. ___ 9:05 p.m. Joe Biden has won Michigan’s Democratic presidential primary. Michigan was the largest of the six states voting Tuesday, with 125 pledged delegates at stake. Biden emphasized the Obama administration’s bailout of the auto industry, which saved thousands of jobs. He also counted on continued strong support among African American voters. Sanders defeated Hillary Clinton in Michigan’s 2016 Democratic presidential primary. Losing the state this year may greatly diminish his chances at the nomination. Many voters are already looking ahead to November and whether President Donald Trump can again win in the state that, perhaps more than any other, catapulted him into the White House in 2016.  ___ 8:05 p.m. As soon as polls closed in Mississippi and Missouri at 8 p.m. Eastern Time, The Associated Press declared Joe Biden the winner in both states’ Democratic presidential primary.  The AP called Biden the winner over Bernie Sanders even though state officials had yet to release any results from Tuesday’s election. The news agency did so based on results from AP VoteCast, its wide-ranging survey of the American electorate. That election research captures the views of voters on whom they vote for, and why.  The VoteCast survey showed Biden with a wide lead in both states. Importantly, Biden was leading in all parts of both states. He led among both men and women, as well as among both white voters and African American voters. Black voters have powered Biden to wins in several states to date in the Democratic primaries, including his touchstone victory in South Carolina late last month.  In both Mississippi and Missouri on Tuesday, Biden dominated among African Americans — winning the support of close to three-quarters of African Americans in both states.  Democratic primary voters in Missouri and Mississippi were more likely to think Biden rather than Sanders could defeat Donald Trump in November.  AP VoteCast is conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago for The Associated Press and Fox News.  ___ 8 p.m. Joe Biden has won the Democratic presidential primaries in Missouri and Mississippi. Missouri has 68 delegates at stake. Mississippi has 36 pledged delegates at stake. Missouri is among the more conservative of the six states holding Democratic primaries Tuesday. All but one of the statewide elected officials are Republicans. The Democratic presidential candidate faces an uphill battle to carry Missouri in November against President Donald Trump, who won the state by 19 percentage points in 2016. Joe Biden campaigned in Mississippi on Sunday, working to shore up support among African Americans, who make up 38% of Mississippi’s population and an even larger share of the Democratic electorate. Bernie Sanders canceled a plan to appear Friday in Jackson so he could campaign in Michigan, which is also holding a primary Tuesday.  ___ 8 p.m. Polls are beginning to close as six states hold primaries or caucuses to help determine the Democratic presidential nominee who will go up against President Donald Trump in November. Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington state are voting Tuesday. Polls closed in Mississippi and Missouri at 8 p.m. Eastern. Former Vice President Joe Biden took the lead over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the delegate count after last week’s Super Tuesday, when 14 states and American Samoa voted. Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard is the only other Democratic candidate remaining in the race. It’s a critical point in the Democratic race. Biden is looking to cement his front-runner status, while Sanders is in an urgent fight to turn things around. The primary calendar is quickly shifting to states that could favor Biden and narrow his path to the nomination. ___ 7:20 p.m. Democratic front-runners Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders will debate as scheduled Sunday in Arizona amid the coronavirus outbreak — but without a live audience. The Democratic National Committee says it is making the move “at the request of both campaigns and out of an abundance of caution.” DNC Communications Director Xochitl Hinojosa says local public health officials had advised that the debate could continue as planned. Both Biden and Sanders cancelled their election night events Tuesday in Ohio amid concerns about the epidemic. ___ 4:25 p.m. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is canceling a scheduled rally in Cleveland amid concerns over the spread of the new coronavirus.  Mike Casca, a spokesman for the 78-year-old Vermont senator, says the campaign is canceling the event “Out of concern for public health and safety.” Sanders had been set to speak there as results from Democratic primary voting taking place in six states rolled in Tuesday night. “We are heeding the public warnings from Ohio state officials, who have communicated concern about holding large, indoor events during the coronavirus outbreak,” Casca said. “Sen. Sanders would like to express his regret to the thousands of Ohioans who had planned to attend the event tonight.” Joe Biden is scheduled to hold his own rally in Cleveland later Tuesday. A spokesman for the 77-year-old former vice president indicated there was no cancellation coming, saying, “We’re headed to Cleveland.” ___ 2:20 p.m. Bernie Sanders is picking up the endorsement of a U.S. House member who backed Hillary Clinton in 2016 and praises the Vermont senator for leadership on issues affecting veterans and working families. Rep. Mark Takano of California says in a video out Tuesday from the Sanders campaign that he’s supporting him in part because of Sanders’ “ability to get things done.” Takano, who currently chairs the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, cites Sanders’ previous leadership on the Senate counterpart body. His backing is the first for Sanders from a member of Congress in several weeks, while former Vice President Joe Biden has rolled out nearly 50 congressional endorsements this month alone. Takano represents California, a delegate-rich prize that Sanders carried in last week’s Super Tuesday primaries. On Tuesday, six more states hold Democratic presidential primaries.  In the video, Takano — the first openly gay person of color elected to Congress — lauds Sanders’ early support for marriage equality, as well as his focus on issues including climate change and entitlement protections.  ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.”",The Latest: Sanders wins North Dakota caucuses,2020-03-10T14:59:29Z,https://apnews.com/1fb4ebe120cca2d5f93305f5425de023,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — Joe Biden’s path to the Democratic presidential nomination widened significantly Tuesday with commanding victories in Mississippi, Missouri and Michigan, a state that his rival Bernie Sanders won four years ago. Key takeaways: IT’S BIDEN’S NOMINATION TO LOSE  Biden has become the reliable Buick of this race. His momentum accelerated as he broadened his delegate lead over Sanders with a series of decisive victories. The former vice president’s solid win in Michigan came in a state Sanders was depending on both to bolster his case going forward and for the practical delegate math involved. He came into the day about 96 delegates behind Biden, and Michigan was his best shot at preventing that lead from getting any wider. (Democrats require 1,991 delegates for nomination.)  As it is, Sanders lost a big state where his upset of Hillary Clinton four years ago gave him reason to continue his presidential bid through the end the nominating calendar in June. This time, the first round of voting after Super Tuesday ended the same way as last week’s surprise outcome: with a Biden celebration and an increasingly steep climb for Sanders. Biden isn’t just leaning on his base of African Americans. AP VoteCast surveys in Michigan and Missouri also show he topped Sanders in suburbs and, notably, across small-town and rural counties, where Sanders had led Clinton in 2016.  “We need you, we want you, and there’s a place in our campaign for each of you,” Biden said Tuesday night. “I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion. We share a common goal, and together we’ll beat Donald Trump.” Sanders’ bad March can be explained this way: Biden’s net delegate gains out of Alabama last week and Mississippi on Tuesday — two Republican-dominated states — essentially cancel out the delegate advantage that Sanders pulled out of California, which has the largest delegate trove.  DOES BERNIE HAVE A PATH OR A PROTEST? Sanders stayed in the race until June four years ago, fueled in no small part by his Michigan primary victory. This time, the path going forward looks much different.  The Vermont senator faces a fraught choice. Does he try something new: going after Biden even more aggressively as an establishment figure, a relative foreign policy hawk, a budget centrist who threatens Social Security? There’s little evidence over the last two weeks that any of that would change the fundamentals of the contest. Another option: Sanders can continue advocating for the issues that his supporters hold dear, like “Medicare for All” and free college, not explicitly ceding the nomination but using his base to pressure a Biden-led party to move as far left as possible. He was back at his home in Vermont Tuesday night. BLACK VOTE AGAIN PROVES UNATTAINABLE FOR SANDERS It can’t be emphasized enough. Black voters are as crucial for picking Democratic nominees as any demographic in the party’s coalition. And Sanders just can’t get over the hump. It happened again in Mississippi on Tuesday, just like Southern Super Tuesday states last week and South Carolina before that. According to AP VoteCast, about 70% of Mississippi’s Democratic primary voters were African American; 86% of them supported Biden. The reality remains: Sanders has not made enough inroads in that critical Democratic constituency to have a clear path to becoming the nominee. BIDEN HAS AN EDGE ON SANDERS’ BIGGEST ISSUE Sanders has made universal health care his main policy focus. But when it comes to whom people trust on health care, voters on Tuesday were somewhat more comfortable with Biden. When asked who would best be able to handle health care as president, 41% of Michigan voters said they preferred Biden, according to AP VoteCast. Just 31% liked Sanders. Biden also led on health care in Mississippi, while Missouri was evenly split between both of them. CORONAVIRUS CURVEBALL Biden and Sanders cancelled campaign rallies because of the spread of coronavirus, a rare example of an external event bringing a presidential race to a temporary halt. Both men had planned to address supporters Tuesday night at watch parties, but cited public health warnings. And their plans going forward are up in the air.  Their debate scheduled for Sunday in Arizona is still on, but will not have an audience as previously planned. That likely affects Sanders more, since the Vermont senator, much like President Donald Trump, campaigns as a populist who addresses large rallies with thousands of supporters. But Biden has just started to draw large crowds as well.  At the least, Biden and Sanders now have plenty of money to continue television and social media advertising in coming primary states. They will need it for a lineup of states that includes Illinois, Ohio, Florida and Arizona.

"MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — President Donald Trump on Tuesday night spurned his former Attorney General Jeff Sessions to endorse former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville in the U.S. Senate race in Alabama.  Trump announced his support for Tuberville in a tweet. “He will be a great Senator for the people of Alabama. Coach Tommy Tuberville, a winner, has my Complete and Total Endorsement. I love Alabama!” Trump wrote. Trump did not mention Sessions in the tweet.  Tuberville and Sessions are competing in the March 31 Republican primary runoff. The winner will face Democratic Sen. Doug Jones, the current incumbent, in November.  Sessions is seeking a return to the Senate seat he held safely for 20 years before stepping down to become Trump’s first attorney general. Sessions resigned as attorney general after their relationship soured over his recusal in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Sessions said he was bound by Department of Justice regulation to resign because he played a role in Trump’s 2016 campaign.  “Looking forward to helping you drain the swamp and (Keep America Great)” Tuberville responded to Trump in a tweet.  Sessions posted in a tweet that Trump can of course endorse anyone he chooses in the race, but the decision in the Senate race ultimately belongs to voters. Sessions said that even before Trump ran for president, “I fought for the principles that Donald Trump so effectively advocated.” “I believed in those principles then, I have always fought for them, and I will continue to do so,” Sessions wrote.  Sessions and Tuberville were the top two vote-getters in last week’s GOP primary, but were forced into a required runoff after failing to capture over 50 percent of the vote.  Trump’s endorsement of Tuberville came a week after he appeared to mock Sessions for being forced into a runoff. “This is what happens to someone who loyally gets appointed Attorney General of the United States & then doesn’t have the wisdom or courage to stare down & end the phony Russia Witch Hunt,” Trump tweeted last week.  Both Sessions and Tuberville have emphasized their loyalty to Trump, and his legislative agenda, as they compete in the GOP primary. Sessions, who remains a Trump loyalist, has noted that he was the first U.S. senator to endorse Trump and had championed issues such as immigration and trade, even before Trump came to office  “We have this opportunity to turn the Trump agenda into reality, and I am the man for that job,” Sessions said last week at his election night celebration  Tuberville, boosted by name recognition from years as a football coach at Auburn University, has positioned himself as a political outsider and tried to capitalize on Trump’s past criticisms of Sessions.  “We are going to finish what President Trump started when he looked at Jeff Sessions from across the table and said ‘You’re fired.’” Tuberville told supporters last week.

"BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) — Bernie Sanders is vowing to press ahead with his presidential campaign at least long enough to debate Joe Biden this weekend, even while acknowledging his deficit in the Democratic race may be insurmountable. The Vermont senator on Wednesday offered no further details on what his campaign may look like before or after he and Biden — the last two major candidates vying for the Democratic presidential nomination — spar Sunday night on stage in Arizona. The only thing on Sanders’ public schedule was taping an appearance on Wednesday’s “Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.”  And that will continue to raise questions — as unlikely as it may seem less than two weeks after losing his once-commanding front-runner status — about how long Sanders will persist against increasingly daunting odds, especially as the pressure within his own party increases exponentially.  Sanders addressed reporters in Burlington after offering no public statements Tuesday night, when he suffered a devastating defeat in Michigan and losses in Missouri, Idaho and Mississippi. Sanders noted that he won North Dakota and that the continuing count in Washington state remained close — but admitted he was trailing badly in the race to secure enough delegates to clinch the nomination before the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee.  “While our campaign has won the ideological debate, we are losing the debate over electability,” Sanders said, meaning Democrats think Biden has a better chance of beating President Donald Trump in the fall. “That is what millions of Democrats and independents today believe.”  He was quick to add that he thinks he’s the stronger choice, and that he could show that during Sunday’s debate. Sanders promised to press Biden for answers about millions of Americans who don’t have health insurance, a criminal justice system he said unfairly targets and punishes minorities and raising the federal minimum wage.  After that, though, Democrats’ desperate desire to defeat Trump could affect his calculus. Should Sanders get out soon, he could save Democrats months of a messy and expensive primary fight. But an early departure would also deprive the party’s most passionate supporters, including many young people, of the one man who embodies the dramatic change they crave.  Sanders also noted that he was winning a greater percentage of young voters while Biden continues to run up the score with older ones. “Today, I say to the Democratic establishment, in order to win in the future, you need to win the voters who represent the future of our country,” Sanders said. “And you must speak to the issues of concern to them. You cannot simply be satisfied by winning the votes of people who are older.” Sanders has indeed been widely favored over Biden by voters under 30, but he has not delivered on his strategy of getting them to the polls in great numbers, according to AP VoteCast surveys of voters in Tuesday’s Democratic primaries. Also problematic for him: Sanders showed no overwhelming strength with voters age 30 to 44, typically a larger share of the vote than the young, in Michigan and Missouri. Sanders’ mathematical path to winning enough delegates for the nomination is rapidly disappearing. Sanders now needs 57% of the delegates not won so far to get to 1991, the magic number to win the nomination. Both delegate allocation math and voting history show how unlikely it is for Sanders to hit that goal and overtake Biden. That Sanders was vowing to soldier on was hardly a surprise. The 78-year-old democratic socialist is nothing if not willing to take on the political establishment against all odds — and Sanders’ closest allies are happy to see him stay in the race, even if the rest of the party is not.  “The process of unity isn’t just this pie-in-the-sky, vague, butterflies-in-your-tummy type of feeling,” New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of Sanders’ highest-profile supporters, said Wednesday in an interview on Capitol Hill. “It requires real coalition building, and coalition building requires plans and commitments to electorates to figure out how we unify. And so I think that this is a good opportunity for us to come together.” RoseAnn DeMoro, former executive director of National Nurses United and a Sanders confidant, said Sanders “has a mandate not to abandon the movement.”  “Heroes aren’t made, they’re cornered,” DeMoro said. “He is cornered.” Four years ago, under similar pressure in a primary match-up against Hillary Clinton, Sanders fought on for months before ultimately backing Clinton in July. Sanders has repeatedly insisted that he and Biden are friends and that he will back the former vice president if he’s the party’s nominee — he just may not be ready to yet follow through on that promise.  Still, Sanders didn’t say Wednesday where he plans to travel next. His campaign is opening five offices in Arizona on Wednesday night, using top supporters rather than the candidate himself.  Adding to the uncertainty is the spread of coronavirus, which forced both Sanders and Biden to cancel campaign events Tuesday night in Cleveland and prompted Sanders’ team to say it would evaluate future events on a case-by-case basis. Beyond the debate, the primary calendar could get even bleaker for Sanders. Next week, four more states vote and while he is hoping his support with Hispanic voters can lift him in Arizona, Sanders may struggle in two of the most important ones, Illinois and Florida — where some voters could be alienated by his recent comments defending Fidel Castro’s communist government in Cuba.  “Trump must be defeated, and I will do everything in my power to make sure that happens,” Sanders said. “On Sunday night, in the first one-on-one debate of this campaign, the American people will have the opportunity to see which candidate is best positioned to accomplish that.”  ___ Peoples reported from Philadelphia.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — Taking dramatic action, President Donald Trump announced he is sharply restricting passenger travel from 26 European nations to the U.S. and moving to ease the economic cost of a viral pandemic that is roiling global financial markets and disrupting the daily lives of Americans.  Trump, in a rare Oval Office address to the nation, said Wednesday that the monthlong restriction on travel would begin late Friday, at midnight. After days of playing down the coronavirus threat, he blamed Europe for not acting quickly enough to address the “foreign virus” and claimed that U.S. clusters were “seeded” by European travelers. “We made a lifesaving move with early action on China,” Trump said. “Now we must take the same action with Europe.” Trump said the restrictions won’t apply to the United Kingdom and there would be exemptions for “Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings.” He said the U.S. would monitor the situation to determine if travel could be reopened earlier. The State Department followed Trump’s remarks by issuing an extraordinary global health advisory cautioning U.S. citizens to “reconsider travel abroad” due to the virus and associated quarantines and restrictions.  Trump spoke after days of confusion in Washington and in the face of mounting calls on the Republican president to demonstrate greater leadership. At times, though, his remarks contributed to the uncertainty. While Trump said all European travel would be cut off, Homeland Security officials later clarified that the new travel restrictions would apply only to most foreign nationals who have been in the “Schengen Area” at any point for 14 days prior to their scheduled arrival to the United States. The area includes France, Italy, German, Greece, Austria, Belgium and others, and the White House said the zone has the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases outside of mainland China.  The restrictions don’t apply to legal permanent residents, immediate family of U.S. citizens or others “identified in the proclamation” signed by Trump. Vice President Mike Pence said Thursday on ABC’s “Good Morning America” that the Trump administration is also requesting travelers returning to the U.S. from Europe to “voluntarily quarantine” for 14 days. Trump said the prohibitions would “not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things.” But the official proclamation released after Trump spoke made clear it applies to people, not goods and cargo. The Oval Office address represented an abrupt shift in tone from a president who has repeatedly sought to play down the severity of the virus outbreak. Many Americans shared a similar mindset in recent weeks, but the grueling events of Wednesday changed the mood: Communities canceled public events nationwide, universities moved to cancel in-person classes and families grappled with the impact of disruptions to public schools. The number of confirmed cases of the infection topped 1,000 in the U.S., and the World Health Organization declared the global crisis is now a pandemic. Even as Trump spoke from behind the Resolute Desk, the pandemic’s ferocious rewriting of American daily life continued. The National Basketball Association suspended its season, and Oscar-winning actor Tom Hanks announced that he and his wife, Rita Wilson, had tested positive for COVID-19. The first confirmed case on Capitol Hill was reported in a legislative staffer. After Trump spoke, the White House cancelled a planned trip by the president to Nevada and Colorado this week “out of an abundance of caution.” Trump’s reelection campaign also postponed a planned March 19 event in Milwaukee that was set to feature the president. After a week of mixed messages and false starts, and as government officials warned in increasingly urgent terms that the outbreak in the U.S. will only get worse, Washington suddenly seemed poised to act.  Congress unveiled a multibillion-dollar aid package that was expected to be voted on by the House as soon as Thursday. “I can say we will see more cases, and things will get worse than they are right now,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said in testimony before the House Oversight and Reform Committee. He said the virus is “10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu.” S&P 500 futures went from a loss of about 0.4% before Trump spoke to a decline of 1.5% afterwards. The decline in the futures market followed a steep 4.9% drop in regular trading Wednesday. Wall Street investors are increasingly concerned that the Trump administration and other governments won’t be able to do enough to prevent the virus outbreak from causing significant damage to the global economy. After Trump’s address, Defense Secretary Mark Esper announced a series of moves, including restrictions for 60 days on travel by servicemembers, Defense Department civilians and their families to, from and through the four counties currently designated by the Centers for Disease Control as the highest risk COVID-19 counties — China, Iran, South Korea and Italy.  In his remarks, Trump focused more on the threat of travel continuing to bring in illness when, in fact, in parts of the country there already is “community spread” — meaning people who don’t have a known travel exposure are becoming infected.  In an omission that Democratic leaders called “alarming,” Trump left unaddressed the testing backlog that is hampering efforts to learn just how many Americans already are infected. And while he warned the elderly to avoid risky crowds, advised nursing homes to suspend visitors and told sick people to stay home from work, he didn’t address one of the biggest concerns — whether hospitals are equipped to handle the sick or will be overwhelmed. Georgetown University public health expert Lawrence Gostin tweeted in reaction to Trump’s speech, “Most of Europe is as safe as US” and COVID-19 “is already here; germs don’t respect borders.” Trump said he was also directing agencies to provide unspecified financial relief for “for workers who are ill, quarantined or caring for others due to coronavirus,” and asked Congress to take action to extend it. White House aides declined to provide details on Trump’s announcement. Trump said the U.S. will defer tax payments for some individual and business filers for three months to lessen the impacts of the virus outbreak. He said the Small Business Administration will also make low-interest loans available to businesses to help them weather the storm. “This is not a financial crisis,” he said. “This just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome together as a nation and as a world.”  Trump also reiterated his call on Congress to pass a cut to the federal payroll tax in order to stimulate the economy, though that idea has been dismissed by many lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. He remained silent on his previous calls to provide assistance to industries hard-hit by the pandemic like airlines and cruise ships. On Capitol Hill, House Democrats late Wednesday introduced an economic assistance plan that would provide free coronavirus testing nationwide and emergency funding to reimburse lost paychecks for those in self-quarantine, missing work or losing jobs amid the outbreak.  The draft legislation contains a new, temporary federal sick leave benefit for coronavirus victims and caregivers — two-thirds of an employee’s monthly income for up to three months — as well as a permanent mandate for employers to provide up to seven days of sick leave for their workers and 14 days leave in case of public health emergencies.  Facing a likely surge in unemployment claims, the package would also give states money for the newly jobless. It would provide additional funding for food and nutrition benefits for pregnant women, mothers and young children. It also would increase money for “meals on wheels” and food for low-income elderly people, as well as additional Medicaid funding for states facing a fiscal crunch. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, whom Trump tapped to negotiate with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, urged Congress “to pass legislation quickly.” But while the ambitious package should breeze through the House on Thursday, Senate Republicans are likely to seek changes. The administration had floated several other strategies, including the rare idea of declaring a national disaster that could potentially unlock funding streams, according to a person unauthorized to discuss the planning and granted anonymity. But Trump ultimately opted against taking that step Wednesday. Trump, 73, is considered at higher risk because of his age and has repeatedly flouted the advice of public health experts, who have advised the public to stop hand-shaking and practice social distancing. But that didn’t stop him from calling on fellow citizens to help combat the virus’ spread. “For all Americans, it is essential that everyone take extra precautions and practice good hygiene. Each of us has a role to play in defeating this virus,” he said. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.  The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.  Congress’ attending physician told staff there could be 70 million to 100 million coronavirus cases in the U.S. That’s on par with other estimates. A Harvard official has estimated that 20% to 60% of adults will get the virus, noting it’s “a pretty wide range.” In Washington, tourists still arrived at the U.S. Capitol, but an official unauthorized to discuss the situation and speaking on the condition of anonymity confirmed that tours would soon be shut down. ___ Associated Press writers Lauran Neergaard, Martin Crutsinger, Laurie Kellman and Kevin Freking in Washington contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Former U.S. Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy won the Democratic nomination for a U.S. Senate seat in Mississippi on Tuesday, setting up a rematch with Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, an outspoken ally of President Donald Trump. Republicans hold most major offices in Mississippi, which hasn’t had a Democrat in the U.S. Senate since 1989. Hyde-Smith was unopposed for the Republican nomination this year. She is the first woman to represent Mississippi in either chamber of Congress.  She was appointed to serve temporarily in the Senate when Republican Thad Cochran retired amid health concerns in early 2018. She and Espy were the final two candidates in a hard-fought special election later that year to occupy Cochran’s seat for the remaining two years of the six-year term. Hyde-Smith defeated Espy in a November 2018 runoff. Espy told reporters Tuesday night that he is better prepared for this election. “We’re going to build the greatest coalition of voters — white and black; rural and urban; male, female — that Mississippi’s ever seen,” Espy said. Hyde-Smith said Tuesday on Twitter, “We can let the Liberal Democrats with their socialist agenda know ... it may be alive and well in the heart of Nancy Pelosi, BUT IT IS DEAD IN MISSISSIPPI!” Espy defeated two candidates in Tuesday’s Democratic primary. Libertarian candidate Jimmy Edwards will also be on the ballot for Senate in November. In the final days leading to the 2018 runoff with Espy, a video showed Hyde-Smith praising a supporter at a campaign appearance by saying she would attend a “public hanging” if the man invited her. That prompted widespread criticism that Hyde-Smith was being insensitive in a state with a history of lynchings of African Americans. Hyde-Smith said it was “an exaggerated expression of regard” for the supporter. In 1986, Espy became Mississippi’s first African American congressman since Reconstruction. In 1993, President Bill Clinton named him agriculture secretary. Tuesday in the northern Mississippi town of Walls, Brandone Abrams said he voted for Espy because he respects his long political career. Abrams said Hyde-Smith’s 2018 comment about the public hanging bothered him. “You have an obligation as a leader to say the right things, and some things offend people,” Abrams said. “When you make certain comments, it shows your character.” John and Cheryl Peacock, a husband and wife, voted together in Jackson. They said they are backing Hyde-Smith because they see her as a strong Trump supporter. “I think she’s sticking to what she said she would do,” said Cheryl Peacock, 60, who has home-schooled their eight children. John Peacock, 63, who recently retired as an engineer for an electrical company, said he likes Hyde-Smith for “putting America first and being pro-life.” ____ Associated Press writer Adrian Sainz contributed to this report from Walls, Mississippi.",Espy wins Mississippi US Senate race; will face Hyde-Smith,2020-03-11T01:22:04Z,https://apnews.com/d439af2f92ae3d8c677173d5881f80fc,AP
"NEW YORK (AP) — NBC News analyst Claire McCaskill is talking about some of the shows on which she appears — “Morning Joe,” Rachel Maddow or Nicolle Wallace’s hours — when a questioner slips in a little test: What’s your favorite? She bats it away like an annoying fly. “I’m candid,” she said. “I’m not stupid.” Clearly, the political instincts of the former Democratic senator from Missouri haven’t dulled since her defeat in 2018. That’s also apparent on the air, where she has emerged as a colorful and blunt analyst through President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial and the presidential primaries. McCaskill said Trump’s impeachment lawyers had learned “the Trump ethos, which is if you’re cornered, just lie” and sharply rebuked Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee on the air. When there was a question about how the Senate was going to proceed on a vote to call witnesses during the impeachment trial, McCaskill took out her phone and texted several former colleagues for the lowdown. She’s been having a blast. “I have been shocked at how happy I am,” McCaskill said in a recent interview steps away from an MSNBC set. “I assumed it was going to be more painful than it has been, to not be in the fray but rather commenting on the fray.” After taking some time to unwind after losing her bid for a third term to Josh Hawley, the 66-year-old McCaskill found that news organizations looking for analysts were calling her instead of the other way around. She had always tried to be forthright when talking to reporters — as much as any politician can be — and her willingness to answer questions was noticed. She was comfortable with MSNBC after making frequent appearances there. Since crossing over to the media, McCaskill said she’s found “the freedom is exhilarating.” “The biggest transition was getting comfortable with the fact that I can say what I really think about Donald Trump,” she said. And what would that be? “Donald Trump is a disaster for our country,” she said. A little more diplomacy toward the president was required when she was active in Missouri politics, since the Republican carried the state in the 2016 election. It has also enabled McCaskill to see what supporters admire in him. “Let’s be honest, he hit some heartstrings,” she said when analyzing Trump’s State of the Union speech. “What people see when they see her on the air isn’t somebody who read a poll or is making her best guess,” Wallace said. “She lived it. She arrives at her position thoughtfully, not reflexively.” Wallace, former White House communications director in George W. Bush’s administration, said she enjoys talking to someone who understands politics and government from being a participant. She was giddy on the air watching McCaskill text colleagues for inside info. Wagging a finger and looking into the camera, McCaskill bluntly went after Blackburn during the impeachment hearings when the Republican tweeted criticism of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman. The White House national security aide was a key witness in the impeachment inquiry.  “Don’t you lecture anybody about how patriotic a veteran like Vindman is when you are going to the mat for a man who stood next to Putin and trashed the United States of America,” she said. Blackburn didn’t immediately return an email seeking comment from the AP about McCaskill. The AP reached out to the White House for comment about McCaskill’s criticism. McCaskill hasn’t yet come under sustained attack from Republicans. The last time Trump tweeted about her was to urge a vote for Hawley. After a McCaskill tweet suggested Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson was featured prominently in a picture of administration officials because he was one of the few black people there, Trump aide Katrina Pierson called her a “closet racist.” “How’s unemployment?” Donald Trump Jr. said in a tweet. McCaskill called the response “manufactured outrage.” Otherwise, she hasn’t gotten much critical attention because “you expect a Democrat to sound like a Democrat,” said Tim Graham, director of media analysis at the conservative Media Research Center. Being from a state like Missouri taught McCaskill that no matter what she did, roughly half of her constituents would be happy and the other half mad — and not hesitant to tell her. “Some people who have not been through the political wars that I have been would be worried about that level of negativity,” she said. “I get it. All in a day’s work. My bark is already so thick that it’s not like somebody calling me fat is going to make me cry.” Few people back home are surprised to see what she’s doing at NBC News, said Steve Kraske, a radio host at KCUR and a former newspaper columnist in Kansas City. As a senator, McCaskill would hold town hall meetings in the most conservative areas of the state, inviting audience members to write down questions that would randomly be drawn out of a hat so she couldn’t be accused of stage-managing the event, he said. “She’s got a lot of Harry Truman in her,” Kraske said, referencing another plainspoken Missouri politician. Her new perch has given McCaskill the ability to give viewers an insider’s knowledge about what it’s like to be in the Senate, such as a piece she did about the work of the Senate parliamentarian. She’s not happy about how the Senate has become more sharply partisan and noted that there’s no encouragement to build relationships with colleagues across the aisle. Even while watching the impeachment trial, McCaskill said she wasn’t wishing she was on the Senate floor. “Chuck (Schumer) has said to me several times since I made the transition that ‘you look so damn happy. Stay away from the members because I don’t want them getting the idea that there is life after the Senate,’” she said.",Claire McCaskill transitions from Senate to television,2020-03-10T17:38:45Z,https://apnews.com/8660dfacdc440a42f573b80b6ce2c557,AP
"FARGO, N.D. (AP) — Democrats moved Tuesday to bolster staffing at the largest of North Dakota’s 14 caucus sites after heavy turnout forced some voters in Fargo to wait in line as long as an hour. The party was expecting a big surge in turnout  due to a revamping of the state’s caucus system and high interest in the presidential race. North Dakota shifted this year from traditional caucuses to so-called “firehouse caucuses” that function largely like a typical election, with voters able to show up, cast a ballot and leave. The process is run by the parties. Democrats set up 14 voting sites around the state, with voting from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. The lines were longest in Fargo, the state’s largest city and home to North Dakota State University. The party said wait times in Grand Forks, home to the University of North Dakota, were about 40 minutes. Lines were shorter in Bismarck and Minot. “We’ve seen an exciting number of new voters and many people who need help looking up their voting districts, which adds some time to processing,” said Alex Rohr, state Democratic Party spokesman. “When we saw long lines, we activated additional volunteers, staff, and equipment.” To speed the process, workers handed people in line a form to fill out with information to determine their voting district in order to get a ballot. As the post-work rush began at the Fargo union hall, the party had set up five propane heaters to warm people in line outside, and traffic was growing with cars waiting to get into the hall parking lot or find a place to park. Volunteers were serving coffee in the parking lot, and the mood was mostly upbeat. When the line was cut off at 7 p.m., the scheduled closing time, about 250 people remained. The party said all would be allowed to vote, and they were expected to finish in about an hour. Bob Pieri, a professor at North Dakota State University and the very last in line, said Democrats should be happy with the big turnout. “They’ve kind of come out of the woodwork,” he said. “In prior elections there has hardly been anyone to populate the voting location.” “This is the way to do it,” said Debra Nelson, 68, of Fargo. She said the long lines at the F-M Labor Temple shows that people want a chance in Washington.  Rohr said the number of voting locations and the time frame for voting were dictated by Democrats’ “volunteer force. He pointed out that the party gave voters a mail-in option for people who didn’t want to or couldn’t travel significant distances to vote, or otherwise had problems. Rick Gion, a longtime North Dakota Democrat, said he received an “all hands on deck” call from the state party chair shortly before noon on Tuesday, asking for volunteers to help in Fargo. Gion spent much of his time helping handicapped people, families with babies and other people who may not have dressed for the occasion get moved inside. “People are so excited about getting President Trump out of office,” Gion said. “The lines are long and people are being so patient.” Billie Lentz, 20, a North Dakota State University student, said the wait in Fargo was worth it. “I am honestly blown away. I couldn’t be happier with this turnout,” said Lentz, originally an Amy Klobuchar supporter who switched her allegiance to Joe Biden. “I was happy to see this many people taking time out of their day making sure this was a priority.”",Hourlong waits prompt Democrats to bolster Fargo caucus site,2020-03-10T21:29:24Z,https://apnews.com/92e49b1cd2f101201af0abe6de5503fb,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — Securities and Exchange Commission employees have been encouraged to work remotely for the foreseeable future after a coronavirus scare at the agency’s Washington headquarters.  The agency, which oversees the financial markets, said it was informed Monday afternoon that a headquarters employee had received medical treatment for respiratory symptoms earlier in the day. The unidentified employee was informed by a doctor that they may have been infected with the virus and was referred for testing, the SEC said.  The SEC is the first major federal agency to employ teleworking in an effort to contain the virus’ spread. Also on Tuesday, American University announced it would temporarily shift to all-online classes in order to limit a potential spread of the virus.  Washington, D.C., has so far identified four local cases of coronavirus infections. The first identified case is the rector of a prominent Episcopalian church in Georgetown, prompting Washington officials to call for hundreds of parishioners to self-quarantine for two weeks. District officials announced Monday evening that the number had reached five, but they later reclassified one of those cases as residing in Maryland. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said Tuesday that it was “likely” that the number of identified infection cases would increase as testing continues.  Bowser said D.C. health officials continue to conduct “contact tracing” on the infected people to identify the way the virus has spread from person to person.  “Obviously this virus has a ripple effect and it’s critical to understand who in our community has been infected,” she said.  About a half-dozen members of the U.S. Congress are currently on 14-day self-quarantine after coming in contact with potentially infected people. On Tuesday, Virginia Democratic Rep. Don Beyer announced he would self-quarantine after dining 10 days ago with a person carrying the virus.  The SEC is a leading regulator of financial markets, which have suffered steep declines as the virus has spread around the world. The agency said the scattering of headquarters employees to work from their homes or other remote locations will not affect operations. Among other precautions, the agency “is encouraging headquarters employees to telework until further guidance,” it said.  “Even with increased telework, the SEC remains able and committed to fully executing its mission on behalf of investors, including monitoring market function and working closely with other regulators and market participants,” said the agency. American University is the first in the nation’s capital to make such a move, although other universities such as Harvard have done the same. “While the risk to our community remains low at this time, this could change quickly,” AU President Sylvia Burwell announced Tuesday in a letter to students.  Burwell, a former U.S. secretary of Health and Human Services, said the AU spring break — which started Monday and was scheduled to end on March 16 — would be extended through Wednesday March 18. Classes will resume in an online format on the 18th and continue that way through at least April 3.  The university dorms will remain open, but Burwell wrote, “We strongly encourage students to return to their homes” for the three weeks of online studies.",SEC asks DC workers to telecommute after employee is treated,2020-03-10T13:03:26Z,https://apnews.com/1b2e0c6942b404d7d10950e3c3956130,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden abruptly canceled election-night rallies Tuesday night in Cleveland amid concerns over the spread of the new coronavirus — as public health fears began transforming the 2020 race. The Democratic National Committee also announced that the party’s next debate, being held Sunday in Arizona, would not have a live audience, “at the request of both campaigns and out of an abundance of caution.” The moves suggest the coronavirus could upend the Democratic primary at a pivotal time in the race for both candidates. Sanders is trying to regain some momentum in the latest round of voting Tuesday night, while the former vice president is looking to further pad his delegate lead. Sanders had been planning to speak at a convention center in Cleveland as results from six voting states began rolling in. But he pulled the plug about three hours before the event was scheduled to start, and his campaign announced that decisions on future events would be made on a case-by-case basis.  “Out of concern for public health and safety, we are canceling tonight’s rally in Cleveland. We are heeding the public warnings from Ohio state officials, who have communicated concern about holding large, indoor events during the coronavirus outbreak,” Sanders’ campaign spokesman, Mike Casca, said in a statement. “All future Bernie 2020 events will be evaluated on a case by case basis.” A Biden spokesman initially suggested the former vice president’s own event in Cleveland would go on as scheduled, but his campaign subsequently released a statement saying that the event was off and that they would consult with public health officials about future events. Publicly, President Donald Trump’s campaign says coronavirus concerns have not yet affected their plans, and on Sunday, Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said, “The campaign is proceeding as normal.”  But at a White House press briefing Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence said that they’d evaluate future rallies “on a day to day basis.” “I am very confident that the campaign will take the very best information and make the very best decision going forward,” he said. The campaign hasn’t announced another rally to follow the president’s last one in North Carolina on March 2, though the campaign did announce a “Catholics for Trump” coalition event in Milwaukee on March 19. Until now, the Republican campaign had been keeping a steady pace of rallies this year. Trump is scheduled to travel to Las Vegas and Denver this week for fundraisers and a speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition. For both Democratic candidates, rallies have been a key opportunity to show off endorsements and build enthusiasm around their candidacy. But Democratic strategist Andrew Feldman suggested that forgoing future rallies could be particularly problematic for Sanders, whose events draw thousands of supporters in major cities. “It is a detriment to Bernie Sanders, who is fueled by his campaign rallies, by the people that come and are part of his revolution,” he said.  Feldman said both candidates would have to focus more on online organizing and outreach, using tools like streamed and tele-town halls. But he also argued that, even as the crisis is bad news for Americans, Trump’s handling of the issue — and the careening stock market — “is the biggest gift for Democrats.” “This is giving us an argument that the economy Donald Trump is going to be running on is not as strong as its supposed to be,” he noted. He said Biden could use the opportunity to make the case for his experience dealing with crises as vice president, while Sanders could use it to make a more emotional and direct case for “Medicare for All,” as reports come in of individuals facing steep medical bills simply for getting tested for the virus. And he also questioned whether the coronavirus could affect turnout — particularly among the elderly, who lean toward Biden. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose said Tuesday that 128 polling locations will be moved out of nursing homes for the state’s March 17 primary. Some Democrats worry the coronavirus could complicate not just rallies but also every aspect of the election, from turnout to fundraising and organizing. Kelly Dietrich, CEO of the National Democratic Training Committee, a group that trains Democrats who want to run for office or work on a campaign, said they’re already seeing a decline in people who have registered to participate in their training over fear of showing up to large gatherings. “It’s not even just in virus hot spots,” he said. “That fear is a prime motivator. It’s going to affect your campaign. It needs to be taken into account,” Dietrich added. He also said it’s causing the group to rethink how to organize more broadly.  “When we talk about door-knocking, generally you smile, you shake hands with the voter, you make a connection — all kinds of things that are now maybe taboo,” Dietrich said. “What do you do if people aren’t answering their doors anymore? How do you pivot to social or digital organizing?” DNC Communications Director Xochitl Hinojosa said Tuesday that the party decided to forgo a live audience at its next debate because its “number one priority has and will continue to be the safety of our staff, campaigns, Arizonans and all those involved in the debate.” Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine declared a state of emergency after three individuals from Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland, tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. He has “strongly” recommended that spectators be prohibited from attending indoor sports games — and said the same should be true for any large indoor event including concerts. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. Sanders is 78. Biden is 77. The vast majority of people recover from the virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to do so.  Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert, has stopped short of calling on candidates to put a pause on political rallies. But he also isn’t faulting anyone who chooses to do so, saying that what “they’re probably acting on is what they would consider for their citizens, an abundance of caution.”  “I wouldn’t criticize them for that. They’re using their own individual judgment,” Fauci said. “And to me, I think that that would be proven.” But he also added: “This is a something in motion. This is an evolving thing” so “if you’re talking about a campaign rally tomorrow in a place where there is no community spread, I think the judgment to have it might be a good judgment.” ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.” ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — At the Pentagon, top military brass have been begun “social distancing” to avoid spreading disease. At the Capitol, legislators have been encouraged to forgo hand shakes and flash the “Star Trek” Vulcan greeting instead. But at the White House, President Donald Trump is flouting his own government’s advice on how to stay safe. He continues to shake hands with supporters and visitors, hold large events and minimize the threat posed by a coronavirus outbreak that has infected more than 115,000 people and killed over 4,000 worldwide. Public health officials said Trump was sending the wrong message with his behavior and potentially putting the public at risk by sowing confusion and undermining efforts to keep people safe, especially if the situation grows worse. “I think it’s beholden upon our leaders to follow the public health recommendations that the CDC, the government, public health are recommending and to emulate those practices,” said Dr. Jason Farley, a nurse epidemiologist and professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing. He said that it sends “mixed messaging to the public” when recommendations aren’t heeded. When it comes to Trump, he added, “There’s nothing special about being the president of the United States that protects you from a virus like this unless you’re following the practices recommended for every 70-year-old.” Trump has repeatedly played down the risk, both to the public and himself, even as he claims that his administration is “taking this unbelievably seriously.”  “It will go away. Just stay calm,” Trump told reporters Tuesday. “Everybody has to be vigilant and has to be careful. But be calm. It’s really working out. And a lot of good things are going to happen.” When it comes to Trump’s continued glad-handing, Vice President Mike Pence said Tuesday that’s unlikely to change despite going against the administration’s “broad recommendation” for other Americans. “In our line of work, you shake hands when someone wants to shake your hand,” he said. “And I expect the president will continue to do that. I’ll continue to do it.” For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. But for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illnesses, including pneumonia.  Trump, at 73, is considered at higher risk, although his press secretary said Monday he “remains in excellent health.”  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urges those at higher risk of getting the virus to take “everyday precautions to keep space between yourself and others,” avoid crowds, handshaking and nonessential air travel. “During a COVID-19 outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible to further reduce your risk of being exposed,” the CDC writes. Overall, the CDC has suggested that workplaces encourage employees to stop shaking hands, use videoconferences for meetings when possible and hold meetings in well-ventilated spaces if meetings are necessary.  That hasn’t happened at the White House, where Trump, a self-professed “germophobe,” sat shoulder-to-shoulder Tuesday with aides and health insurance executives, traveled to Capitol Hill for a Senate lunch and awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom at a well-attended ceremony, where he also shook hands with those in the front row. On Monday, Trump was spotted shaking hands with supporters on a tarmac in Florida. And on Thursday, he’s set to travel to the West Coast, where he’ll attend fundraisers and the annual gathering of the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas. All that, despite the fact that Trump has already had personal contact with several individuals known to have been exposed to the virus. They include Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, who traveled aboard Air Force One with the president on Monday and found out midflight that he was among a handful of GOP lawmakers who were exposed to a person who tested positive for the virus after last month’s Conservative Political Action Conference. Gaetz voluntarily quarantined himself, as have several other legislators who had contact with the infected person at CPAC, including Trump’s incoming chief of staff. “The President’s physician, United States Secret Service, and White House Operations have been working closely with staff and various agencies to ensure every precaution is taken to keep the President, First Family and the entire White House Complex safe and healthy at all times,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said in response to questions. He did not provide specifics about the nature of those precautions, though the White House has repeatedly cited Trump’s propensity for hand-washing, and Trump has joked that he’s avoided touching his face so long he’s missed it. “As we are all doing, Americans should continue to follow the CDC’s guidance on travel and public gatherings, which includes staying home if you feel ill, as well as frequently washing your hands with soap and water,” he said. The White House has begun to install hand-sanitizer dispensers around the building, and some visitors to the building have been asked to report where they’ve traveled recently — though many who interact with the president regularly have received no kind of heightened screening. Lawrence Gostin, a public heath expert and professor at Georgetown University, said he believed it would be appropriate to implement enhanced screening at the White House to keep the president and Cabinet safe. “This is no different than being protected by a bullet from the Secret Service,” he said. “Not only should they be following general health advice we give to the public, they should be following much more rigorously ... because we can’t be in a political crisis at the same time we’re in a public health crisis.” Elsewhere across government, the response has been more robust. At the Pentagon, Defense Department officials have been sitting at least six feet apart, in line with health guidance. And on Tuesday, reporters’ chairs were spread out for a news briefing. On Capitol Hill, Democratic lawmakers were barred from helping themselves to a breakfast buffet or touching serving utensils, and told to avoid kissing, hugging and shaking hands. But not Trump — a pattern that Robert Blendon, a professor of health policy at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, said appeared motivated by Trump’s desire to protect the economy in an election year. “Right or wrong, the president’s decided he wants to minimize the economic impact of this pandemic. ... He’s trying to do everything he can to protect the economy by saying, ‘It will be over,’ ‘It’s not that bad,’ ‘Feel free to go places,’” Blendon said. While much uncertainly remains, “if it turns out to be more serious, the president’s contributing to people not protecting themselves.” “The president should be keeping us safe. He shouldn’t be amplifying the risk,” added Gostin of Georgetown University. “The message should be: Let’s have social distancing, let’s avoid the usual cultural symbols of shaking hands, let’s separate from one another and avoid either contracting or transmitting a very dangerous infection,” Gostin said. “And it’s baffling to me that the president, who should be the model of good behavior, is modeling exactly the opposite.” ___ Follow Colvin on Twitter at https://twitter.com/colvinj ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s proposed payroll tax break met with bipartisan resistance Tuesday on Capitol Hill as pressure mounts on the administration and Congress to work more vigorously to contain the coronavirus outbreak and respond to the financial fallout. Flanked by his economic team, Trump pitched his economic stimulus ideas privately to wary Senate Republicans on another grueling day in the struggle against expanding infections. Fluctuating stock markets rebounded  but communities discovered new cases and the two top Democratic presidential candidates, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, canceled Tuesday primary night rallies in Ohio.  The president’s GOP allies have been cool to additional spending at this stage, especially for cutting taxes that would have to be reimposed later — presumably after the November election. Democrats prefer their own package of low- or no-cost virus testing, unemployment insurance and sick pay for workers struggling to keep paychecks coming as the outbreak disrupts workplaces. “We’re taking this unbelievably seriously,” Trump said after his meeting at the Capitol. “It will go away, just stay calm.” Asked why he has not yet been tested for the virus, after having been in close contact with several advisers and members of Congress who are now self-quarantined after exposure, Trump said: “I don’t think it’s a big deal” and “I feel very good.”  White House officials have been blindsided by the president’s sudden moves. As Trump headed to Capitol Hill, two administration officials said the proposals he was putting in play had not been completed. They were unauthorized to discuss the planning and requested anonymity.  Trump’s team offered few specifics at the closed door GOP lunch on the size of the payroll tax break or its duration, senators said. Trump has long promised to bring about an election year “tax cuts 2.0,” and seemed to be seizing on the virus fears as a way to bring about a victory on that front before November. Behind closed doors he discussed the coming elections in swing states like Arizona and Montana where GOP senators face tough races. In addition to payroll tax relief, Trump has said he wants help for hourly-wage workers to ensure they’re “not going to miss a paycheck” and “don’t get penalized for something that’s not their fault.” He’s also mentioned small-business loans. But details are slight. So far, the president’s approach, based on tax breaks, is receiving a cool response. Some Republicans endorsed Trump’s suggestion that help be provided to the beleaguered cruise-ship and airline industries, while others spoke up for other industries, including energy and gas. Some pushed for broader economic stimulus from a bipartisan highway bill they said was shovel-ready and popular. The payroll tax plan remains a work in progress. “They didn’t get into specifics,” said the No. 2 Republican, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota. Increasingly, it appears a solution will originate in the House, where Speaker Nancy Pelosi told House Democrats they would keep working this week despite concerns about the risk of infection at the Capitol. “We are the captains of the ship,” Pelosi said during a closed-door meeting, according to a person in the room unauthorized to discuss the private caucus and granted anonymity. “We are the last to leave.” But time is short as Congress heads toward its scheduled break next week. Trump tapped Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to meet with Pelosi, whose support will be needed for any deal in the divided Congress, where Republicans hold the Senate majority but Democrats hold the House.  Munchin declared the meeting with Pelosi “productive” and said they’d “work together on a bipartisan basis to figure out how we can get things done quickly.” Pelosi insisted the “threshold” for any proposal must be its ability to respond to the virus. Her team was preparing to come out with a package in the next day or so.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was noncommittal after the meeting with Trump, emphasizing the path forward rests in the talks between Mnuchin and Pelosi. “We’re hoping that he and the speaker can pull this together,” he said. That reflected divisions even within the administration on the best approach. The payroll-tax plan found support from Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner and trade adviser Peter Navarro, among others. Other aides, including Mnuchin and Larry Kudlow advocated more modest measures. Trump prefers the payroll tax holiday “last through the end of the year,” Kudlow said. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.  The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 58,000 have so far recovered. In Washington, there were mixed signals about the public mood. Tourists still arrived for visits while marquee events, including this weekend’s Gridiron Club dinner, an annual mingling of political Washington, was postponed.  At the U.S. Capitol, some senators said they resisted shaking Trump’s hand when he arrived for lunch. Lawmakers were given new instructions on how to protect themselves, with the House’s attending physician asking them to stop shaking hands or touching people during greetings. He recommended the split-fingers Star Trek greeting instead. Crowds are the norm in the Capitol and handshakes are coin of the realm there, even between political foes. But about a half dozen lawmakers — including Trump confidantes — have placed themselves in quarantine after being exposed to someone who had the virus, and the norm has been upended. One, GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz, who self-quarantined after having traveled with the president from Florida on Air Force One on Monday, said he had tested negative for the disease. He said he would remain quarantined as a precaution. Another, Trump’s incoming chief of staff. Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C, remains on quarantine.  During House Democrats’ closed session, one lawmaker, California Rep. Raul Ruiz, who is a doctor, raised concerns about the situation, noting that the average age in Congress is 57. Some lawmakers have underlying health conditions and their work requires them to fly back and forth between home and the capital. Still, Pelosi implored lawmakers to keep working to strengthen the country’s defenses.  But House and Senate leaders have made it clear there will be no voting by proxy. Quarantined lawmakers will be missing votes. Lawmakers were told up to 10,000 staff members could telework, if need be.  The Securities and Exchange Commission, which monitors financial markets, encouraged employees at its Washington headquarters to work from home after an employee there had respiratory symptoms and was referred for coronavirus testing.  And Defense Secretary Mark Esper postponed a trip to India, Pakistan and Uzbekistan that was to begin Monday, citing the coronavirus crisis, Pentagon press secretary Alyssa Farah said Tuesday. She said he would remain in the U.S to help manage the Pentagon response.  ___ Associated Press writers Lauran Neergaard, Andrew Taylor, Kevin Freking, Jill Colvin, Bob Burns, and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — The government has a palette of options it can use to shore up an economy imperiled by anxiety over the coronavirus outbreak. They start with the “middle-class” payroll tax cut that President Donald Trump is suggesting and include quicker, more targeted federal aid as well. But the options could come with pitfalls and may raise unrealistic expectations.  The White House and Congress have started wrangling over measures to spark the wounded economy, as fear around COVID-19 has threatened to tip it into recession. The crisis of confidence over the virus, with more than 118,000 people infected worldwide and 29 deaths in the U.S., is keeping American consumers — the spending engine of the economy — away from public places like shopping malls, grocery stores and movie theaters. Beyond the payroll tax cut, stimulus measures that may be considered include aid to wage earners missing work because of illness or quarantine who don’t receive sick pay, special loans for small businesses, subsidies or tax relief to affected industries like airlines, hotels and cruise ships, and aid to certain parts of the country bearing the brunt of virus illnesses and deaths. Aiding wage earners who don’t receive sick pay is a top priority along with the payroll tax break, Larry Kudlow, a senior economic adviser to Trump, told reporters at the White House Tuesday evening. He said they’re also considering assistance to small and medium-size businesses and possibly to some distressed industries. “Everything the Trump administration has proposed so far is way too small,” says Simon Johnson, an economics professor at MIT’s Sloan School of Management who’s an expert on financial and economic crises. Johnson wants to see emergency sick pay covered substantially by the government, overtime paid to health care workers, and a massive transfer along the lines of a proposal by a top economic adviser to President Obama. Congress would send every American adult $1,000 and $500 to every child under Jason Furman’s proposal, at an estimated ultimate cost to taxpayers of $350 billion. Trump’s signature proposal of a payroll tax cut has spurred criticism from both conservatives and liberals, and it met bipartisan resistance Tuesday on Capitol Hill. “It’s a very untargeted measure,” said Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate economist who teaches at Columbia University. “Some Americans are at the brink. They need to show up to work to feed their families.” That means infected people could come to work in restaurants, extending a vicious cycle, he said. Help is needed to cover low-income workers’ sick leave.  At a White House briefing Monday, after another day of stock market convulsion drove the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its steepest one-day drop ever of 2,013 points, Trump put forward a possible payroll tax cut as a centerpiece of his team’s emergency economic plan. Kudlow said the White House team is looking at a suspension of all payroll taxes, paid by employers and workers, through the end of the year. “It’s a bold move; it’s a very bold move. And this is a bold president,” he said.  It’s an idea that Trump considered last summer to avert an economic slowdown, as some experts warned the U.S. was heading for a pullback that could hurt his reelection chances. But Trump quickly reversed course and touted the economy’s strength, blaming the Federal Reserve and its Chairman Jay Powell for not cutting interest rates. With payroll taxes, employers deduct some money from workers each pay period, normally as a percentage of their salary. It goes toward advance payment of income taxes, and contributions to Social Security and unemployment and disability insurance.  Cutting that may sound like a winner, especially in an election year.  But critics say such a cut would be unfair because it favors higher-income wage earners — not gig workers, people knocked into joblessness by economic dislocation or coronavirus quarantine, and others with only part-time jobs or who are self-employed. At any rate, some experts say, no matter how much emergency cash might be freed up by the government, consumers may not spend it to jump-start the economy if they’re afraid to open their doors.  “It’s a different kind of shock,” said Kenneth Rogoff, a professor of public policy and economics at Harvard who’s an expert on financial crises across time. “You don’t have enough money to buy stuff and the government makes a transfer to you, that’s great — but not if you’re hiding under the bed.” Instead, critics point to solutions that target federal aid directly to the health care sector and efforts to contain and fight against the coronavirus: for manufacturing face masks and virus test kits, developing vaccines, adding new hospital ICUs and ventilators. Funneling support to certain industries such as airlines, hotels and the oil business could unleash a torrent of special-interest jockeying on Capitol Hill as companies seek special status and exemptions, and lawmakers champion businesses in their states and districts. Trump on Tuesday said the cruise industry and airlines are facing particular difficulties and added: “They’re two great industries and we’ll be helping them through this rough patch.” ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Trump administration hoped to announce an agreement Friday on a coronavirus aid package to reassure anxious Americans by providing sick pay, free testing and other resources in an effort to calm teetering financial markets and the mounting crisis. Final details were being worked out, but the top House Democrat, who held daylong talks with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, expected an announcement Friday. The House could then swiftly vote. Mnuchin said Friday morning that negotiations were going very well. “I think we’re very close to getting this done,” Mnuchin said, appearing on CNBC.  On the COVID-19 illness, Mnuchin cautioned that “people should understand the numbers are going to go up before they go down.” Emerging from her office at the Capitol late Thursday, Pelosi said an agreement on an aid package was near. She said a deal was “subject to an exchange of paper and we hope to have an announcement tomorrow.” Pelosi and Mnuchin spoke again early Friday. The potential deal between Congress and the White House would cap a tumultuous week in which Washington strained for a comprehensive response to the outbreak that is testing the nation’s political, financial and health care systems. President Donald Trump has struggled to show he’s on top of the crisis, after delivering conflicting descriptions of what the U.S. is doing to combat the virus. Classes, sports events, concerts and conferences have been canceled across the nation and the financial markets have been cratering. The House aid package builds on an emergency $8.3 billion measure approved last week and is aimed at providing additional health and financial resources to arrest the sudden spread of the pandemic and the kind of economic fallout unseen in a generation. Pelosi promised in a letter to colleagues that a third package was yet to come. The new sick leave benefit would require businesses to provide up to 14 days of paid leave to workers who are home quarantined with the virus, with the federal government reimbursing them through tax credits. The bill facilitates unemployment benefits for those laid off during the crisis and boosts food and nutrition programs for working families, students and seniors. Work requirements for food stamps would be suspended, and states would be given additional Medicaid funds to cope with the crisis. “We felt that putting together something that the American people can see cooperation on between the two parties in this difficult moment would be a confidence builder,” said Rep. Richard Neal, D-N.J., the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Pelosi promised the third coronavirus package will follow soon, though the House is leaving Washington on Friday for a previously scheduled recess. That measure will include more aggressive steps to boost the U.S. economy, which economists fear has already slipped into recession.  But there’s little appetite within either party for Trump’s proposal to suspend collection of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax, and Democratic economic stimulus ideas like higher more generous food stamp benefits aren’t favored by Republicans, while Democrats aren’t very friendly to GOP ideas like easing business regulations. States are already clamoring for fiscal relief from Washington as the virus threatens their budgets. Mnuchin, however, said on Friday that the president remains committed to pursuing the payroll tax cut. “It is a giant stimulus.”  Disruptions from the virus spread throughout the Washington metropolitan area, as the Capitol, White House and Supreme Court all declared themselves off limits to the public for now, symbols of a nation hunkering down. And schools in the District of Columbia announced they would close, starting Monday, until April 1.  The storied Smithsonian said it was canceling all public events and will temporarily close its network of museums and the National Zoo, starting Saturday. And Trump proposed postponing this summer’s Olympics in Japan for a year, too. Trump said he will halt his signature campaign rallies, telling reporters he needs a “little separation until such time as this goes away.” Democratic presidential rivals Joe Biden and rival Sen. Bernie Sanders said they would no longer hold large political gatherings and their staffs would work from home as the race for the presidency moved online. The coronavirus crisis also got personal for Trump and some members of Congress.  Australian Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton was in isolation at a hospital after testing positive for the coronavirus. He returned to Australia on Sunday from Washington, where he met Attorney General William Barr and Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, last week.  White House officials, including representatives for Ivanka Trump, have not responded to questions about whether they intend to be tested or self-quarantine. The White House has insisted officials are following CDC guidelines and that, “there is currently no indication to test patients without symptoms, and only people with prolonged close exposure to confirmed positive cases should self-quarantine.” Barr, meanwhile, was staying home Friday, though he “felt great and wasn’t showing any symptoms,” according to his spokeswoman Kerri Kupec. She said the CDC did not recommend testing at this point.  In addition, just days after meeting Trump and Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., the communications chief for Brazil’s president, Fábio Wajngarten, tested positive for coronavirus. A photo of the president, the senator and Wajngarten shows the trio shoulder-to-shoulder at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort last weekend. Scott said he was isolating himself. Trump, 73, said he was unworried.  “We had dinner in Florida at Mar-a-Lago with the entire delegation,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “But we did nothing very unusual. We sat next to each other for a period of time.” Asked whether he should be tested, Trump replied, “I am not concerned.” White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said “the White House is aware of public reports that a member of the Brazilian delegation‘s visit to Mar-a-Lago last weekend tested positive for COVID-19” though; confirmatory testing is pending.  She said: “Both the President and Vice President had almost no interactions with the individual who tested positive and do not require being tested at this time.” GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, who was also at Trump’s club on the weekend, joined a growing list of lawmakers who have chosen to isolate themselves as a precaution. Lawmakers from both parties expressed alarm at the U.S. response, and especially over the fact few patients have been tested.  “We’re basically, in my opinion, flying blind,” said Rep. Susie Lee, D-Nev.  Dr. Anthony Fauci, infectious disease chief at the National Institutes of Health, in several television interviews Friday, said more tests would be available over the next week, but that officials should not wait before trying to mitigate the virus’ effects.  “We will have considerably more testing in the future, but you don’t wait for testing,” Fauci said on ”CBS This Morning.” He said school closings and similar measures are “generally an appropriate approach.” “We’re at a critical point now as we seek to blunt the rise in cases to make sure it’s a hill, not a mountain,” Fauci said on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.  The vast majority of people recover. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to be over it. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, about 81,000 people have been diagnosed and about 64,000 have recovered. Trump’s Wednesday announcement of travel restrictions prompted clarifications, criticisms and confusion. While Trump said all European travel except from Britain would be cut off, Homeland Security officials clarified that the new travel restrictions would apply only to most foreign nationals who have been in the Schengen Area at any point in the 14 days prior to their scheduled arrival to the United States. The area encompasses most European countries, among them France, Italy, German, Greece, Austria and Belgium. The restrictions don’t apply to legal permanent residents, immediate family of U.S. citizens or others identified in the proclamation signed by Trump. Vice President Mike Pence said the administration is also asking travelers returning to the U.S. from Europe to voluntarily quarantine for 14 days. Trump claimed falsely Thursday that the U.S. is currently screening all Americans and foreigners who are entering the country, saying, “people coming in have to be tested.” And he claimed that those who return are being forced to isolate themselves, adding: “It’s going to be a pretty strong enforcement of quarantine.” No widespread quarantine orders have been announced. ___ Associated Press writers Aamer Madhani, Lauran Neergaard, Martin Crutsinger, Laurie Kellman, Michael Balsamo and Kevin Freking in Washington and Bill Barrow in Atlanta contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"President Donald Trump’s administration announced Friday it is awarding $1.3 million to two companies trying to develop rapid COVID-19 tests that could detect whether a person is positive for the new coronavirus within an hour.

"The chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus has endorsed Joe Biden for president, an influential nod of support that could bolster his 2020 Democratic campaign. The endorsement by Democratic Rep. Karen Bass of California on Friday is the latest testament of a growing coalescence of support for Biden’s White House bid. Biden’s campaign has seen a resurgence powered by black voters, who have helped cement his front-runner status after commanding wins in several recent primaries, including in South Carolina, in several Southern states and just this week in Michigan.  “It’s very clear to me that he is the best person, not just to beat (President Donald) Trump, but he is the person to lead at this time,” Bass said in an interview with The Associated Press. “I think him having a long-standing history of working with African American communities, most notably in his own state but around the country, was qualitatively different from the other candidates.” Biden’s progressive rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has performed well among younger and Latino voters, has struggled to garner support within the African American community. Black voters will continue to be a key demographic as both campaigns eye upcoming primary contests in states with large black populations, like Georgia. Bass said she held off endorsing a candidate because two CBC members, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, were running for president. Booker and Harris have since dropped out and endorsed Biden, a former vice president and U.S. senator from Delaware. The CBC as a whole is not officially endorsing a candidate, Bass said, but the majority of members have already announced support for Biden. The powerful group, created in 1971, is composed of most African American members of Congress, making up nearly 25% of the Democratic majority in the House. Of the 54-member group, 37 have endorsed Biden, including House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, who has been credited with helping turn the tide for Biden with a big win in Clyburn’s home state of South Carolina. One member of the CBC, Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, has endorsed Sanders. Although Biden has strong support within the African American community, especially among older voters, concerns have been raised about his ability to energize young and progressive voters. Bass, a progressive Democrat who is serving her fifth term in a congressional district that includes south Los Angeles and Culver City, said she believes Biden would be able to grow support among those groups, if he were to become the eventual nominee. “As this race settles down, it is my job personally and the job of members of the Congressional Black Caucus to be extremely clear with people in our districts what is at stake here, and what is at stake is their future,” Bass said. “It’s a job that we’ve all been doing over the last 3 1/2 years, but we have to step it up.” Asked whether Sanders and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii should drop out of the race to unite the party before the Democratic National Convention, Bass said she believes the primary process needs to run its course and allow every voter the chance to weigh in. “I would never be in a position to say, ‘You need to drop out,’” Bass said. “I do think, though, that math is math.” She continued: “I think they have to do the soul searching and say, ‘Why am I still doing this?’ But I think that’s an individual decision or a campaign decision.” Bass said she hopes, though, that the eventual nominee considers a person of color as his running mate. “I think that a presidential candidate has got to choose somebody that they feel that they can trust, that they can work with,” Bass said. “Now, having said that, I certainly hope it’s a woman. I certainly hope it’s a woman of color.” ___ Kat Stafford is a member of The Associated Press’ Race and Ethnicity team.

"MIAMI (AP) — Florida has never been known as a place of stability, especially in its politics. And yet stability is what has been on the minds of many Democrats in the state who say they’ll vote for former Vice President Joe Biden in Tuesday’s presidential primary election instead of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. “I like some of Sanders’ ideas, but he’s a little too extreme for me,” said Jeanne Hilburn, a 76-year-old retired teacher who lives in the suburbs of Tampa. “A lot of Democrats are like me — we want stability.” As the race for the Democratic nomination enters a penultimate phase, with Sanders’ campaign on the brink of collapse and Biden’s ascendant, attention is turning to places like Florida, which is holding its primary on Tuesday along with Ohio, Illinois and Arizona. Florida has 219 delegates, the biggest prize of next week’s election. Few places hold the electoral cachet of Florida, which has been among the most coveted swing states in the last three decades, including during the contentious, chaotic recount of 2000. It is a vital state for President Donald Trump, who would have almost no path to reelection without it. Biden’s advisers are banking on a decisive Florida victory that sends a clear message that he is much better positioned to win the state and deny Trump a second term. In 2016, Trump defeated Hillary Clinton here by 1.2 percentage points. “Florida, as always, is pivotal in the outcome,” said Nikki Fried, who is the state’s agriculture commissioner and top elected Democrat and who endorsed Biden. “We are the ultimate swing state.” Sanders’ support in Florida has always been tenuous. In the 2016 primary, he lost to Clinton by a nearly 2-to-1 margin. This year, Sanders angered a potentially large voting bloc — Cuban Americans — by praising Fidel Castro for implementing a literacy program in the communist nation. “There is nothing positive you can say about the conditions in Cuba. If he doesn’t understand that, it is hard to conceive that he will get any votes,” said Xavier Suarez, who was the first Cuban-born mayor of Miami and is now running as an independent in the county mayoral race. “It’s gonna be a massacre.” That leaves many Florida Democrats looking beyond the primary to November. Several groups have banded together to register people to vote and mobilize for November.  One of the four groups, Organizing Together 2020, is led by Fried. It will hire employees, register voters, train volunteers and then turn everything over to the party after the July convention. Another of the groups is For Our Future, a super PAC that is made up largely of Mike Bloomberg’s campaign apparatus.  A strong turnout in the Florida primary could give hope to Democrats, though it would be difficult to draw any conclusions for November given the state’s high number of independents. And, to be sure, the coronavirus outbreak could keep some voters away from the polls and muffle any message from the turnout. Democrats know it will be a challenge to sway voters here. About 3.6 million of the state’s 13.6 million voters are registered independents, which means they can’t vote in Tuesday’s primary but are eligible to cast ballots in the general election. “Florida is an interesting state. Depending on where you’re at, we can be very conservative, or we can be very progressive,” said St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman, a Democrat. “We also have a strong moderate and independent streak. Biden, I think he’ll do well here with Democrats and independents. And with Republicans who are looking for an alternative to President Trump.” Ashley Walker, of Organizing Together, said a priority is grassroots door-knocking in counties that were close in 2016, like Pinellas, home to St. Petersburg, which Trump won by 5,500 votes, and in Pasco, a suburban county just north of Tampa where voters moved to Republican candidates in the 2018 Senate and gubernatorial races. Walker says the aim is to siphon off votes there. “The margins matter. We’re probably not going to win Pasco County, but we’re going to need to close the margins so we lose less badly,” she said. “And in those counties that go back-and-forth between red and blue, like Pinellas, it’s especially important to get organized early. To build relationships early.” Similarly, Biden’s supporters have been paying visits to Spanish-language TV shows and broadening “diaspora outreach” efforts in South Florida. John Kerry, the former secretary of state and the Democratic presidential nominee in 2004, spoke about Latin America policy on behalf of Biden’s campaign at a restaurant in Doral, the hub of Venezuelan exiles.  “We feel good about where we are in the state, but we are not taking anything for granted,” said Carmen Torres, of Florida Hispanics for Biden. Democrats don’t have a lock on the Latino vote in Florida, particularly among the nearly 2 million residents who are originally from Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, where authoritarian socialist regimes have soured many exiles toward any left-leaning politicians. A third of Cuban American midterm voters identify as Democrats, according to AP Vote Cast, a wide-ranging survey of the elecotrate. But the survey said a majority, 56%, of Cuban American midterm voters expressed approval of the way Trump was handling his job as president.  Daisy Baez, a former Democratic state lawmaker, is leading a group called “Dominicanos con Biden” to rally her fellow Dominican Americans to support the former vice president. A similar effort to rally Venezuelans will roll out on Sunday. “We wanted to address our message to a specific community,” Baez said. “We needed to piece it down in smaller parts.” As Sanders’ chances diminish, Biden may also need to win over his challenger’s fervent supporters if an endorsement follows. Some may not follow suit. Nick Mora, 24, a Florida International University Student, marched alongside 20 students on a recent afternoon on campus to persuade others to vote early for Sanders. Mora acknowledged Sanders’ defeat earlier this week was disappointing but said they were not ready to give up yet. “Let’s just say Joe Biden does not have the same policy proposals as Bernie,” Mora said. “I feel like the progressive movement is being pushed down, and there’s not much we can do about it if we vote for Joe Biden, so we are still trying to fight till the end.” ___ Lush reported from St. Petersburg, Fla. ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.”",Florida could be knockout punch for Sanders’ 2020 campaign,2020-03-13T04:24:56Z,https://apnews.com/9d7d4614b0a33fb63e68ecb666b0d6da,AP
"BOSTON (AP) — Colleges across the U.S. have begun canceling and curtailing graduation amid fears that the coronavirus pandemic will stretch into spring. Some are exploring “virtual” alternatives, while others are considering inviting seniors back for commencement at a later date or just mailing out diplomas. Schools including Brigham Young University, the Savannah College of Art and Design and Berea College are among those telling students that current commencement ceremonies have been canceled. But dozens of other schools say it’s too soon to decide, leaving families uncertain about whether to book flights and hotels and students wondering whether to purchase caps and gowns for the walk across the stage. The graduation decision is being made as colleges scramble to move instruction online and send students home, a move being made by dozens of schools in an attempt to curb spread of the virus. The list of those moving to the web continued to grow Thursday, with schools from Southern Methodist University to the University of Alaska making the change. At Grinnell College in Iowa, which is sending students home this month, officials said there will be no “traditional” graduation ceremony. Instead, the school is mulling how it could honor graduating seniors in an online ceremony. Officials are also debating whether to bring seniors back in 2021 and offer a ceremony for two classes at once. “We want to be celebrate and cherish our students,” said Anne Harris, dean and vice president for academic affairs at the private school of 1,700 students. “But we were following the logic: If we’re sending everybody out, why would we bring everybody back in?” Some students say they understand the need for caution but would feel robbed if they missed a milestone that they spent years working to reach. At Wesleyan University in Connecticut, which is still weighing options, senior Melisa Olgun said commencement is a celebration not only of her college career but also the sacrifices that her parents, immigrants from Turkey, made to get her there. Olgun is the first in her family to graduate from a U.S. university and wants her mother to see her accept her diploma. “This diploma is not just for myself. It’s for my family, it’s for my parents,” Olgun said. “That ability to stand on that stage, to do that, is something I’ve been thinking of and dreaming of since I was a young girl.” Still, she feels conflicted about a possible cancellation. “On one hand I’m very sad, but I also acknowledge the seriousness of the situation and I’m trying to be rational and understanding about that,” she said. Officials at Cornell University said they still hope to host their traditional ceremony but warned that it’s unknown whether that will be possible. Florida International University told students that events are expected to proceed but said officials are also working on “possible alternative plans.” The coronavirus has infected around 128,000 people worldwide and killed over 4,700. The death toll in the U.S. climbed to 39, with over 1,300 infections. For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illnesses, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the virus in a matter of weeks. Schools say they’re following the advice of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention and state health officials who are recommending against mass gatherings as the virus spreads. Governors in some states have called for limits on large events. But schools say it’s hard to forecast where things will stand in two months, and some say it would be premature to cancel. Some colleges, however, said they’re canceling now so they don’t force parents to scuttle their plans at the last minute. Berea College in Kentucky was among the first to cancel ceremonies this week, telling students it would be rescheduled “to a date when such a gathering can be conducted safely.” Officials said they were erring on the side of caution but still want to honor graduates. “They’ve worked hard and we want to recognize all that they’ve accomplished. But we want to do that in a way that protects them and doesn’t jeopardize their safety,” said Tim Jordan, a school spokesman. Canceling commencement can also carry financial implications for schools. Some colleges spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on ceremonies featuring celebrity speakers, dining spreads and other displays of pomp and circumstance. Colleges that have canceled say they don’t know if their speakers will return for later events, or how the cancellation will affect budgets. Some schools, including Tulane University are already announcing that, in case of a cancellation, students will be refunded for their regalia purchases. Some schools are scaling back ceremonies without eliminating them entirely. The Florida Institute of Technology says the school’s spring ceremony will be broken into several smaller events that only students will be allowed to attend. Families will be able to watch online, officials said, and graduates can also return for summer or fall exercises. California State University, Sacramento, said it will make a decision about commencement once officials have “a better understanding of the ongoing impact” of the virus. But the school has decided to cancel all other graduation activities, including hooding ceremonies and cultural celebrations. Graduation cancellations rare but not without precedent in the United States. Colleges across the nation scrapped ceremonies in 1970 amid protests over the Vietnam War, and some invited students back to be honored decades later. More recently, outdoor ceremonies in Florida and Texas have been called off amid heavy storms, but most were rescheduled later. At Harvard University, senior Tom Osborn is now wondering whether his family from Migori, Kenya, should cancel their plans to visit for graduation. The school, which is sending students home this week, said it’s too soon to make a decision but officials are working on contingency plans. “It was going to be my family’s first time to campus. They were all excited,” said Osborn, who is studying psychology. “It’s unfortunate. I hope things will still work out.” ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — It’s a “foreign” virus, he says — one that can be fought by closing the nation’s borders to dangerous foreigners carrying scary disease.  President Donald Trump has turned to a familiar playbook as he tries to grapple with the spiraling coronavirus outbreak, blaming immigrants for the country’s problems and casting the global health pandemic as another case of the U.S. against the world.  It’s an approach that public health officials say ignores the new reality of a situation that is fueling panic and confusion and fundamentally altering the American way of life. But it’s business as usual for an isolationist president who once proposed barring Muslims from entering the country and has worked throughout his presidency to fortify the nation’s borders and find novel ways to keep out those he deems unworthy, diseased or unsafe. The pattern was especially jarring during Trump’s rare Oval Office address to the nation Wednesday night. Instead of calling on Americans to lock arms with other nations to take on a common foe, Trump instead pointed the finger. He blamed Europe for fueling the virus’ continued advancement — even as the U.S. has struggled to provide basic testing, local cases skyrocket and pockets of disease increase. Trump credited his decision to restrict travel from China for keeping the U.S. case count low and then announced he would be extending his ban to some of America’s closest allies as he took the unprecedented step of sharply restricting travel from much of Europe to the U.S. “The European Union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hot spots,” Trump said. “As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe.” To be sure, infectious disease experts agree that limiting travel from countries badly affected by a virus can help stop its spread. The impacted region is home to several countries that have been struggling to contain mass outbreaks. And 70% of new cases worldwide are in Europe, Vice President Mike Pence said on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” But public health and homeland security officials say that, at this stage in the outbreak, a different focus is warranted, given that the virus has already spread throughout most of the continental U.S., with hotpots already established in states including New York, California and Washington. The virus is now spreading person-to-person, within U.S. communities across the nation. “There’s little value to European travel restrictions,” concluded Trump’s former national security adviser Tom Bossert, who called the president’s move a “Poor use of time & energy” in a series of tweets. “Earlier, yes. Now, travel restrictions/screening are less useful,” Bossert wrote on Twitter. “We have nearly as much disease here in the US as the countries in Europe. We MUST focus on layered community mitigation measures-Now!” Bossert added that if the U.S. does not implement aggressive mitigation measures like shutting schools and halting public gatherings to try to halt the virus’s spread, the U.S. could, ironically, “end up infecting or reinfecting Europe.” European Union officials were quick to slam the president’s “unilateral” decision, declaring the virus a “global crisis, not limited to any continent” that “requires cooperation rather than unilateral action.” “As you know, it’s a virus that’s gone pandemic. It’s all over the world, knows no borders, knows no nationalities,” Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told Trump Thursday. “And I think we all need to work together in the world on this.” More than 127,000 people in more than 110 countries have now been infected by the virus, with the vast majority in four countries: China, South Korea, Iran and Italy. More than 4,700 people have died worldwide. Most people infected by the new virus have only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, though symptoms can be severe, including pneumonia, especially in older adults and people with existing health problems. Recovery for mild cases takes about two weeks, while more severe illness may take three to six weeks, according to the World Health Organization. Throughout his presidency and long before, Trump has painted immigrants — especially non-whites — as posing a public health and safety danger. In his speech launching his 2016 campaign, Trump cast Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals, and he has repeatedly used disparaging language that dehumanizes migrants, saying those who enter the country illegally “infest” it and casting their arrival as an “invasion.” Trump has said he wants to limit immigrants from “s—-hole nations,” declared a national emergency to fund construction of a border wall to keep out migrants, pushed asylum-seekers back over the border and tried to dissuade people from seeking asylum with a policy that ended up separating more than 2,500 children from their parents at the border in 2018.  Trump tweeted Tuesday, “We need the Wall more than ever!” as he shared a message from a conservative supporter who claimed a border wall would halt the spread of the “China Virus spreading across the globe.” That history has prompted Democratic lawmakers to warn that immigrants might not come forward to seek tests for the virus or medical care in the face of potential infection. “Immigrants afraid of seeking medical care. It’s downright dangerous during a public emergency,” tweeted Rep. Pramila Jayapal, whose district includes hard-hit Seattle. Through it all, Trump has declined to align himself with fellow world leaders fighting the same crisis, with no global working group, no teleconferences and no words of brotherhood. “I will never hesitate to take any necessary steps to protect the lives, health and safety of the American people,” Trump said in his address. “I will always put the well-being of America first.” One nation, alone. ___ EDITOR’S NOTE — Jill Colvin covers the White House for The Associated Press.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — The top American general in South Korea said Friday he is fairly certain North Korea has not been spared by the COVID-19 outbreak that began in neighboring China, although the North has not publicly confirmed a single case. Speaking by video-teleconference from his headquarters in South Korea, Army Gen. Robert Abrams told reporters at the Pentagon that the North had halted military training for a month — including a 24-day hiatus in military flying — but has since resumed. “It is a closed-off nation, so we can’t say emphatically that they have cases, but we’re fairly certain they do,” he said. “What I do know is that their armed forces had been fundamentally in a lockdown for about 30 days and only recently have they started routine training again. As one example, they didn’t fly an airplane for 24 days.” He said they have resumed flying. Earlier this week, North Korean state media reported that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised his second live-fire artillery exercise in a week. The report Tuesday by Pyongyang’s Korean Central News Agency came a day after South Korea’s military detected the launches of three short-range projectiles off the North’s eastern coast. Abrams said that only one U.S. service member, among the approximately 28,000 in South Korea, has tested positive for the novel coronavirus. He said efforts to shield the force, including family members and South Korea support personnel, have been largely successful thus far. The measures Abrams said he has taken to minimize the COVID-19 spread within his force include requiring troops and employees to limit their movement off base, stay home if not feeling well and conducting strict and expansive tracing to identify people who were exposed to anyone who tested positive and require their quarantine.",US general: 'fairly certain' North Korea has COVID-19 cases,2020-03-13T12:58:42Z,https://apnews.com/80cee127687b12c7283bfecde9745089,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — The notes started popping up on Congress’ office doors this week. Elbow greetings only. A six-foot radius. And that’s for lawmakers who are taking visitors at all. “No offense,” read one, posted outside the office of North Carolina Rep. David Price, D-N.C. “Just makes sense.”  Welcome to the land of “no contact meetings,” where the nation’s highest-profile hand-shakers and baby-kissers are politicking during a pandemic that wields more power than any of them. Coronavirus doesn’t give a rip about who controls the House, Senate or the presidency after Election Day. Nor does it discriminate between elites and the people they govern in the bustling international city of about 30,000 workers on Capitol Hill. “We’re addressing the realities of life,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters Thursday. Thursday was the last day for at least a month that business-as-usual took place on Capitol Hill. The annual Friends of Ireland luncheon went on as it does every year. Visitors sporting headphones and green lanyards gaped at the dome 180 feet above them. And lawmakers chatted openly with reporters and tourists in the hallways.  But in ways large and small, the Congress’ traditions and symbols were already morphing. Overnight, Capitol regulars who talk and exchange gossip went from ignoring the six-feet rule to speaking at a bit of a distance. At the annual Friends of Ireland luncheon, Pelosi and Prime Minister Leo Varadkar shared an elbow bump. Security checks now required putting belongings in plastic bags to limit contact between officers and the public.  And visitors, millions of whom stop by every year and frequently share hallways with lawmakers, said they were acutely aware they would be among the last members of the public allowed into the Capitol until the outbreak subsides.  “It’s awesome,” said Beth Welsh, a parent chaperone who said her group was on the way to Washington when their school in Winston Salem, N.C., banned all field trips. As the tour guides ushered the group out of the rotunda just before it closed, she added, “We got lucky.” Sean Lebovitz, 22 and from Pittsburgh, said the impending Capitol closure moments away was “very much” on his mind as he viewed the artwork depicting the nation’s crucibles and leaders. But he said he didn’t think twice about the chance to visit while he still could, virus notwithstanding. “It’s not really something I consider to be a direct threat to me or people around me,” Lebovitz said. Shutting down the complex to visitors, a rarely-taken step, was only one example of lawmakers distancing themselves from the public and each other. One reason is that Congress, like America, is increasingly populated by an at-risk group: People over 60 years old. The average age of senators is nearly 63. House members on average are slightly younger, but many of their leaders are well past that threshold. Pelosi, for example, is 79. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell is 78.  And coronavirus has come right up to Congress’ door. More than a half-dozen House members and senators were self-quarantining after contact with people who had tested positive for the virus. Many others were instituting protocols for teleworking. Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., for example, issued a four-page plan for how his staff will work effective immediately, including prohibiting person-to-person contact. “This will not be the last time the U.S. has to respond to this kind of threat,” Moulton wrote to his staff on March 9. Members of Congress also were figuring out how to campaign amid COVID-19 without the politically vital currency of eye-to-eye contact and human connection.  Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said he had planned campaign door-to-door on Saturday and had been slated “all sorts” of St. Patricks Day events. His plans instead now include a campaign meeting on “upping our game in terms of live streaming video message and emails in real time.”  “This is a very physical and approximate business,” Coons said. “We may have to fundamentally rethink how am I connecting.”  Not to worry, said Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., a physician. On Wednesday night, he held perhaps his best-attended virtual town hall, with some 10,000 people phoning in, he said. Some were asking for medical advice, but others wanted to know what the government is doing to slow the virus’ path. “We’re going to have to interact with people more remotely,” he said. “But I think with today’s technology, we can do that.” While comprehensive records about past closures of the Capitol weren’t immediately available, the building is seldom closed completely to the public. No visitors were allowed immediately after a 1915 bomb threat. And restrictions were placed on access to the visitors’ galleries overlooking the House and the Senate in 1954 after Puerto Rican nationalists fired from the House gallery on lawmakers, wounding five of them.  In the fall of 1918, the Capitol was closed briefly to visitors as the Spanish flu spread around the world, killing an estimated tens of millions of people, according to the chamber’s historians’ office.  After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks of 2001, the Capitol was closed to tours until December. On Thursday night, the last visitors to leave the rotunda were family members of Rep. Doug Lamborn, R-Colo.  Lamborn’s daughter, Oksana, pushed a stroller containing her eight-week-old son, Oliver, who was sound asleep. “Hopefully,” she said of the Capitol closure, “it’s not forever.” ____ Associated Press Writers Alan Fram and Padmananda Rama contributed to this report. ___ Follow Kellman on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/APLaurieKellman ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — During the financial crisis a decade ago, President Barack Obama could look around the room and turn to an economist who served as Harvard’s president, a former president of the New York Federal Reserve and a renowned academic considered one of the world’s authorities on the Great Depression. As President Donald Trump confronts the public health and economic maelstrom caused by the coronavirus, his economic team has a much different background.  His top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, is a former financial analyst who was a commentator on CNBC. His treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, is a Goldman Sachs veteran and former Hollywood producer whose credits include the 2016 film “Rules Don’t Apply.” The threat from the pandemic has sent markets plummeting and created grave uncertainty about broader effects that could turn an economy Trump relentlessly showcases to one that leaves Americans struggling and puts the president’s central argument for reelection at risk.  The collapse in stock and oil prices has become the most important test of Trump’s economic leadership team. Unlike the impeachment process that ended with Trump’s acquittal last month, there is no partisan backstop that can halt infections or restore confidence to shuddering financial markets.  “We need an adult in the room to manage these issues,” said Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard economist and co-author of “This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly,” a global history of financial crises. “Obama had an extraordinary team and so did Bush. There were great men that rose to the occasion. The current Fed team in place is very strong, but they’re not central to response here. They can help at the margins.” Rogoff, who believes the chances of a global recession have risen dramatically with the health crisis, said he also worries about the Trump team’s ability to navigate the unpredictability of politically fraught negotiation. On one hand, he said that he worries that Trump could undercut Mnuchin, who is leading negotiations with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on an economic package to address the crisis. The economist said he’s also concerned that Democrats might be tempted to torpedo a deal to weaken Trump politically in the months before the November elections. Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said Trump arrived at the crisis with a short bench at the Treasury Department and has failed to appoint a permanent chairman to the White House Council of Economic Advisers, a key group of administration economists who advise the president on a range of economic policies. Tomas Philipson a University of Chicago economist and former George W. Bush administration official, has been serving as acting chairman for the council since June. “The things that we usually rely on in the middle of a crisis — usually a big group of talented bureaucrats -- we just don’t have there,” Swonk said. “Clearly the administration is further behind than I’d like, because it took until this week to talk about economic measures. They got ahead of themselves when they said they had a plan, when they didn’t.” For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.  The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 68,000 have so far recovered. Trump has moved more aggressively in recent days, meeting with leaders of banks, insurance companies and health care providers in an effort to calm market fears, so far with limited success. He addressed the nation Wednesday night and announced that he was sharply restricting travel from Europe for a month and that the government will defer certain tax payments for individuals and businesses for three months to lessen the pain of the virus outbreak. Now the administration must work with Congress over how to best address the crisis, with proposals ranging from a payroll tax holiday to large-scale fiscal stimulus. “There is no one on that team that has a real experience and understanding of fiscal stimulus,” said Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden during the Obama administration. He said he’s spoken to Kudlow about ideas to assist hourly workers impacted by the coronavirus outbreak. “That said they can mitigate that problem, because there are lots of people, lots of economists with those experiences. The question is: Will they reach out?” Mnuchin this week tried to assuage Americans who have watched their retirement savings sink by saying that this crisis is likely to have an end in sight, unlike the financial crisis. Kudlow has suggested that it may be a good time to buy stocks on the cheap.  Trump, who in late January boasted that U.S. officials had coronavirus “very well under control,” has called on Americans to “calm down” as he seeks to blunt the economic and health-related damage caused by the outbreak. “This is a one-time event,” Mnuchin said during Wednesday testimony before a House Appropriations subcommittee. “I couldn’t be more pleased that the U.S. economy is the most resilient in the world, and we will get through this very successfully.” Trump predicted “tremendous pent-up demand” will boost the economy once the crisis passes. But he also seemed to acknowledge that his version of a payroll tax cut faced long odds. Even as he called for major stimulus to stabilize the stock market and address concerns that the U.S. is headed toward a recession, Trump insisted in an Oval Office address to the nation that the economic pain will be temporary. “This is not a financial crisis,” he said. “This just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome together as a nation and as a world.” Paul Winfree, a former White House domestic policy adviser in the Trump administration, said the administration has plenty of firepower to deal with the crisis and that Trump has been well-served by his advisers. But Winfree said he’s concerned that the administration and Democrats are pushing for measures, such as the temporary payroll tax cut, that aren’t directly related to the coronavirus outbreak. “If I were the treasury secretary or leading the administration response to this, I’d be viewing this as we’re at the forefront of a demand-side shock ... that will have real economic consequences,” said Winfree, who is now an economic policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. “But let’s address the cause of the hemorrhage. And the cause of the hemorrhaging right now is the coronavirus.” Trump’s push for a payroll tax cut was met with a lack of enthusiasm even by many Republicans and White House aides, who were either unsure it was needed or weren’t convinced that it was the best way to address the crisis, according to administration officials who were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity. The president wants the yet-to-be-detailed tax cut to run through the end of the year, ensuring that workers would benefit from it through his reelection effort. Republicans say Trump’s chances at getting a deal ultimately come down to what Mnuchin can work out with Pelosi. The speaker, who spent time with Mnuchin on Tuesday and Wednesday, described her relationship with the treasury secretary as “professional.” ___ Associated Press writers Matthew Daly and Andrew Taylor contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. retaliatory airstrikes against militants in Iraq destroyed five weapons depots, but the top U.S commander for the Middle East acknowledged Friday that there are many similar sites that the U.S. has so far not hit because of potential civilian casualties and political sensitivities with the Iraqi government. Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie said the U.S. decision to target the Iranian-backed Shiite militia group that killed American and British troops in a rocket attack this week sends a strong message to Iran and its proxies. But he said that as the threat of continued attacks remains high and tensions with Iran have not gone down, the U.S. is beefing up military assets in the region. “What should now be obvious to everyone is you’re not going to be able to fire those at a U.S. or coalition base, hurt or kill our people, and escape unscathed,” McKenzie told Pentagon reporters Friday. He said the U.S. has been aware of the weapons sites and knows where more are, but has exercised “restraint” in bombing them because in some cases strikes would kill “a lot” of civilians. He said the U.S. works with the Iraq military to take out the sites, but at times that doesn’t work.  Kataib Hezbollah, the group the U.S. blames for the Wednesday attack at Camp Taji base that killed two U.S. and one British service members and wounded 14 other personnel, has not commented on the strikes, but another Iranian-backed group has vowed revenge.  The tit-for-tat strikes potentially signal another cycle of violence between Washington and Tehran that could play out inside Iraq. And they threaten to hamper ongoing U.S. negotiations with the Iraqi government to keep American troops in the country. In fact, Iraq’s military said three Iraqi army commandos and two federal police officers were killed in the U.S. strikes. And a Shiite endowment in the holy city of Karbala said one civilian in an airport complex being constructed by the endowment was also killed. Asked about the Iraqi deaths, McKenzie said the U.S. talked with the Iraq military and they knew the U.S. attack was imminent. “If Iraqis were there and Iraqi military forces were there, I would say it’s probably not a good idea to position yourself with Kataib Hezbollah in the wake of a strike that killed Americans and coalition members.” Due to the ongoing threat, McKenzie said Defense Secretary Mark Esper has agreed to keep two Navy aircraft carriers — the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and the USS Harry S. Truman -- in the Gulf region “for a period of time.” He said this is the first time since 2012 that the U.S. has had two carriers in the region at the same time. He also said that Patriot air defense missile systems are being moved into Iraq to provide defenses against ballistic missile attacks like the January strike by Iran that hit an Iraqi air base where U.S. troops were present. No Americans were killed in that attack but dozens suffered mild traumatic brain injury. Since then, Washington has been negotiating with the Iraqi government to permit the Patriot deployment. The latest strikes mark a rapid escalation in tensions with Tehran and its proxy groups in Iraq, just two months after Iran carried out a massive ballistic missile attack against American troops at a base in Iraq. They came just hours after top U.S. defense leaders threatened retaliation for the Wednesday rocket attack, making clear that they knew who did it and that the attackers would be held accountable. “The United States will not tolerate attacks against our people, our interests, or our allies,” Esper said. “As we have demonstrated in recent months, we will take any action necessary to protect our forces in Iraq and the region.” According to the U.S. military, the locations of the strikes were largely around the Baghdad region. The strikes hit weapons storage facilities in Karbala, Al-Musayib, and Arab Nawar Ahmad and a missile storage and propellant production facility in Jurf al-Sakher,  Prior to the strikes top U.S. officials, including President Donald Trump and Esper had suggested retaliation was coming. And McKenzie told senators in a public hearing that the deaths of U.S. and coalition troops created a “red line” for the U.S. Two U.S. troops and one British service member were killed and 14 other personnel were wounded when as many as 15 rockets hit the base Wednesday. The U.S. military said the 107 mm Katyusha rockets were fired from a truck launcher that was found by Iraqi security forces near the base after the attack. Asked why there were no systems at Taji to intercept the rockets, McKenzie said that such systems are limited and can’t be everywhere. He said to put a system there, he would have to take it away from another location where it’s also needed. Kataib Hezbollah was also responsible for a late December rocket attack on a military base in Kirkuk that killed a U.S. contractor, prompting American military strikes in response.  That in turn led to protests at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. They were followed Jan. 3 by a U.S. airstrike that killed Iran’s most powerful military officer, Gen. Qassem Soleimani, and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a leader of the Iran-backed militias in Iraq, of which Kataib Hezbollah is a member. In response to the Soleimani killing, Iran launched a massive ballistic missile attack on Jan. 8, at al-Asad air base in Iraq, that resulted in traumatic brain injuries to more than 100 American troops. ___ Associated Press writers Robert Burns in Washington and Qassim Abdul-Zahra in Baghdad contributed to this report.","US general: US strikes destroy weapons depots, more remain",2020-03-12T16:11:21Z,https://apnews.com/5ff9d48d1bdb2d2b1e4243d18930b159,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — Three surveillance powers available to the U.S. government are set to temporarily expire Sunday after a trio of senators opposed a bipartisan House bill that would renew the authorities and impose new restrictions.  The Senate will consider the House bill next week, after a delay, but it is unclear if President Donald Trump, a skeptic of the nation’s intelligence community, would sign it. Trump told Republican Sen. Mike Lee, who opposes the House measure, on Thursday that he doesn’t support it, according to a spokesman for the senator.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell supports the legislation and had hoped to pass it Thursday, but he was forced to delay consideration past the expiration date after Lee and two other senators — Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon — said they would object.  The three senators, longtime critics of government surveillance, said the House bill would still give the government too much power to surveil Americans. The House legislation, negotiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, would renew several provisions the FBI sees as vital to fighting terrorism but also aim to ensure stricter oversight of how the bureau conducts surveillance.  Lee proposed a deal on the Senate floor Thursday — extension of the current authorities if the Senate would consider several amendments to the House bill that would further limit them. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, speaking on the floor for McConnell, objected to that deal, saying the Senate should instead pass the House bill.  “We’re not a rubberstamp for the House of Representatives,” Lee said. “We’re certainly not a rubber stamp for the Deep State.”  The House legislation updates the three expiring surveillance provisions, including one that permits the FBI to obtain court orders to collect business records on subjects in national security investigations. Another, known as the “roving wiretap” provision, permits surveillance on subjects even after they’ve changed phones. The third allows agents to monitor subjects who don’t have ties to international terrorism organizations. The House legislation, passed Wednesday, is a compromise that reflects angst in both parties about the way the surveillance powers have been used, but also a reluctance to strip those powers from the government’s arsenal. Republicans and Democrats in the House broadly agreed that they did not want civil liberties sacrificed in efforts to thwart terrorism and other crimes.  In addition, Republicans had been aggressively seeking changes to the law since the Justice Department’s investigation into Trump’s campaign and Russia, while many Democrats already had concerns about government surveillance.  At the behest of those Republicans, the House compromise takes aim at some of the missteps the Justice Department has acknowledged making during the Russia investigation. Applications under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to eavesdrop on a former Trump campaign aide were riddled with omissions and missteps, according to an inspector general report. The measure would require that officers responsible for FISA applications certify that the department has been advised of any information that could undercut or contradict the premise of the surveillance. In the Russia investigation, some of the information the FBI omitted from its applications cut against the idea that former Trump adviser Carter Page was a Russian agent, the watchdog found.  Page has denied that and was never charged with wrongdoing.  The bill also would institute criminal penalties and other sanctions for making false statements to the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which issues warrants to the FBI to eavesdrop on people it has probable cause to believe are agents of a foreign power. It would require the attorney general to approve in writing of an investigation if the target of the surveillance is a federal candidate or official. Attorney General William Barr was involved in the negotiations with the White House and Congress, and he said Wednesday that he supports the bill. “It is of the utmost important that the Department’s attorneys and investigators always work in a manner consistent with the highest professional standards, and this overall package will help ensure the integrity of the FISA process and protect against future abuses going forward,” Barr said. But Barr’s support does not guarantee that Trump is on board. The president kept Congress guessing with a Thursday tweet that did not indicate how he would act.  “Many Republican Senators want me to Veto the FISA Bill until we find out what led to, and happened with, the illegal attempted “coup” of the duly elected President of the United States, and others!,” Trump tweeted, referring to the FBI’s Russia investigation.  _____ AP Congressional Correspondent Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.",US surveillance powers set to temporarily expire ,2020-03-12T22:14:21Z,https://apnews.com/44de4faec5e5843df9a46336411550d5,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Thursday signed into law a bill that provides $1 billion to help small telecom providers replace equipment made by China’s Huawei and ZTE. The U.S. government considers the Chinese companies a security risk and has pushed its allies not to use Huawei equipment in next-generation cellular networks, known as 5G. Both companies have denied that China uses their products for spying. The Federal Communications Commission has already voted to bar U.S. phone companies from using government subsidies for equipment from the two Chinese companies. This bill affects mostly small, rural companies, because the major U.S. network providers don’t use the Chinese equipment.  The White House said that using untrustworthy vendors to build communications infrastructure threatens national security by exposing networks to actors who are potentially influenced by foreign entities.  The legislation creates a reimbursement program that small telecom providers can use when removing and replacing equipment manufactured by entities deemed to pose unacceptable national security risks. The bill is aimed at telecom providers with fewer than 2 million customers.  “The administration will not risk subjecting America’s critical telecommunications infrastructure to companies that are controlled by authoritarian governments or foreign adversaries,” the White House said in a statement. Donald Morrissey, a Huawei spokesman, said the bill was an “unrealistic attempt to fix what isn’t broken” and will hurt local consumers. “This legislation remains considerably underfunded, will take longer than anticipated to fulfill and will put at risk some of Huawei’s customers, who operate in the most under-served areas,” Morrissey said.",Trump signs bill to help telecoms replace Huawei equipment,2020-03-12T21:53:05Z,https://apnews.com/f2846c4bb8028470ae76106749d56dc7,AP
"NEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump said Thursday that he is temporarily halting his trademark rallies — as his campaign bows to the coronavirus outbreak that is rapidly reshaping the nation’s political landscape. The rallies have long been Trump’s most potent political weapon: They energize the candidate, give him a powerful platform from which to attack his adversaries and allow his team to collect a treasure trove of voter data.  But the spread of the virus, which has closed schools and shuttered professional sports leagues, has also touched the 2020 presidential campaign. The two leading Democratic contenders, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, canceled their scheduled rallies earlier this week. The president’s reelection team reluctantly followed suit, with Trump saying Thursday that multiple events that were in the works are being postponed. “We had about three of them in Nevada, actually. And we had four or five of them of them that we were thinking about,” Trump said at the White House. The president’s campaign has suspended all rallies, events and fundraisers for at least the next week, according to officials. Trump was slated to fly west on Thursday night for events in Nevada and Colorado, a trip that was canceled after his Oval Office address to the nation on Wednesday night about the severity of the coronavirus outbreak. Campaign officials conferred Thursday to work out a plan for how to proceed while the virus makes traditional campaigning ill-advised, especially considering the higher risk it presents to older voters, many of whom support the president. Options under consideration include virtual town halls and conference calls for supporters. The tentative Western itinerary included a rally and fundraisers in each state — including one in Colorado benefiting Republican Sen. Cory Gardner — as well as a previously announced stop at the Republican Jewish Coalition’s annual conference in Las Vegas, hosted by GOP megadonor Sheldon Adelson. Trump said in the Oval Office on Thursday that he would hold the Gardner event “here,” which would have been a violation of the Hatch Act preventing political activity at the White House. A White House spokesman said later the president was not referring to a fundraiser but rather a roundtable on the Land and Water Conservation Fund, an official government event that had not previously been announced. Trump refused to rule out a rapid return to rallies, even though the government’s own health experts have advised against large gatherings of people. Events with comparable-sized crowds, like NBA and NHL games, have been postponed indefinitely. The campaign had previously been eyeing, but had not yet announced, a rally in Tampa, Florida, on March 25. Trump said he would be “making a decision at the appropriate time” on whether to hold that one, adding that he would “probably not do it because people would say that it’s better not to do. You know, we need a little separation until such time as this goes away. It’s going to go away.” “I’m not going to do it if I think it’s going to be negative at all,” the president said. “I don’t want people dying.” For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.  The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. Trump claimed that more than 100,000 people had requested tickets for the Tampa rally, an impossibility since the campaign had not yet announced the event or made tickets available. A campaign spokesman declined to comment. The campaign also canceled a “Catholics for Trump” coalition event, which Trump planned to attend, that had been scheduled for Milwaukee next week. Vice President Mike Pence also planned to stop all campaign activity for two weeks, a White House official said. The campaign’s social media and text accounts sent out notes to supporters praising the president’s “aggressive and comprehensive” effort to stop the virus spread. Increasingly focused on his campaign, Trump had pushed aides up until this week to continue scheduling huge rallies. He had hoped to use them to blunt the momentum of his likely general election foe, Biden, who offers himself as someone better positioned to respond to the coronavirus. Standing in front of a backdrop meant to look presidential, Biden delivered a speech about the virus on Thursday and announced a virtual town hall with Illinois voters the following day. ___ Associated Press writer Aamer Madhani contributed to this report from Washington. ___ Follow Lemire on Twitter at https://twitter.com/@JonLemire ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.”","Amid virus fears, Trump moves away from rallies — for now",2020-03-12T21:40:17Z,https://apnews.com/2899c377b243ecc10f920e6f5224a260,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump incorrectly stated in his address to the nation that the health insurance industry has agreed to waive patient co-payments for treatment of COVID-19. The industry has not made such a commitment.  Instead, insurers agreed to cover the full cost of diagnostic tests to see whether people have the disease. That step does not shield insured people from potentially high medical bills as a result of getting sick from the coronavirus. Trump’s misstatement on health insurance was one of a number of claims in his prime-time address  that were at odds with the facts. He inaccurately described part of his own plan to restrict travel from Europe  and appeared to hold out false hope that people infected in the current outbreak will see new treatments to hasten their healing. On Thursday, he misrepresented another aspect of U.S. defenses against the virus, saying inaccurately that everyone coming into the country is being tested for it.  A look at his remarks Wednesday night and Thursday: TRUMP: “Earlier this week, I met with the leaders of (the) health insurance industry, who have agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments, extend insurance coverage to these treatments, and to prevent surprise medical billing.” THE FACTS: No, they did not say they will cover co-pays for treatment. And Trump’s statement about surprise medical billing is questionable. As Vice President Mike Pence stated more accurately, the insurers agreed to cover coronavirus testing with no cost sharing — so no co-pays or deductibles. That assurance applies to tests that can confirm or rule out the virus, and doesn’t extend to treatment or to other tests that the patient’s doctor may order. Consumers should check with their insurance company because policies may vary on this. They should not count on the president’s word. What’s more, in the process of diagnosing COVID-19, other tests may be ordered. Insurers have not pledged to waive cost-sharing for those. Co-pays and deductibles may apply for imaging tests such as X-rays or CT scans of the chest, for example, and hospital stays are also subject to cost-sharing. Federal programs including Medicare, Medicaid, children’s health insurance and “Obamacare” all cover the coronavirus tests. Of particular importance, clinical diagnostic tests are covered under Medicare with no cost-sharing, a longstanding policy. However, cost-sharing may apply for other tests, such as imaging. When people get sick from the coronavirus, there currently is no antiviral treatment that can cure the disease. Instead, the current treatment is geared to relieving patients’ symptoms and helping them to recover. For those who are very sick, that can involve using machinery to help them breathe. Insurers cover such treatment based on the terms of the individual’s health plan, including any applicable deductibles and co-pays. As for “surprise billing,” that’s not something insurers can waive because they’re not the ones who do it. Doctors and hospitals generally spring those surprises. Overall, says Karen Pollitz of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation: “We don’t have a rule yet that says all insurers must do ‘x,’ so flip your insurance card over and call the 800 number.”  For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.  ___ TRUMP: “If an American is coming back or anybody is coming back, we’re testing. We have a tremendous testing setup where people coming in have to be tested.... We’re not putting them on planes if it shows positive, but if they do come here, we’re quarantining. There’s going to be a pretty strong enforcement of quarantine.” -- remarks Thursday. THE FACTS: That’s not true. All people coming to the U.S. are not subject to mandatory, universal testing, nor are they being forced to quarantine.  As well, his proclamation detailing the broad travel ban that takes effect midnight Friday night on visitors from most of Europe does not specify that everyone allowed in will have to be tested. Trump was probably referring to plans that are expected to be put in place soon to channel those arriving from many European countries to certain airports, where they will receive screening and be subjected to quarantine instructions, just like visitors from China. ___ TRUMP: “We are cutting massive amounts of red tape to make antiviral therapies available in record time. These treatments will significantly reduce the impact and reach of the virus.” THE FACTS: People suffering from COVID-19 or those who get it in the current outbreak should not expect those therapies to be available to them. Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health told a congressional committee Wednesday that while antivirals are being tested, “we don’t know if it works. I don’t want to promise anything.” An antiviral is a medicine that specifically attacks a virus to hasten recovery. An experimental drug named remdesivir, which was being developed to fight Ebola, is being tested in COVID-19 patients in the U.S. and abroad. There also are studies underway using combinations of some HIV-attacking drugs. ___ TRUMP: “We will be suspending all travel from Europe, except the United Kingdom, for the next 30 days.” THE FACTS: That’s not exactly his plan.  First, the restriction does not apply to legal permanent residents of the U.S. or their families when they are returning from Europe. It also does not apply to U.S. citizens coming back from Europe, as Trump acknowledged. As well, it apparently does not apply to Ireland, Romania, Croatia, Ukraine and several other European states. The proclamation released by the White House says the travel ban will affect the 26 European states in the Schengen Area. That’s most of Europe, but not “all.” ___ TRUMP: “These prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things as we get approval.”  THE FACTS: That is also wrong. The White House quickly clarified that the restriction on movement from Europe “only applies to human beings, not goods and cargo.” ___ EDITOR’S NOTE — A look at the veracity of claims by political figures. ___  Associated Press writers Jill Colvin, Colleen Long, Lauran Neergaard, Zeke Miller and Tom Murphy contributed to this report. ___ Find AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd  Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck",AP FACT CHECK: Trump is wrong about insurers and coronavirus,2020-03-12T03:31:45Z,https://apnews.com/fb47f78357ea4a29c824dd36cc206e69,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — A senior Brazilian official who attended weekend events with President Donald Trump in Florida has tested positive for the coronavirus, marking the first time that someone known to have the virus was in close proximity to the president. Trump does not plan to be tested or go into self-quarantine, the White House said.  Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s communications director, Fábio Wajngarten, tested positive just days after traveling with Bolsonaro to a meeting with Trump and senior aides in Florida. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement Thursday that “exposures from the case are being assessed, which will dictate next steps.” “Both the President and Vice President had almost no interactions with the individual who tested positive and do not require being tested at this time,” Grisham said. Wajngarten joined Bolsonaro on a three-day trip to the U.S. and on Saturday was at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club, where he posted a photo of himself posing beside Trump. A video from the event also showed him standing directly behind both presidents as they addressed a crowd. Bolsonaro and Wajngarten later attended a birthday party for Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is dating the president’s son Donald Trump Jr.  While Trump was not taking any apparent action in response, two Republican lawmakers announced they will self-quarantine for two weeks after coming in contact with Bolsonaro’s delegation. Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, who met Bolsonaro in Miami, and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who was at Mar-a-Lago on Saturday, announced Thursday that they will isolate themselves. Graham’s office said he had been tested for the coronavirus and was awaiting the result. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, demurred when asked whether the president should be in self-isolation. Fauci has been the face of the administration’s response to the public health emergency  “Questions like that I leave up to the physicians in charge of the president’s health,” he said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday that he was quarantining himself at home after his wife exhibited flu-like symptoms. He said they were awaiting coronavirus test results. The Mar-a-Lago meeting also included Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump, son-in-law Jared Kushner, Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, Brazil’s foreign minister Ernesto Araujo and Bolsonaro’s son Eduardo, who is a federal lawmaker, among others. Vice President Mike Pence went to Mar-a-Lago that evening. “We had dinner in Florida at Mar-a-Lago with the entire delegation,” Trump told reporters Thursday in the Oval Office. “I don’t know if the press aide was there. But we did nothing very unusual.” U.S. Southern Command, which Bolsonaro visited Sunday, said it has no cases of the virus. Southcom, which is in charge of U.S. forces in the southern hemisphere, is based in Miami and is led by Adm. Craig Faller. The statement issued Thursday said Faller has not experienced any symptoms of the virus and has not been tested. The confirmed exposure comes after Trump was in repeated contact with people who themselves had contact with people who tested positive for the virus. Trump’s newly named chief of staff, Mark Meadows, emerged from self-quarantine Thursday. Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida traveled back to Washington with Trump on Air Force One on Monday but isolated himself on the flight after being informed that he had been in contact with a person who later was confirmed to have had the virus. It was not immediately clear what precautions the White House was taking to protect the president from the virus. Trump on Wednesday canceled his political travel for the coming weeks, but he has disregarded the advice of medical and public health professionals to stop shaking hands. Grisham said in a statement that “the White House Medical Unit and the United States Secret Service has been working closely with various agencies to ensure every precaution is taken to keep the First & Second Families, and all White House staff healthy.” For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.  The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 127,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 68,000 have so far recovered. Wajngarten initially denied a report on Wednesday that he had been tested for the virus, saying on his social media account that his health was fine. He is now in self-quarantine at home, according to the statement.  A statement from Bolsonaro’s communications office on Thursday said that Wajngarten’s test results had come back positive and that the presidency was adopting preventive measures to ensure Bolsonaro’s health.  Bolsonaro’s son confirmed in a Thursday tweet that his father had been tested for the coronavirus and said he isn’t showing symptoms. Bolsonaro’s health has been a focus since a 2018 stabbing on the campaign trail. Since the assassination attempt, he has already undergone four surgeries with a fifth upcoming. In December, he was taken to the hospital after slipping in the bathroom of the presidential residence and banging his head. Grisham said that under U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, “there is currently no indication to test patients without symptoms, and only people with prolonged close exposure to confirmed positive cases should self-quarantine.” ___ Biller reported from Rio de Janeiro.

"JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — Mounting concerns about the coronarvirus spread to state capitols across the country Thursday, as some lawmakers halted their sessions, shut out the public and scrambled to finish work on essential spending bills to keep government going.  Even in states with few confirmed cases of the COVID-19 disease, publicity over the cancellations of major sporting events, conferences and mass gatherings added to the pressure on state lawmakers to protect the public — and themselves — from potential exposure to the virus. On any given day, hundreds or even thousands of people pass through state capitols, including school children on tours, members of interest groups gathering for rallies, lobbyists, journalists and government employees. “We feel it may be in the best interest for us not to be in this petri dish that we all show up in every week,” Missouri Senate President Pro Tem Dave Schatz said Thursday while announcing that the chamber was suspending its regular sessions until at least March 30.  Both houses of the Illinois General Assembly canceled their scheduled sessions for next week. So did both chambers of the Delaware General Assembly, which also shut down public tours of its building. Delaware’s legislative leaders said they would re-evaluate whether to resume session on a weekly basis, equating the missed days to a more familiar occurrence — snow days — that can be made up. After adopting a budget plan Thursday with $100 million for coronavirus-related needs, the Georgia General Assembly announced it was suspending its session indefinitely. For most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.  The number of confirmed coronavirus cases is increasing. In the U.S., the total has topped 1,200, with three dozen deaths. Worldwide, more than 127,000 have been infected, and more than 4,700 have died.  Congress has closed public access to the nation’s Capitol until April. But unlike Congress, which meets throughout most of the year, many state legislatures have regular sessions that are limited in length by their state constitutions. That means they can’t afford to take as many days off if they are to finish their work by their deadlines.  Lawmakers in Washington state, where the greatest number of U.S. COVID-19 deaths have occurred, were scrambling to pass a budget that includes $200 million for the state’s coronavirus response before their 60-day session came to its scheduled adjournment Thursday.  In South Dakota, Republican state Rep. Spencer Gosch left the Capitol on Thursday to get tested for COVID-19 and other possible illnesses after coming down with a cough and chest congestion. Gosch said he was avoiding contact with people as a precaution. But his colleagues pressed forward with their work, trying to complete a budget on Thursday because it one was one of their final scheduled days for the session.  While the Missouri Senate took off for an extended spring break, the Missouri House pushed up its work — scheduling a rare Sunday meeting of the budget committee — to try to get its version of a spending plan completed next week so that it also could take a break. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz recommended that lawmakers pass the most important bills quickly so they can go home for the year. He proposed saving instead of spending $1.2 billion of the state’s projected $1.5 billion budget surplus because of the uncertainties over how the pandemic will affect the economy.  Some state legislatures have chosen to continue meeting, though not in their normal fashion. Connecticut lawmakers voted to change their rules to allow members to cast committee votes by phone while the governor’s emergency public health declaration is in effect. They also postponed public hearings schedule for this week and next.  Leaders of the Maryland General Assembly announced that, starting next week, the public will no longer be invited to hearings for legislation. People will be encouraged to submit electronic comments to lawmakers instead of testifying in person. “This decision is made for public health reasons — to do everything we can to increase social distancing and do everything within our power to ensure that we can limit the risk of the spread of this virus,” Senate President Bill Ferguson and House Speaker Adrienne Jones said in a joint written statement.  The New Hampshire House, whose 400 members are second in size only to the U.S. House, has continue to meet despite coronavirus concerns because lawmakers are pushing up against a March 26 deadline to act on bills. State Rep. Judith Spang has been quarantined for more than a week because she recently traveled to Italy, where the coronavirus has hit especially hard.  Business at the Kansas Statehouse continued as almost as usual Thursday, with students acting as legislative pages, groups of visitors touring and the first floor set up with displays honoring Kansas’ aviation industry. In Tennessee, Republican legislative leadership pushed back against Democratic calls to limit non-essential legislative meetings or even briefly halt the session.  Instead, House and Senate speakers released a statement Thursday encouraging the public to reschedule or postpone activities in the Capitol. The call came after both chambers had large groups invited onto their floors earlier that day — ranging from school groups to the Tennessee Titans football coach — who shook hands with many lawmakers. ——— Associated Press writers Randall Chase in Dover, Delaware; Jeffery Collins in Columbia, South Carolina; Stephen Groves in Pierre, South Dakota; Susan Haigh in Hartford, Connecticut; John Hanna in Topeka, Kansas; Steve Karnowski in St. Paul, Minnesota; Kimberlee Kruesi in Nashville, Tennessee; Rachel La Corte in Olympia, Washington; Holly Ramer in Concord, New Hampshire; and Brian Witte in Annapolis, Maryland, contributed to this report.",Coronavirus concerns disrupt work at US state capitols,2020-03-12T21:50:13Z,https://apnews.com/ec09b65725e075b1b31cb600456ebefa,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden has formally requested protection from the U.S. Secret Service, according to two people familiar with the matter. Biden’s request begins a process by which the Department of Homeland Security will decide whether to provide the campaign with protection, though that was expected to be concluded swiftly with a favorable outcome, the two people said. The two spoke to The Associated Press on Thursday on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.  Congressional leadership was notified of the Biden campaign’s request, and the DHS secretary will make the final determination. Biden campaign spokesman TJ Ducklo said, “We don’t comment on security measures.” The move comes a week and a half after two protesters rushed a stage in Los Angeles and came within feet of Biden during a Super Tuesday victory speech. Biden’s wife, Jill, and several staff members, including one trained security officer employed by the campaign, physically restrained the women and carried them from the stage. Neither the former vice president nor his wife was hurt. The leading candidates in the 2012 and 2016 presidential contests had Secret Service protection by this point in those races. Neither Biden nor Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders had requested protection until now. The Secret Service protects, by statute, the president and vice president and their families, as well as some other senior government officials. It is also authorized to provide protection to major party presidential candidates, an authority granted after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy in 1968. The agency said in a statement last week that it has been preparing for the 2020 campaign since January 2017, with specific training underway since early 2019. The agency said thousands of agents, officers and support staff have been identified to assist in the campaign and went through training last year that included “instruction related to physical protection, threat assessments, emergency medicine, and constitutional law.” Biden, code-named “Celtic,” had Secret Service protection from the time he was selected as Barack Obama’s running mate through about six months after his term as vice president expired in 2017. Unlike presidents, the protection of former vice presidents does not last for life. The process for assigning a security detail to a candidate generally requires that campaigns initiate the request for protection. The Secret Service does a threat assessment and consults with DHS officials and a congressional commission made up of the majority and minority leaders of both chambers, plus another member. The ultimate decision on whether to provide protection is made by DHS. Some campaigns can be resistant to requesting protective details because of the additional logistical and planning constraints put on by the Secret Service’s security requirements. Last week, Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-La., said the House Homeland Security Committee has asked the Secret Service to provide protection to all remaining major presidential candidates. Richmond, one of Biden’s campaign co-chairmen, said members of Congress were “very worried” about the March 3 episode, when the protesters rushed the stage at a Biden speech in California. He isn’t the only candidate to have been accosted at a campaign event. Topless demonstrators crashed a Sanders rally in Nevada in February. ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.”",AP sources: Biden requests protection from Secret Service,2020-03-12T21:39:10Z,https://apnews.com/b3733a39038467ec65e03fb522c8fc85,AP
"WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — Joe Biden blasted President Donald Trump’s response to the coronavirus outbreak on Thursday and outlined how he would combat the threat differently by relying more heavily on global alliances and listening more closely to the recommendations of scientists. “This administration has left us woefully unprepared for the exact crisis we now face,” Biden said from his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. The new coronavirus has upended the presidential campaign at a crucial moment. Just as Biden is beginning to pull away with the delegates needed to win the Democratic presidential nomination, in-person campaign activities are virtually ground to a halt. And many Americans who would otherwise be tuned into politics are instead preparing for what might happen if they become infected or asked to remain home for weeks at a time. As financial markets spiraled, Biden sought to look past the turbulent Democratic primary and portray himself as a soothing counter to the chaos of the Trump era. Standing before a bank of American flags, he mixed indictments of Trump with his own policy proposals and the kind of national cheerleading and encouragement that he sees as critical aspects of the presidency. “No president can promise to prevent future outbreaks, but I can promise you this: When I’m president we will be better prepared, respond better and recover better,” Biden declared. “We will lead with science, listen to the experts, will heed their advice. We’ll build American leadership and rebuild it to rally the world to meet the global threats that we are likely to face again.” Biden touted “the ingenuity of our scientists and the resourcefulness of our people,” and he hailed the nation’s “decency” and “spirit.” But he coldly exempted Trump from such praise: “I’ll always tell you the truth,” Biden said. “This is the responsibility of a president. That’s what is owed the American people.” But Biden faces limits in presenting himself as Trump’s alternative. The former vice president hasn’t yet won the Democratic nomination. After Biden’s plans were announced, his top Democratic rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, also scheduled remarks. “If there ever was a time in the modern history of our country when we were all in this together, this is the moment,” Sanders said in Burlington, Vermont, as he said the current White House was characterized by “incompetence and recklessness” that threatens “the lives of many, many people.” For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus.  Sanders led voting in the first three nominating contests, only to watch Biden score a blowout in South Carolina that has carried over to more than a dozen primaries in March. Both Democratic candidates used their remarks to recommend specific policies. Sanders, nodding to his signature demand for universal health care, pressed the need for all Americans to have access to the care they need, and he called for Trump to declare a national emergency. Biden paired his speech with the release of a litany of proposals and promises, including a call for Congress to enact paid medical leave, that are a staple of labor law in other major Western economies. Yet it was the former vice president who most conspicuously postured as an almost-shadow president, willingly assuming the unofficial mantle of Democratic Party leader as he not-so-subtly emphasized one of his fundamental arguments: that he’d be ready on Inauguration Day for whatever challenges make their way to the Oval Office. Tim Miller, a Republican consultant who’s part of a movement to defeat Trump, said that’s exactly the tack Biden should take.  “He needs to be out there reinforcing his main message of stability and trust,” said Miller, who worked for Trump rival Jeb Bush in 2016. “He’s got to have a presence and use this as a leadership opportunity.” In some ways, the dynamics recall the financial crisis that mushroomed late in the summer of 2008. The meltdown further damaged outgoing President George W. Bush and his Republican Party, dealing GOP nominee John McCain a new setback and granting a wider opening for Democratic nominee Barack Obama and his running mate, Biden. But that unfolded weeks before the election — Biden must keep making his case for nearly eight months. Separate from his coronavirus speech, Biden is making other tactical moves toward a general election. He and Sanders have canceled upcoming rallies amid the coronavirus outbreak, but Biden has launched plans for virtual town halls that could become a staple of his campaign going forward. He announced on Thursday a leadership shuffle atop his campaign, hiring longtime Democratic operative Jen O’Malley Dillon as campaign manager. The former campaign aide to Obama and Hillary Clinton quietly joined the campaign as an adviser ahead of the critical Nevada caucuses, where Biden’s second-place finish to Sanders, even though distant, was the first step of his resurgence. O’Malley Dillon and other top brass at Biden’s Philadelphia headquarters have been busy interviewing former staffers to Biden’s vanquished primary rivals as they build out a campaign staff befitting a would-be nominee – something they’d been unable to do because of Biden’s lackluster fundraising throughout the first 10 months of his campaign. And on Thursday, Biden’s campaign formally requested Secret Service protection,  a decision rooted in security concerns but also a symbolic step for serious contenders. Yet amid the clear pivot, Biden and his aides have signaled their awareness of a potential roadblock in a general election campaign: Sanders’ supporters. The Vermont senator has said in many forums, and again after Biden’s wins on Tuesday, that he’ll back the nominee and work to defeat Trump regardless of his own fortunes. But four years ago, after another bitter primary fight against the Democratic establishment, many of Sanders’ supporters did not willingly follow his lead in backing Clinton.  Biden, in his post-primary remarks on Tuesday, praised Sanders and promoted his own agenda as “progressive” and “bold” in a seeming plea to his party’s left flank. On Thursday, with a broadened audience, he steered clear of those primary dynamics altogether.  The Republican president, meanwhile, after having spent a heady few weeks gearing up to face Sanders, appeared ready Thursday to accept a challenge from Biden. “One of the reasons I ran for president was because of Joe and the job they did,” Trump said at the White House, referring to Biden’s time as Obama’s vice president. “It’s maybe the way it should be.”  ___ Barrow reported from Atlanta.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says that she and the Trump administration are close to agreement on a coronavirus aid package to reassure anxious Americans by providing sick pay, free testing and other resources, hoping to calm teetering financial markets amid the mounting crisis. Final details were being worked out, but the top House Democrat, who held daylong talks with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, expected an announcement Friday. The House could then swiftly vote. “We have — are near — to an agreement,” Pelosi said, emerging from her office at the Capitol shortly before 9 p.m. Thursday. The potential deal between Congress and the White House would cap a tumultuous week in which Washington strained for a comprehensive response to the outbreak that is testing the nation’s political, financial and health care systems. It builds on an emergency $8.3 billion package approved last week and is aimed at providing additional health and financial resources to arrest the sudden spread of the pandemic and the kind of economic fallout unseen in a generation. Pelosi promised in a letter to colleagues that a third package was yet to come. The new sick leave benefit would require businesses to provide up to 14 days of paid leave to workers who are home quarantined with the virus, with the federal government reimbursing them through tax credits. The bill enhances unemployment benefits for the jobless and boosts food and nutrition programs for working families, students and seniors. The late announcement was intended to boost confidence, Democrats said. “We felt that putting together something that the American people can see cooperation on between the two parties in this difficult moment would be a confidence builder,” said Rep. Richard Neal, D-N.J., the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, joining Pelosi at the Capitol, “and I think that we approached it that way.”  Meanwhile, the Capitol, White House and Supreme Court all declared themselves off limits to the public for now, symbols of a nation hunkering down. Democrat Joe Biden, President Donald Trump’s chief rival, criticized him for playing down the threat for weeks and promised if he becomes president to “always tell you the truth.” Amid a wave of closures and cancellations, the coronavirus question got personal for Trump and some members of Congress.  Just days after meeting Trump and Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., the communications chief for Brazil’s president, Fábio Wajngarten, tested positive for the coronavirus. A photo of the president, the senator and Wajngarten shows the trio shoulder-to-shoulder at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort last weekend. It was the first time someone infected with the virus was known to have been in close proximity to the president.  Scott said he was isolating himself. Trump, 73, said he was unworried.  “We had dinner in Florida at Mar-a-Lago with the entire delegation,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “But we did nothing very unusual. We sat next to each other for a period of time.” Asked whether he should be tested, Trump replied, “I am not concerned.” White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said “the White House is aware of public reports that a member of the Brazilian delegation‘s visit to Mar-a-Lago last weekend tested positive for COVID-19” though; confirmatory testing is pending.  She said: “Both the President and Vice President had almost no interactions with the individual who tested positive and do not require being tested at this time.” GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, who was also at Trump’s club on the weekend, joined a growing list of lawmakers who have chosen to isolate themselves as a precaution. On Wednesday, Trump announced a month-long restriction on travel from most of Europe, set to begin at midnight Friday night. He said Thursday that he was considering other major restrictions, such as limiting travel to domestic hot spots like California and Washington state, without spelling out how he would manage such an extraordinary effort. The State Department issued a global advisory cautioning U.S. citizens to “reconsider travel abroad.” So far, the administration’s haphazard response and the stalemate in Congress have resulted in more uncertainty as the crisis roils the financial markets and rewrites daily life for Americans. Biden and Bernie Sanders, the other main contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, delivered their own speeches the day after Trump’s prime-time address to the nation. Biden called for free virus testing, temporary pop-up hospitals and paid leave for all Americans to help cover paychecks as workers self-quarantine, care for the ill or lose jobs over the virus. “No president can promise to prevent future outbreaks, but I can promise you this, when I’m president we will be better prepared, respond better and recover better,” Biden declared.  Sanders also proposed swift federal intervention and money to help people suffering in their health or finances. As talks between Pelosi and Mnuchin continued, lawmakers from both parties expressed alarm after what they called heated and testy briefings with Dr. Anthony Fauci, infectious disease chief at the National Institutes of Health, and other public health officials. Lawmakers were particularly frustrated that U.S. officials have tested relatively few patients. “We’re basically, in my opinion, flying blind,” said Rep. Susie Lee, D-Nev.  As classes, sports events, concerts and conferences were canceled across the nation, Trump said he will halt his signature campaign rallies, telling reporters he needs a “little separation until such time as this goes away.” Biden and Sanders said they would no longer hold large political gatherings and their staffs would work from home as the race for the presidency moved online.  The storied Smithsonian said it was canceling all public events and will temporarily close its network of museums and the National Zoo, starting Saturday. And Trump proposed postponing this summer’s Olympics in Japan for a year, too. The financial markets endured another day of alarming slides and the Federal Reserve moved to try to ease the disruptions by announcing that it will sharply increase its purchases of short-term Treasury bonds.  For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.  The vast majority of people recover. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to be over it. While Trump said all European travel except from Britain would be cut off, there were clarifications and criticisms of the cornerstone of his attempt to curtail the crisis. Homeland Security officials said the new travel restrictions would apply only to most foreign nationals who have been in the Schengen Area at any point in the 14 days prior to their scheduled arrival to the United States. The area encompasses most European countries, among them France, Italy, German, Greece, Austria and Belgium. The restrictions don’t apply to legal permanent residents, immediate family of U.S. citizens or others identified in the proclamation signed by Trump. Vice President Mike Pence said the administration is also asking travelers returning to the U.S. from Europe to voluntarily quarantine for 14 days. But some health officials, and even a former high-ranking Trump administration official, suggested Trump’s European travel restriction was futile because the virus is already widespread on U.S. soil. “In two weeks, we will regret wasting time and energy on travel restrictions and wish we focused more on hospital preparation and large scale community mitigation,” Trump’s former homeland security adviser, Thomas Bossert, tweeted Thursday. Trump claimed falsely Thursday that the U.S. is currently screening all Americans and foreigners who are entering the country, saying, “people coming in have to be tested.” And he claimed that those who return are being forced to isolate themselves, adding: “It’s going to be a pretty strong enforcement of quarantine.” No widespread quarantine orders have been announced. ___ Associated Press writers Aamer Madhani, Lauran Neergaard, Martin Crutsinger, Laurie Kellman and Kevin Freking in Washington and Bill Barrow in Atlanta contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans normally hear from President Donald Trump when he is opining on Twitter, riffing from a rally stage or otherwise improvising. This past week was different as he sat in the Oval Office with a script laid out for him to read on a matter grave enough for a prime-time address to the nation. He addressed the coronavirus crisis that is spreading germs and fear. But his words were as factually fraught as many of his tweets. Most broadly, Trump hailed American exceptionalism in health care and science — “The virus will not have a chance against us” — even as the public health system failed in making diagnostic testing accessible to all who need it. It’s been more than a week now since Trump assured the country: “Anybody, right now, and yesterday, anybody that needs a test, gets a test. They’re there. They have the test. And the test is beautiful.” He persisted with that thought as recently as Thursday, a day after his Oval Office address, when he asserted “the testing has been going very smooth.” This, as the government’s top infection expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, was telling lawmakers: “It is a failing, let’s admit it.” A review of Trump’s recent rhetoric: EXCEPTIONALISM? TRUMP: “No nation is more prepared or more resilient than the United States.” — Oval Office address Wednesday. THE FACTS: American resilience will be measured over time. But the U.S. is not more prepared than all other countries. Seven weeks since the first U.S. case of coronavirus was announced, the government cannot account for what could be thousands of additional infections because of continuing stumbles on testing. Nearly a month after U.S. health officials promised to tap into a national network of labs that monitor for flu, that system is only just getting started. Large-scale testing is a critical part of tracking the spread of infectious diseases and allocating resources for treatment. The lack of comprehensive figures means U.S. health providers could quickly be overwhelmed by undetected cases. Fauci told a congressional hearing that other countries grappling with the virus have been making it easy for people to get tested, but in the U.S., “the system is not really geared to what we need right now.” For most people, COVID-19 causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from it. ___ TRUMP: “If an American is coming back or anybody is coming back, we’re testing. We have a tremendous testing setup where people coming in have to be tested. ... We’re not putting them on planes if it shows positive, but if they do come here, we’re quarantining. There’s going to be a pretty strong enforcement of quarantine.” -- remarks Thursday. THE FACTS: That’s not true. All people coming to the U.S. are not subject to mandatory, universal testing, nor are they being forced to quarantine.  As well, his proclamation detailing the broad travel restrictions that took effect midnight Friday night on visitors from most of Europe does not specify that everyone allowed in will have to be tested. Trump was probably referring to plans that are expected to be put in place soon to channel those arriving from many European countries to certain U.S. airports, where they will receive screening and be subjected to quarantine instructions, just like visitors from China. ___ TRUMP: “Taking early intense action, we have seen dramatically fewer cases of the virus in the United States than are now present in Europe. ” — Oval Office address. THE FACTS: “Seen” so far may be true. But that does not mean Europe is being hit harder by infections than the United States. Because of test shortages in the U.S., many Americans with COVID-19 aren’t being diagnosed and counted. ___ TRUMP: “The European Union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hot spots. As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe.” — Oval Office address.  THE FACTS: That’s a distorted account of travel restrictions in Europe.  By the time U.S. travel restrictions were announced on Jan. 31, many major European airlines had already cut service to China. While restrictions in some European countries were not as widespread, others were much broader.  The Czech Republic had stopped issuing visas to Chinese citizens. Germany issued a travel advisory urging citizens to postpone nonessential travel to China. Italy had declared a state of emergency for six months. Russia had shut down its land border with China, as well as almost all train traffic and most flights there.  Trump on Jan. 31 signed an order that would temporarily bar entry to the U.S. of foreign nationals, other than immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, who have traveled in China within the last 14 days. The ban took effect Feb. 2.  A recent study from the journal Science found China’s internal crackdown modestly delayed the spread of the virus but it cast doubt that travel restrictions elsewhere will do much compared with other preventive measures.  Despite Trump’s boast of “early intense action,” his former homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, said restrictions on entry into the U.S. from Europe came too late. “We have nearly as much disease here in the US as the countries in Europe,” he tweeted. ___ WHAT’S COVERED TRUMP: “Earlier this week, I met with the leaders of (the) health insurance industry, who have agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments, extend insurance coverage to these treatments, and to prevent surprise medical billing.” — Oval Office address. THE FACTS: No, they did not say they will cover copays for treatment.  As Vice President Mike Pence stated more accurately, the insurers agreed to cover coronavirus testing with no cost sharing — so no copays or deductibles. That assurance applies to tests that can confirm or rule out the virus, and doesn’t extend to treatment or to other tests that the patient’s doctor may order. Consumers should check with their insurance company because policies may vary on this. They should not count on the president’s word. What’s more, in the process of diagnosing COVID-19, other tests may be ordered. Insurers have not pledged to waive cost-sharing for those. Copays and deductibles may apply for imaging tests such as X-rays or CT scans of the chest, for example, and hospital stays are also subject to cost-sharing. Federal programs including Medicare, Medicaid, children’s health insurance and “Obamacare” all cover the coronavirus tests. Of particular importance, clinical diagnostic tests are covered under Medicare with no cost-sharing, a longstanding policy. But cost-sharing may apply for other tests, such as imaging. When people get sick from the coronavirus, there currently is no antiviral treatment that can cure the disease. Instead, the current treatment is geared to relieving patients’ symptoms and helping them to recover. For those who are very sick, that can involve using machinery to help them breathe. Insurers cover such treatment based on the terms of the individual’s health plan, including any applicable deductibles and copays. ___ TESTS & TREATMENT TRUMP: “We are cutting massive amounts of red tape to make antiviral therapies available in record time. These treatments will significantly reduce the impact and reach of the virus.” — Oval Office address. THE FACTS: People with COVID-19 or those who get it in the outbreak should not expect those therapies to be available to them. Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health told a congressional committee Wednesday that while antivirals are being tested, “we don’t know if it works. I don’t want to promise anything.” An antiviral is a medicine that specifically attacks a virus to hasten recovery. An experimental drug named remdesivir, which was being developed to fight Ebola, is being tested in COVID-19 patients in the U.S. and abroad. There also are studies underway using combinations of some HIV-attacking drugs. ___ TRUMP: “For decades the @CDCgov looked at, and studied, its testing system, but did nothing about it. It would always be inadequate and slow for a large scale pandemic, but a pandemic would never happen, they hoped. President Obama made changes that only complicated things further..... Their response to H1N1 Swine Flu was a full scale disaster, with thousands dying, and nothing meaningful done to fix the testing problem, until now.” — tweets Friday. THE FACTS: His newfound disdain for the CDC’s actions and his criticisms of the Obama administration are based on a faulty description of what happened in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, initially called “swine flu.” Then, the CDC’s flu surveillance network actually sounded the alarm, spotting two children in California who were the first diagnosed cases of the new flu strain. About two weeks later, the U.S. declared a public health emergency and the CDC began releasing anti-flu drugs from the national stockpile to help hospitals get ready. Trump declared a state of emergency Friday, nearly two months after the first COVID-19 case in the U.S. was announced. As for thousands dying, it actually turned out that the new H1N1 strain was less deadly than average seasonal flu. But even that comparison is problematic because regular flu years are deadliest for the elderly while H1N1 was riskiest for younger people. ___ TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS TRUMP: “We will be suspending all travel from Europe, except the United Kingdom, for the next 30 days.” — Oval Office address. THE FACTS: He inaccurately described his own plan. First, the restriction does not apply to legal permanent residents of the U.S. or their families when they are returning from Europe. It also does not apply to U.S. citizens coming back from Europe, as Trump acknowledged. As well, it apparently does not apply to Ireland, Romania, Croatia, Ukraine and several other European states. The proclamation released by the White House says the travel ban affects the 26 European countries in the Schengen Area. That’s most of Europe, but not “all.” ___ TRUMP: “These prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things as we get approval.” — Oval Office address.  THE FACTS: That is wrong. The White House quickly clarified that the restriction on movement from Europe “only applies to human beings, not goods and cargo.” ___ CHEAP GAS TRUMP: “Good for the consumer, gasoline prices coming down!” — tweet Monday after the price of oil fell nearly 20% and the stock market, already shaken by the coronavirus outbreak, took an even deeper dive. TRUMP: “So with gasoline prices coming down, that’s like a tax cut. Frankly, that’s like a big tax cut, not a little tax cut for the consumer. So there’s something about that that I like.” — remarks Thursday. THE FACTS: His affection for cheaper prices at the pump is widely shared. It’s just that cheaper gas increasingly comes at a cost. The price decline could hurt overall economic growth, which is probably a bigger negative on balance than saving at the pump. A drop in oil prices is not as helpful to the U.S. economy as it was when the country was massively dependent on foreign oil. That’s because the fracking revolution has made domestic oil and natural gas production a major part of the U.S. economy. A drop in prices hurts that domestic industry. It leads to less drilling, fewer jobs, cuts in factory orders and a host of aftershocks that could leave the nation as a whole worse off. The last time oil prices dropped by a comparable amount, in 2015-2016, it contributed to a slowing of economic growth from 2.9% to 1.6%. ___ Rising reported from Berlin.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — The House approved legislation early Saturday to provide direct relief to Americans suffering physically, financially and emotionally from the coronavirus pandemic. Passage came after President Donald Trump had declared the outbreak a national emergency, freeing up money and resources to fight it, and threw his support behind the congressional aid package. From the Rose Garden, Trump said, “I am officially declaring a national emergency,” unleashing as much as $50 billion for state and local governments to respond to the crisis. Trump also announced a range of executive actions, including a new public-private partnership to expand coronavirus testing capabilities with drive-through locations, as Washington tries to subdue the new virus whose spread is roiling markets, shuttering institutions and disrupting the lives of everyday Americans. But he denied any responsibility for delays in making testing available as his administration has come under criticism for being too slow to respond.  Trump said, “I don’t take responsibility at all” for the slow rollout of testing. As the House prepared to vote late Friday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi trumpeted the hard-fought package that will provide free testing, sick pay for workers, enhanced unemployment benefits and bolstered food programs. “We did what we said we were going to do: Put families first,” said Pelosi, flanked by Democratic lawmakers, including many freshmen. The House passed the bill after midnight on a bipartisan vote, 363-40. It now goes to the Senate. Trump’s tweet of approval instilled fresh energy in the measure, all but ensuring that wary Republicans would join with a robust vote.  “I encourage all Republicans and Democrats to come together and VOTE YES!” Trump wrote, “Look forward to signing the final Bill, ASAP!” On Saturday morning, he praised both parties: “Good teamwork between Republicans & Democrats as the House passes the big CoronaVirus Relief Bill. People really pulled together. Nice to see!” The crush of late-day activity capped a tumultuous week in Washington as the fast-moving virus left ordinary Americans suddenly navigating self-quarantines, school closures and a changed way of life.  The White House was under enormous pressure, dealing with the crisis on multiple fronts as it encroached ever closer on the president. Trump has been known to flout public health advice — and was eagerly shaking hands during the more than hour-long afternoon event — but acknowledged he “most likely” will be tested soon after exposures to individuals who have tested positive for the virus. The White House physician indicated later his interactions were low-risk and testing is not necessary. Still, Trump said officials don’t want people taking the test unless they have certain symptoms. “We don’t want people without symptoms to go and do that test,” Trump said, adding, “It’s totally unnecessary.”  Additionally, Trump took a number of other actions to bolster energy markets, ease the financial burden for Americans with student loans and give medical professionals additional “flexibility” in treating patients during the public health crisis. “Through a very collective action and shared sacrifice, national determination, we will overcome the threat of the virus,” Trump said. Central to the aid package from Congress, which builds on an emergency $8.3 billion measure approved last week, are the free testing, sick pay and family leave provisions. Providing sick pay for workers is a crucial element of federal efforts to stop the rapid spread of the infection. Officials warn that the nation’s healthcare system could quickly become overwhelmed with gravely sick patients, as suddenly happened in Italy, one of the countries hardest hit by the virus. The ability to ensure paychecks will keep flowing — for people self-quarantining or caring for others — can help assure Americans they will not fall into financial hardship. The legislation also offers three months of paid family and medical leave. Small and mid-sized employers will be reimbursed through tax credits.  Pelosi negotiated the deal with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in days of around-the-clock negotiations with cross-town phone calls, even as Trump was speaking at the White House. Voting in the Senate is not yet set, with senators out of town for the weekend. But Senate Leader Mitch McConnell canceled a plan recess week and senators were scheduled to return Monday. He said he expects most senators will want to “act swiftly.”  Both Mnuchin and Pelosi, who said she did not speak directly to Trump during the negotiations, promised a third coronavirus package will follow soon, with more aggressive steps to boost the U.S. economy, which economists fear has already slipped into recession.  The financial markets closed on an upswing after one of the worst nosedives since the 1987 downturn. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.  The vast majority of people recover. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to be over it.  Trump said he was gratified that Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro tested negative for the virus, after the pair sat next to each other for an extended period of time last weekend at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club. A senior aide to Bolsonaro tested positive.  The White House physician said in a memo late Friday that Trump was also exposed to a second guest at the club dinner, “sharing the table with the president,” who has since tested positive for the virus. Still despite the incidents, the physician said Trump had only “LOW risk” interactions and testing “is not currently indicated.” Trump’s daugher, Ivanka Trump, worked from home Friday after meeting with Australian Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton, now in isolation at a hospital after testing positive for the coronavirus. White House spokesman Judd Deere said she was evaluated by the White House Medical Unit. Attorney General William Barr, who also met with the Australian official, stayed home Friday, though he “felt great and wasn’t showing any symptoms,” according to his spokeswoman Kerri Kupec.  Several lawmakers, including some close to Trump, have also been exposed to people who tested positive for the virus, and are self-isolating. Among them are Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham and Rick Scott, who were at Trump’s club on the weekend. Graham announced Friday that he also met with the Australian official who has now tested positive. And GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who had previously isolated himself after a potential exposure at a conservative conference in Washington, said Friday he met with a Spanish official and is now self-quarantining.  Hospitals welcomed Trump’s emergency declaration, which they and lawmakers in Congress had been requesting. It allows the Health and Human Services Department to temporarily waive certain federal rules that can make it harder for hospitals and other health care facilities to respond to an emergency. The American Medical Association said the emergency declaration would help ensure America’s health care system has sufficient resources to properly respond to the ongoing outbreak. Dr. Anthony Fauci, infectious disease chief at the National Institutes of Health, said more tests would be available over the next week, but warned, “We still have a long way to go.” ___ Associated Press writers Aamer Madhani, Alan Fram, Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Lauran Neergaard, Martin Crutsinger, Laurie Kellman, Michael Balsamo and Kevin Freking in Washington contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"And then there were two.  Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are set to meet Sunday night in their first one-to-one presidential primary debate  after months of Democratic free-for-alls that presaged a dramatic culling of the field since the opening round of the 2020 race.  Some key questions to look for about the debate, which takes place before the next round of primaries on Tuesday, when 577 delegates are at stake in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio.  A NEW OPENING, BUT FOR WHICH CANDIDATE? The coronavirus outbreak has overturned American life, but it is unclear whether the unfolding crisis changes a race that Biden controls with more than half the delegates already awarded. Both candidates have used the COVID-19 pandemic as a hook to try to justify their main themes, and can be expected to do so again Sunday.  Sanders has been saying that the pandemic demonstrates the need for his “Medicare for All” universal health insurance plan, along with other expansion of a social safety net. He said the shortage of medical goods, from masks and rubber gloves to diagnostic testing kits, is a consequence of decades of establishment trade policy that sent U.S. manufacturing prowess overseas. (Biden, Sanders has noted repeatedly, voted for some of those international trade deals as a Delaware senator.)  To Biden, it’s a moment to make the case against President Donald Trump’s competence. The former vice president has run against Trump from the beginning, so much so that it cost him embarrassing finishes in early-voting Iowa and New Hampshire. But Biden has rebounded in recent weeks. On Thursday he outlined his own government-wide coronavirus response during an address in front of American flags, and he introduced a group of blue chip advisers. The unmistakable subtext: a candidate who can already see himself sitting behind the Resolute Desk.  ___ HOW DOES A PRIVATE STUDIO CHANGE THE DYNAMICS? Coronavirus forced network host CNN to dispense with a live audience in Phoenix and move the debate to Washington. Sanders’ style is to speak before large audiences, feeding off their energy. Of course, he’s also mixed it up with debate audiences, most recently in South Carolina, jeering back when people grumbled at one of his answers.  “Really? Really?” he retorted, gesturing out at the auditorium.  Biden has drawn smaller crowds than Sanders throughout his campaign, but he also has shown more spirit and energy as crowds have gotten larger and friendlier. On Sunday night, the veteran politicians will meet without being able to process how their answers and interactions are playing with any voters listening to them.  So far, the debates have highlighted the overall uneven nature of Biden’s campaign. His aides have said for months that he would do better if he got a shot on a smaller stage. Sunday is just that.  ___ HOW AGGRESSIVE IS SANDERS? Sanders recently shut down a rally crowd that booed Biden. “Nope, nope, nope,” Sanders admonished, calling Biden a “friend of mind” who’s “wrong on the issues.” But will that hold with Sanders now needing 57% of the remaining delegates to win the nomination? He hasn’t been shy about highlighting Biden’s record. Sanders has cited Biden’s Senate votes for international trade deals, his participation in budget negotiations that would curtail some entitlement spending, his support for the war powers that allowed President George W. Bush to invade Iraq in 2003 and Biden’s fundraising from wealthy donors. But does Sanders only highlight differences and emphasize his own vision? Does he argue simply that Biden’s ideas such as tuition-free college for two years instead of four and adding a “public option” to existing health insurance markets rather than replacing private markets with a government system, amount to compromising before the legislative fight even begins? Or does Sanders risk dividing the party by attacking Biden as another “corporate Democrat” selling out the working class?  Four years ago, when Sanders engaged Hillary Clinton in an extended, bitter battle well after the delegate math favored Clinton, the notion of a Trump presidency was only hypothetical. Now, Sanders and Biden have said repeatedly that neither wants to be viewed as responsible for the president’s reelection. ___ HOW DOES BIDEN REACH OUT?  “Unifying the country” has been a pillar of Biden’s campaign. It’s mostly a play to independents, centrist Democrats and moderate Republicans worn out by Trump.  But Biden has reached out to the left flank in recent weeks. It’s a balancing act given that he has harped on Sanders’ identity as a “democratic socialist” and suggested that if Democrats “want a nominee who’s a Democrat,” they should back Biden. So what’s Biden’s approach with Sanders standing nearby? Biden could promote his “progressive” and “bold” agenda to coax voters to his left. He could make the bottom-line appeal about the “common goal” of defeating Trump. Or he could skip the party unity talk altogether.  ___ DOWN TO TWO OLDER WHITE MEN Democrats took the stage last June with a historically diverse field in terms of race, ethnicity, gender, even sexual orientation. Now the race has come down to two white men each approaching 80. To be fair, Biden and Sanders are the remaining major candidates in no small part because they drew more support from nonwhite voters than any of their rivals. Yet it’s a stark image for a party that prides itself on diversity. Biden, in the South Carolina debate, casually tossed out that he would like to nominate the first black woman to the Supreme Court.  Each candidate talks often about a wide coalition he wants to lead. But how might they acknowledge the juxtaposition of their own identities with the rest of the Democratic Party? ","Debate questions: Biden, Sanders are finally to meet 1-on-1",2020-03-14T13:55:32Z,https://apnews.com/a47e1dd4f28e090fb2375cab87ebc298,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Friday he will “most likely” be tested for the novel coronavirus, as questions swirled about why he, his top aides and his family weren’t doing more to protect themselves and others after repeated exposure to COVID-19. Trump has now had multiple direct and indirect contacts with people who have tested positive for the pandemic virus, which on Friday prompted him to declare a state of emergency as schools and workplaces across the country shuttered, flights were canceled and Americans braced for war against the threat. Trump spent time last weekend at his private club in Florida with at least three people who have now tested positive. The Brazilian Embassy in Washington announced late Friday that the country’s chargé d’affaires, Nestor Forster, tested positive after sitting at Trump’s dinner table. So, too, have a top aide to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and an individual who attended a fundraiser Sunday with Trump, according to two Republican officials who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss private health matters. Several top administration officials, including Attorney General William Barr and Trump’s daughter and senior adviser Ivanka Trump, also met last week with an Australian Cabinet minister who on Friday was confirmed positive. Multiple lawmakers and citizens across the country who have had the same degree of exposure have opted to voluntarily quarantine themselves and get tested out of an abundance of caution. But Trump, who has long tried to minimize the threat posed by the virus, insisted Friday — contrary to the advice of many medical professionals — that he did not need to isolate himself because he wasn’t exhibiting symptoms. He conceded that he would “most likely” submit to testing “fairly soon,” but continued to flout public health officials’ advice by repeatedly shaking with attendees hands during a Rose Garden press conference on efforts to combat the pandemic. Even so, Trump told the nation, “All Americans have a role to play in defeating this virus.” “Anyone can be a carrier for the virus and risk transmission to older Americans and those with underlying health conditions,” Trump said, adding, “We must take all precautions and be responsible for the actions that we take and that we see other people take.” The president, according to two people close to the White House, has been reluctant to take the test for fear it would project weakness or worry. Trump has wanted to appear in full control during the crisis, especially as he tries to calm stock markets amid historic drops, and has expressed concerns that taking personal steps could undermine that appearance.  Asked whether he was being selfish by refusing to isolate himself to avoid potentially infecting others and what advice he had for people who may be receiving contradictory messages, Trump said, “I think they have to listen to their doctors.” White House officials insist Trump had only minimal contact with Fábio Wajngarten, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s communications director, who has tested positive for the virus. Wajngarten posed for a photo with Trump, shook his hand and attended a birthday party held for Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is dating the president’s eldest son. Trump had more extensive contact with Forster, but the White House physician said in a Friday night letter that because “all interactions occurred before any symptoms were onset,” the White House considers them “low risk” so “there is no indication for home quarantine at this time.” In addition to his direct exposure, Trump has also had repeated contact with lawmakers who chose to isolate themselves after being exposed to people who later tested positive. That included Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, who traveled aboard Air Force One with the president Monday and found out about the positive test mid-flight; South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who was working from home after spending time at Mar-a-Lago and attending his own meeting with Peter Dutton, Australia’s Minister for Home Affairs; and Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who also interacted with the Brazilian delegation. White House spokesman Judd Deere said Ivanka Trump, who met with Dutton, worked from home Friday “out of an abundance of caution,” but said Dutton had been asymptomatic during their interaction, so the White House Medical Unit determined she was “exhibiting no symptoms and does not need to self-quarantine.” White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said she’d received the same instructions, “in accordance with CDC guidance.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advise those who have been in “close contact with a person with symptomatic laboratory-confirmed COVID-19” to remain home and practice social distancing, but experts’ guidance has been mixed when it comes to those who are not exhibiting symptoms.  People who are exposed to the virus don’t show symptoms immediately; there is an incubation period of anywhere from two to 14 days. And the CDC is most concerned with close contact, which it defines as being coughed on or within about 6 feet of someone who is sick for a prolonged period of time. The CDC doesn’t consider it risky to walk past someone with the virus or to be briefly in the same room with them. Many doctors across the country, however, have been advising those with any exposure to take precautions. And Trump, who is 73, is considered to be at higher risk of developing serious complications because of his age. The president should get tested, even if he is not exhibiting symptoms, said Stephen Morse, a Columbia University expert on the spread of diseases.  ”Anyone who’s infected is a risk of spreading it to other people,” he said. “That can be true of people who are infected but don’t have symptoms.” Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor at the George Washington University Milken School of Public Health who once served as the health commissioner for the city of Baltimore, said COVID-19 is “highly transmittable” and anyone who comes within six feet of someone who is infected could become infected and spread it, without even knowing they are sick. “We are at a time of an international public health emergency,” she said, so everybody should abide by public health guidelines, “no matter their position or their title.” Any administration official with known exposure, she said, “should follow the same guidance as anyone else” and be self-quarantining and monitoring their symptoms. As for the president, she said, “in order to be the commander-in-chief of the country ... he needs to take care of himself.” ___  Lemire reported from New York.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — Public health and national security experts shake their heads when President Donald Trump says the coronavirus “came out of nowhere” and “blindsided the world.” They’ve been warning about the next pandemic for years and criticized the Trump administration’s decision in 2018 to dismantle a National Security Council directorate at the White House charged with preparing for when, not if, another pandemic would hit the nation.  “It would be nice if the office was still there,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institute of Health, told Congress this week. “I wouldn’t necessarily characterize it as a mistake (to eliminate the unit). I would say we worked very well with that office.” The NSC directorate for global health and security and bio-defense survived the transition from President Barack Obama to Trump in 2017.  Trump’s elimination of the office suggested, along with his proposed budget cuts for the CDC, that he did not see the threat of pandemics in the same way that many experts in the field did. “One year later I was mystified when the White House dissolved the office, leaving the country less prepared for pandemics like COVID-19,” Beth Cameron, the first director of the unit, wrote in an op-ed Friday in The Washington Post. She said the directorate was set up to be the “smoke alarm” and get ahead of emergencies and sound a warning at the earliest sign of fire — “all with the goal of avoiding a six-alarm fire.” It’s impossible to assess the impact of the 2018 decision to disband the unit, she said. Cameron noted that biological experts remain at the White House, but she says it’s clear that eliminating the office contributed to what she called a “sluggish domestic response.” She said that shortly before Trump took office, the unit was watching a rising number of cases in China of a deadly strain of the flu and a yellow fever outbreak in Angola.  “It’s unclear whether the decision to disband the directorate, which was made in May 2018, after John Bolton became national security adviser, was a tactical move to downgrade the issue or whether it was part of the White House’s interest in simplifying and shrinking the National Security Council staff,” Cameron says. The NSC during the Obama administration grew to about 250 professionals, according to Trump’s current national security adviser, Robert O’Brien. The staff has been cut to about 110 or 115 staffers, he said.  When Trump was asked on Friday whether closing the NSC global health unit slowed the U.S. response, the president called it a “nasty” question because his administration had acted quickly and saved lives. “I don’t know anything about it,” Trump said.  Earlier, when asked about it, he said: “This is something that you can never really think is going to happen.”  For many years, the national intelligence director’s worldwide threat assessment has warned that a flu pandemic or other large-scale outbreak of a contagious disease could lead to massive rates of death and disability that would severely affect the world economy. Public health experts have been blowing whistles too. Back in mid-2018, Fauci told Congress: “When you have a respiratory virus that can be spread by droplets and aerosol and ... there’s a degree of morbidity associated with that, you can have a catastrophe. ... The one that we always talk about is the 1918 pandemic, which killed between 50 and 100 million people. ... Influenza first, or something like influenza, is the one that keeps me up at night.”  The White House says the NSC remains involved in responding to the coronavirus pandemic. A senior administration official said Friday that the NSC’s global health security directorate was absorbed into another division where similar responsibilities still exist, but under different titles. The work of coordinating policy and making sure that decisions made by Trump’s coronavirus task force are implemented is still the job of the NSC.  Some lawmakers aren’t convinced.  Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va., and Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, have introduced a bill that would require future administrations to have experts always in place to prepare for new pandemics.  “Two years ago, the administration dismantled the apparatus that had been put in place five years before in the face of the Ebola crisis,” Connolly said. “I think, in retrospect, that was an unwise move. This bill would restore that and institutionalize it.” Connolly said the bill is not meant to be critical of the Trump administration. He said it’s a recognition that Trump had to name a coronavirus responder just like Obama had to name one for Ebola in 2014. “We can’t go from pandemic to pandemic,” Connolly said.  The House Foreign Affairs Committee on March 4 passed the measure, which is co-sponsored by 37 Democrats and five Republicans. The full House has not yet voted on the bill.  Chabot said one of the bill’s main goals is to would require personnel to be permanently in place preparing for pandemics.  “Specifically, we need someone, preferable at the NSC, to quarterback the U.S. government’s response since that response inevitably involves several agencies across the government,” Chabot said. “Our bill would make this position permanent.” Former Obama administration officials insist that the Trump White House would have been able to act more quickly had the office still been intact. “I think if we’d had a unit and dedicated professionals looking at this issue, gaming out scenarios well before ... we might have identified some of these testing issues,” says Lisa Monaco, President Obama’s homeland security adviser, said at a recent forum on coronavirus. “There would have been folks sounding the alarm in December when we saw this coming out of China, saying ’Hey, what do we need to be doing here in this country to address it?” Ron Klain, who managed the government response to contain and mitigate the spread of Ebola in 2014, agreed.  “If I were back in my old job at the White House ... I’d be pushing to have us do 30 million tests — to test people in nursing homes, to test people with unexplained respiratory ailments, to test the people who regularly visit nursing homes, to test healthcare workers,” Klain said recently at the event hosted by the Center for American Progress in Washington.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — Coronavirus is already coloring the 2020 campaign, with Democrats convinced President Donald Trump’s response to the outbreak leaves him and down-ballot Republicans vulnerable over the burgeoning health crisis, his competency and — potentially most damaging — the staggering economy.  Republicans are fighting back by accusing Democrats of politicizing the fight against the virus  and COVID-19, the sometimes deadly disease it causes. But mostly, a nervous GOP is hoping administration actions will reverse the stock market’s nosedive, avert a recession and control the coronavirus in just a few months.  That could allow time to prevent the problems from becoming Trump’s Hurricane Katrina and defining November’s election battles for the White House and Congress. President George W. Bush was harshly criticized for his administration’s belated handling of the deadly 2005 storm, which battered New Orleans, damaged his presidency and contributed to the GOP’s loss of House control the following year.  “The economy has been his whole schtick,” said former Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., who once headed the House GOP’s campaign committee. “If the market tanks and the economy goes down, I think Trump’s whole reason for being in office goes away.”  Added Whit Ayres, a veteran Republican pollster: “The way you respond to crises can be make-or-break moments for elected officials.” People in both parties say a recession and rampant disease outbreak would cripple Trump’s reelection and Republican efforts to capture House control and defend their Senate majority. That’s an edge Democrats are primed to exploit.  “Every elected @GOP official owns this moment,” Rep. Sean Casten, D-Ill., tweeted this past week after Trump delivered a prime-time national address that erroneously described several steps he’s taking to try containing the virus. “They elected him. They coddled him. They cowered before him.”  Democrats’ first ads on the theme have only started trickling out. Yet they point to GOP soft spots Democrats detect and the emotional appeals they’ll make. Before quitting the Democratic presidential race this month, Mike Bloomberg ran two ads that implicitly challenged Trump’s ability to manage the crisis by citing Bloomberg’s efforts as New York City mayor right after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. “Trust is essential,” Bloomberg said. The Democratic-backed group Protect Our Care began airing a spot this week in Montana asserting that the state’s GOP senator, Steve Daines, “doesn’t worry” about families’ health concerns including coronavirus. It depicts a concerned mom hovering over her daughter, who lies bedridden in a hospital. Daines, who faces a competitive reelection race this November, has favored repealing former President Barack Obama’s health care law, though there’s no proof that Daines is unconcerned about coronavirus. Jesse Hunt, spokesman for the Senate GOP’s campaign committee, said Democrats are running “disgusting attack ads that politicize a disease that knows no party.” Short of campaign ads, both sides have used press releases and emails to dual over the virus.  Christy Smith, a Democrat battling for an open House seat from Los Angeles, emailed supporters accusing Republicans of “legislative malpractice” for blocking a Democratic bill addressing the problem.  And an email from the Great America PAC, a group that supports Trump, says while Trump has been “working around the clock to keep Americans safe and healthy,” he’s been blamed by “the Left and Fake News media” for the outbreak.  Such emails are often used to generate lists of potential voters, volunteers and donors. Trump has repeatedly referred to criticisms of his administration’s coronavirus performance as a “hoax.” Republicans say there is still time for Trump to tame the coronavirus and the economy and consign them to background noise before Election Day.  “If we do this right, in the mid-summer the economy and stocks will come roaring back,” said Rep. Steve Stivers, R-Ohio.  A quick turnabout will be crucial for Trump, whose presidency has featured frequent high-profile clashes that often drown each other out. That includes his House impeachment and his acquittal just five weeks ago by the Senate, which have already been overshadowed by the latest crisis. Above all issues, a feeble economy can spell an incumbent president’s downfall, and things currently look grim. Plummeting financial markets, withering 401(k) accounts, growing layoffs, slowed consumer spending and travel and the shutdown of sports leagues and entertainment venues are hardly the stuff that lures voters.  Trump declared the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency Friday, saying that would provide $50 billion to state and local governments for the outbreak. The Dow Jones average rose over 1,900 points Friday but was still in bear market territory, down over 20 percent from its all-time high last month. Trump is also poised to sign a House-passed coronavirus relief package.  But in an example of his tendency to downplay the virus and his defensiveness about the administration’s slow-footed reaction to it, he said, “I don’t take responsibility at all” for the plodding roll-out of testing in the U.S. That left the wounded economy and the virus irresistible targets for Democrats, who are tying them to criticism of Trump as incompetent.  “You wouldn’t have had a massive fluctuation in the stock market this week if he wasn’t really disturbing the confidence of investors,” said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., a former Democratic Party chairwoman. She said Trump’s “fly by the seat of his pants, cover his own tuchus approach does not inspire confidence.”   “President Trump has taken kind of malicious pride in asserting that he alone can make things happen,” said Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt. “And he’s run into his match with a coronavirus that simply doesn’t respond to his tweets and insults.”  Democratic presidential candidates have struck similar themes.  Joe Biden said “a pervasive lack of trust in this president” had hindered the response to the virus, compounded by Trump’s leaving the country “woefully unprepared.” The former vice president’s chief rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, said the administration’s “incompetence and recklessness have threatened the lives of many, many people.” Still, Republicans are watching to see if Democrats overstep. The risk for Democrats is if they “look like they are cheering for a worsening of a very serious situation,” said Ayres, the GOP pollster.  ___ This story has been corrected to reflect that Rep.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — One day, President Donald Trump boasted of “smooth” coronavirus testing across the country. The next day, he pronounced the testing system inadequate, and assailed the public-health bureaucracy, Barack Obama and Joe Biden for not fixing it before he became president. But nothing changed in that system over those two days — Thursday and Friday — except Trump’s stated opinion of it. Trump has been saying inaccurately for days that the public health system was up and ready to give access to diagnostic tests for COVID-19 for everyone who needed them. He said a week ago the “beautiful” tests were there for all in need. That’s not true. But after the government’s top infection expert told lawmakers Thursday that the testing system has been a failure, Trump’s boasts about preparedness became even less tenable.  In tweets Friday, he switched to blaming the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Obama administration, and seemed to hold them responsible for needless deaths in another pandemic. His account is inaccurate. TRUMP: “For decades the @CDCgov looked at, and studied, its testing system, but did nothing about it. It would always be inadequate and slow for a large scale pandemic, but a pandemic would never happen, they hoped. President Obama made changes that only complicated things further... Their response to H1N1 Swine Flu was a full scale disaster, with thousands dying, and nothing meaningful done to fix the testing problem, until now. The changes have been made and testing will soon happen on a very large scale basis. All Red Tape has been cut, ready to go!”  THE FACTS: His newfound disdain for the CDC’s actions and his criticisms of Obama and Biden are based on a faulty description of what happened in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, initially called “swine flu.”  Then, the CDC’s flu surveillance network actually sounded the alarm, spotting two children in California who were the first diagnosed cases of the new flu strain. About two weeks later, the U.S. declared a public health emergency and CDC began releasing anti-flu drugs from the national stockpile to help hospitals get ready. Trump declared a state of emergency Friday, seven weeks after the first U.S. case of COVID-19 was announced. Testing wasn’t the primary concern then. The huge challenge was finding a vaccine. The new flu popped up in April, too late to insert into vaccine already being brewed for that fall. Switching strains was scientifically doable but it took months to grow the new flu virus in eggs and extract it to make a second, separate vaccine that didn’t become available until November, when the new flu was waning. That vaccine delay prompted the CDC and National Institutes of Health to spur research into new ways to make flu vaccine faster, by skipping having to grow the virus in eggs. Today egg-based shots still are most common but there are some faster-to-produce competitors. And NIH is pursuing a universal flu vaccine that one day might cover all strains in one dose, but is still years away. On the testing front, 2009 does offer a bit of caution. While CDC’s lab test didn’t have the types of problems it has had with COVID-19, the agency did warn that some “rapid” tests that doctors used varied in accuracy. So far there are no rapid tests for COVID-19. As for thousands dying, it actually turned out that the new H1N1 strain was less deadly than average seasonal flu. But even that comparison is problematic, because regular flu years are deadliest for the elderly while H1N1 was riskiest for younger people. Trump’s accusation that Obama introduced further complications appears to refer to a false point he has made before.  Food and Drug Administration guidance drafted during the Obama administration called for tighter regulation of so-called laboratory-developed tests, a market traditionally not overseen by the agency. Trump says that step made it more difficult to come out with a coronavirus test. But that guidance never took effect. And if it had, it would not have applied to public health emergencies  like the current one. ___  EDITOR’S NOTE — A look at the veracity of claims by political figures. ___  Find AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd  Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck",AP FACT CHECK: Trump misrepresents Obama's actions on H1N1,2020-03-13T20:05:14Z,https://apnews.com/039fb6327915570f1d6b30c29d7f9762,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — Seattle’s immigration court will close down as the nation continues to grapple with managing the coronavirus pandemic, and several other large immigration courts will postpone certain hearings for immigrants who are not detained that often involve large groups.  The court in Seattle was temporarily shut down earlier this week over a report of a second-hand exposure to the virus and will remain shut until April 10. Seattle is among the areas hardest hit so far, with a cluster of deaths and dozens sickened. The number of cases in the U.S. was put at around 1,700 Friday, with about 50 deaths. But by some estimates, at least 14,000 people might be infected. According to a statement obtained by The Associated Press from the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which manages the immigration court system, other courts will remain open where the virus has struck, including Boston, Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco, Newark, New Jersey, and Sacramento, California. But “master calendar” dates for those who are not detained will be postponed. Those hearings can include dozens of people in a single courtroom. “The agency continues to evaluate the dynamic situation nationwide and will make decisions for each location as more information becomes available,” according to the statement from EOIR, which is a division of the U.S. Department of Justice.  There are 68 immigration courts nationwide; the others will operate as scheduled but officials with EOIR said they are evaluating and will adjust as needed.  The U.S. immigration courts  are dealing with a massive backlog of 1 million cases. There have been some delays of trials among the nation’s criminal courts, and some states have closed courtrooms as the virus spreads.  There have been no confirmed cases of COVID-19 within the immigration system, but it’s not clear how frequently tests are being performed, if at all. There is often movement between detention facilities at the border, where some migrants enter the U.S. sick, and throughout the immigration system that has put employees on edge.  A union representing immigration judges has called for a temporary halt to the “master calendar” hearings. On Thursday, Judge Ashley Tabaddor, the head of the union, wrote to the leadership of EOIR asking for more measures be put in place to protect judges and employees.  “In the absence of uniform guidance, some immigration judges have attempted to implement their own risk mitigation strategies,” she wrote. “However, these efforts have been frustrated by a time-consuming bureaucratic process that is simply not sufficient in the current circumstances.” Tabbador also called the postponements in six cities “wholly inadequate to address the public health risk” and called on EOIR “to shut down all of these large group hearings in all immigration courts across the country.” In El Paso, Texas, some guards work shifts at both the long-term detention center and the public courts where people are not detained. On Friday, guards were seen interacting with two dozen migrants for a mass hearing in the non-detained court, which sits on the 7th floor of a building that also has public offices for the IRS and other federal agencies.  The migrants have been required to live in Mexico while they apply for asylum. They sleep in a network of shelters in Ciudad Juarez, along with migrants from other countries and other continents.  Separately on Friday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it would temporarily suspend social visits at all of its detention facilities across the U.S. Officials said there were no detainees in ICE custody who had confirmed cases of COVID-19 and said canceling visitation was precautionary to “further safeguard those in our care.” ICE holds more than 37,888 immigrants in more than 130 facilities, including local jails and prisons. But unlike other detention centers, have wide discretion on who can be released while their cases wind through the courts.  The federal Bureau of Prisons also shut down visitation; inmates at all 122 federal correctional facilities across the country will no longer be allowed visits from family, friends or attorneys for the next 30 days. ___ Associated Press Writer Cedar Attanasio contributed to this report from El Paso, Texas.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday declared the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency, freeing up money and resources to fight the outbreak, and then threw his support behind an aid package in Congress that is on track to provide direct relief to Americans. From the Rose Garden, Trump said, “I am officially declaring a national emergency,” unleashing as much as $50 billion for state and local governments to respond to the crisis. Trump also announced a range of executive actions, including a new public-private partnership to expand coronavirus testing capabilities with drive-through locations, as Washington tries to subdue the new virus whose spread is roiling markets, shuttering institutions and disrupting the lives of everyday Americans. But he denied any responsibility for delays in making testing available as his administration has come under criticism for being too slow to respond.  Trump said, “I don’t take responsibility at all” for the slow rollout of testing. As the House prepared to vote late Friday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi trumpeted the hard-fought package that will provide free testing, sick pay for workers, enhanced unemployment benefits and bolstered food programs. “We did what we said we were going to do: Put families first,” said Pelosi, flanked by Democratic lawmakers, including many freshmen. The House passed the bill after midnight on a bipartisan vote, 363-40. It now goes to the Senate. Trump’s tweet of approval instilled fresh energy in the package, all but ensuring that wary Republicans would join with a robust vote.  “I fully support H.R. 6201: Families First CoronaVirus Response Act,” Trump wrote. “I encourage all Republicans and Democrats to come together and VOTE YES!” He added, “Look forward to signing the final Bill, ASAP!” The crush of late-day activity capped a tumultuous week in Washington as the fast-moving virus left ordinary Americans suddenly navigating self-quarantines, school closures and a changed way of life.  The White House was under enormous pressure, dealing with the crisis on multiple fronts as it encroached ever closer on the president. Trump has been known to flout public health advice — and was eagerly shaking hands during the more than hour-long afternoon event — but acknowledged he “most likely” will be tested soon after exposures to individuals who have tested positive for the virus. The White House physician indicated later his interactions were low-risk and testing is not necessary. Still, Trump said officials don’t want people taking the test unless they have certain symptoms. “We don’t want people without symptoms to go and do that test,” Trump said, adding, “It’s totally unnecessary.”  Additionally, Trump took a number of other actions to bolster energy markets, ease the financial burden for Americans with student loans and give medical professionals additional “flexibility” in treating patients during the public health crisis. “Through a very collective action and shared sacrifice, national determination, we will overcome the threat of the virus,” Trump said. Central to the aid package from Congress, which builds on an emergency $8.3 billion measure approved last week, are the free testing, sick pay and family leave provisions. Providing sick pay for workers is a crucial element of federal efforts to stop the rapid spread of the infection. Officials warn that the nation’s healthcare system could quickly become overwhelmed with gravely sick patients, as suddenly happened in Italy, one of the countries hardest hit by the virus. The ability to ensure paychecks will keep flowing — for people self-quarantining or caring for others — can help assure Americans they will not fall into financial hardship. The legislation also offers three months of paid family and medical leave. Small and mid-sized employers will be reimbursed through tax credits.  Pelosi negotiated the deal with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in days of around-the-clock negotiations with cross-town phone calls, even as Trump was speaking at the White House. Hopes for swift passage stalled as talks dragged and Trump dismissed it during as “not doing enough.” Republicans were reluctant to come on board without his backing, according to a person unauthorized to discuss the talks and granted anonymity.  Ahead of Trump’s news conference, Pelosi delivered her own statement from the speaker’s balcony at the Capitol, imploring Trump’s party to “put families first” by backing the effort to provide Americans with relief.  Voting in the Senate is not yet set, with senators out of town for the weekend. But Senate Leader Mitch McConnell canceled a plan recess week and senators were scheduled to return Monday. He said he expects most senators will want to “act swiftly.”  Both Mnuchin and Pelosi, who said she did not speak directly to Trump during the negotiations, promised a third coronavirus package will follow soon, with more aggressive steps to boost the U.S. economy, which economists fear has already slipped into recession.  The financial markets closed on an upswing after one of the worst nosedives since the 1987 downturn. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.  The vast majority of people recover. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to be over it.  Trump said he was gratified that Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro tested negative for the virus, after the pair sat next to each other for an extended period of time last weekend at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club. A senior aide to Bolsonaro tested positive.  The White House physician said in a memo late Friday that Trump was also exposed to a second guest at the club dinner, “sharing the table with the president,” who has since tested positive for the virus. Still despite the incidents, the physician said Trump had only “LOW risk” interactions and testing “is not currently indicated.” Trump’s daugher, Ivanka Trump, worked from home Friday after meeting with Australian Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton, now in isolation at a hospital after testing positive for the coronavirus. White House spokesman Judd Deere said she was evaluated by the White House Medical Unit. Attorney General William Barr, who also met with the Australian official, stayed home Friday, though he “felt great and wasn’t showing any symptoms,” according to his spokeswoman Kerri Kupec.  Several lawmakers, including some close to Trump, have also been exposed to people who tested positive for the virus, and are self-isolating. Among them are Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham and Rick Scott, who were at Trump’s club on the weekend. Graham announced Friday that he also met with the Australian official who has now tested positive. And GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who had previously isolated himself after a potential exposure at a conservative conference in Washington, said Friday he met with a Spanish official and is now self-quarantining.  Hospitals welcomed Trump’s emergency declaration, which they and lawmakers in Congress had been requesting. It allows the Health and Human Services Department to temporarily waive certain federal rules that can make it harder for hospitals and other health care facilities to respond to an emergency. The American Medical Association said the emergency declaration would help ensure America’s health care system has sufficient resources to properly respond to the ongoing outbreak. Dr. Anthony Fauci, infectious disease chief at the National Institutes of Health, said more tests would be available over the next week, but warned, “We still have a long way to go.” ___ Associated Press writers Aamer Madhani, Alan Fram, Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Lauran Neergaard, Martin Crutsinger, Laurie Kellman, Michael Balsamo and Kevin Freking in Washington contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Democratic-controlled House, with President Donald Trump’s support, early Saturday passed a bill to provide free testing for the coronavirus, as well as paid sick and family leave, strengthened unemployment insurance and increased food aid to ease the hardship on families. The legislation will be taken up by the Senate next week. It would require paid leave for workers who contract the virus or who care for those who do and additional food aid for the poor and senior citizens. For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, it causes more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the virus. The legislation includes: FREE CORONAVIRUS TESTING It requires private health insurance plans to provide free coronavirus testing and waives cost-sharing rules for testing provided to people covered by Medicare, Medicaid and federal retirement programs. Another $1 billion is provided to test people without health insurance. It boosts federal matching funds to state Medicaid programs by 6.2% to ease the financial strain on states. PAID SICK/FAMILY LEAVE It establishes a temporary coronavirus-related sick leave benefit paid by employers with fewer than 500 workers. Workers with the coronavirus would receive 100% or their wages if they have the coronavirus or are self-isolating and two-thirds of their pay when caring for family members. The benefit would expire in January 2021. It also permits 12 weeks of job-protected family or medical leave at two-thirds pay, though the first 14 days of the extended leave would be unpaid. In both cases businesses would be reimbursed by the federal government through a refundable tax credit. FOOD AID It provides $1.3 billion in emergency food aid for low-income pregnant women and their young children, senior citizens and food banks. It allows states to provide food stamps to make up for lost school lunch benefits if their children are kept home from school and directs $100 million of the funds to U.S. territories. UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS Workers laid off because of the coronavirus outbreak are already eligible for unemployment benefits, but the legislation provides $1 billion for additional caseloads and administrative costs to encourage temporarily furloughed workers to obtain unemployment benefits. PROTECTION FOR FIRST RESPONDERS The Occupational Safety and Health Administration would be required to issue a temporary rule requiring increased protections against the coronavirus.  ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Elections officials in the four states holding presidential primaries next week say they have no plans to postpone voting amid widespread disruptions caused by the coronavirus outbreak. Instead, they are taking extraordinary steps to ensure that voters can cast ballots and polling places are clean. They have been scrambling to recruit replacements for poll workers dropping out over fears of contracting the virus, providing cotton swabs for voters to use on touchscreen machines and extending absentee voting deadlines. Only one state, Louisiana, announced plans to postpone its primary, from April to June. “We’re definitely voting,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, said during a news conference Friday. “They voted during the Civil War. We’re going to vote.” The top elections officials from the four states — Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio — said in a joint statement that the vote will go on Tuesday, saying they were confident the elections would be secure and safe. They encouraged healthy poll workers to show up. For most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus.  Election officials routinely prepare for natural disasters and other disruptions, but the coronavirus outbreak poses a unique challenge as some areas of the country urge members of the public to work from home and avoid crowds. On Friday, President Donald Trump declared the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency. Election Day voting in the U.S. largely relies on an army of poll workers who staff schools, community centers and government buildings open for the public to cast ballots in person. Because many poll workers are older, they may be especially concerned about the virus. School closures and safety concerns at senior living communities have thrown some polling places into question. Nearly 50 of the roughly 600 paid volunteers have withdrawn in Volusia County, Florida. In that state, a group of voting and civil rights groups wrote to the governor and secretary of state urging them to extend early voting opportunities and the vote-by-mail deadline, open additional vote centers and take steps to notify voters of any changes to polling places or voting procedures. Hundreds of poll workers and election judges in Illinois have canceled their assignments, leaving election officials, particularly in Chicago, scrambling.  In Georgia, where the average age for poll workers is 70 years old, about 300 poll workers have said they would no longer be available to work in the March 24 primary. Early voting for Georgia’s upcoming primary continued Friday, as state election officials weighed their options, including whether to postpone. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued a disaster declaration but said it would not affect the state’s May primary runoff elections that will decide congressional races. Wisconsin also said it planned to proceed with its April 7 primary. But Louisiana officials decided the risk was too great. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said he planned to sign an executive order delaying the April 4 primary until June 20, describing the step as “necessary to protect the health and safety of the people of Louisiana.” Some states might be able to send all voters ballots they can fill out and mail back, but that will largely depend on particular circumstances. For some, it may not be logistically possible. Uncertainty surrounded how voting would happen Tuesday in Arizona’s most populous county after the local official in charge of mail-in balloting decided to mail ballots to everyone who didn’t already get one. Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, said he wanted voters to be able to fill out a ballot at home and drop it off at a polling place before polls close Tuesday. Fontes said he acted after “a series of cancellations by polling place locations and election worker staff” in Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix and is home to 60% of Arizona’s registered voters. He acknowledged there’s no explicit legal authority for his move, but said it’s also not strictly illegal. “Considering this unprecedented emergency situation, we need to act to both enfranchise the voters and protect public health,” Fontes said. But the state’s top election official, Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, said Fontes acted illegally and she pressed his mail vendor not to put the ballots in the mail. The state’s attorney general, a Republican, asked a judge to block the mailing of the ballots, saying it was obviously illegal. The request was granted late Friday. Maricopa County officials insist they have enough workers and disinfecting supplies for people to safely vote at the 151 remaining vote centers. In Wyoming, state Democrats have canceled the in-person portion of their upcoming caucuses and will instead rely on ballots that were already mailed to all registered party members.  “Our priority is ensuring that people are healthy and safe,” Wyoming Democratic Party Chair Joe M. Barbuto said in a statement Thursday. “Holding public events right now would put that in jeopardy, so this is the responsible course of action.” Officials in Maryland and New York have said they’re considering mailing primary ballots to all registered voters. In Ohio, which is under a statewide emergency because of the virus, a plea from the state’s elections chief earlier in the week prompted more than 1,200 people to sign up for poll worker duty across the state after election boards reported some workers were dropping out amid virus fears. One state official, Auditor Keith Faber, urged his entire staff to take a paid leave day to help out.  In Broward County, Florida, election officials were stocking its 421 polling locations with extra supplies including 4,000 rolls of paper towels, gloves and more than 400 bars of soap. “We’ve purchased gallons of rubbing alcohol and are having them transferred to spray bottles,” spokesperson Steve Vancore said. “We’ve ordered cases upon case of Clorox wipes so polls workers can frequently wipe down the equipment and wipe down the voting booths.” ___ Cassidy reported from Atlanta. ___ Associated Press writers Jonathan J.

"BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Louisiana’s governor Friday postponed the state’s presidential primaries due to fears of the coronavirus, making it the first state to push back its election because of the outbreak.  Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards signed an executive order delaying the April 4 primary until June 20, according to his spokeswoman Christina Stephens. In a statement, he described the step as “necessary to protect the health and safety of the people of Louisiana from the risk of COVID-19,” the disease caused by the coronavirus. Louisiana also postponed elections in 2005 after hurricanes Katrina and Rita and in 2008 after hurricanes Gustav and Ike. Early voting in Louisiana’s election was scheduled to start in a week. But with a large number of elderly poll workers and worldwide concerns about people gathering in groups, Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin asked Edwards to sign the executive order, saying he didn’t feel comfortable continuing with the election plans. “This weighty decision has been made out of an absolute abundance of caution for Louisiana’s voters, voting officials and the general public as a whole,” said Ardoin, a Republican.  As of Friday, the number of residents testing positive in the state had jumped to three dozen, centered largely in the New Orleans area, according to the state health department’s latest figures. The tests are awaiting confirmation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. Most people recover within weeks.  Edwards had already declared a public health emergency for the state. On Friday, he announced that he was closing public schools through April 13 and banning large events with more than 250 people. State prisons have suspended visitation, and hospitals and nursing homes were limiting visitor access. As they were around the country, universities were moving to all-online classes.  The ban on large events prompted some of the city’s biggest attractions to close. The National WWII Museum said officials don’t know when it will reopen. The Audubon Zoo and aquarium, insectarium, planetarium and interpretive center are closing at least through March 28, the Audubon Nature Institute said. Louisiana’s decision to delay the primary puts the state outside the Democratic National Committee’s deadline for holding primaries and naming delegates to be credentialed for the July 13-16 convention in Milwaukee. Current rules require states to hold nominating contests by June 9 and submit delegate rosters for convention floor credentials by June 20, the new date that Louisiana has selected for its primary. Missing those deadlines could result in a state losing half of its votes on the convention floor.  In this case, that almost certainly would affect former Vice President Joe Biden negatively, since he is a heavy favorite to score a large net-delegate gain over Bernie Sanders in Louisiana. It’s also possible, however, that Louisiana simply renders itself moot, with Biden pulling away in delegates and in position to make big gains, given that the March 17 primaries will take place as planned.  Jim Roosevelt, co-chairman of the DNC’s powerful Rules & Bylaws Committee, said Friday that, for now, the deadlines remain in place. But, he added, “We are sort of playing this process by ear.” Roosevelt said the priority is to ensure “a fair process” that the campaigns can accept.  There is precedent for the national party cutting a state’s delegates: Michigan and Florida suffered that outcome in 2008, but not because of a public health emergency. The two states moved their primaries into a window the DNC had reserved for early nominating states. ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — Inmates at all 122 federal correctional facilities across the country will no longer be allowed visits from family, friends or attorneys for the next 30 days, in response to the threat of the coronavirus, officials told The Associated Press on Friday.  The restrictions, now in effect, were portrayed as a precaution, since no federal inmates or Bureau of Prisons staff members have tested positives for COVID-19. It was unclear if any inmates have been tested. The officials said some exceptions could be made for legal visits. The plan to temporarily suspend visitation, curtail staff travel and pause inmate transfers is part of the bureau’s action plan for concerns over the spread of the new coronavirus for the 175,000 inmates in Bureau of Prisons custody.  Correctional officers and other Bureau of Prisons staff members who work in facilities in areas with “sustained community transmission” or at medical referral centers — which provide advanced care for inmates with chronic or acute medical conditions — would be subject to enhanced health screenings. Those include having their temperature taken before they report for duty each day.  The restrictions, described in an action plan obtained by the AP, will remain in effect for 30 days and then will be re-evaluated. Unlike a security lockdown, inmates will not be locked in cells.  The restrictions come as courts have suspended or delayed trials and as classes, sports events, concerts and conferences are canceled across the nation in an effort to stop the spread of the virus.  Separately on Friday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement also said it would temporarily suspend social visits at all of its detention facilities across the U.S. Officials said there were no detainees who had confirmed cases of COVID-19 and that canceling visitation was precautionary to “further safeguard those in our care.” ICE is holding about 37,888 immigrants in more than 130 facilities including local jails and prisons. But unlike prisons, where inmates are sent by judges, ICE has discretion on when to release immigrants as their deportation cases wind through court, and advocates called for vulnerable populations to be released, including pregnant women, those over 60, and people with compromised immune systems. “Although immigration detainees are in civil, not criminal, custody, they are held in close contact inside prison-like facilities. Doctors have reported that a COVID-19 outbreak in these conditions is inevitable,” said Greer Millard, a spokesman with the Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project in Arizona.  Under the new Bureau of Prisons plan, there would be no social visits at any bureau facilities, but inmates would be eligible for an additional 200 minutes of phone time per month. Legal visits are also being suspended, though officials said accommodations could be made on a case-by-case basis.  “Access to legal counsel remains a paramount requirement in the BOP but like social visiting, the BOP is mitigating the risk of exposure created by external visitors,” the agency said in a statement.  The new plan was being put into place because “the population density of prisons creates a risk of infection and transmission for inmates and staff,” it said. As part of the plan, all new inmates are screened for the risk factors of COVID-19. Those who are asymptomatic but have risk factors would be quarantined and those who showed symptoms and also had risk factors would be isolated and tested for COVID-19.  Visits by volunteers, as well as official staff travel, and training will also be suspended, with limited exceptions. Inmates will still be able to speak privately with religious advisers by phone.  Health officials have been warning for more than a decade about the dangers of outbreaks in jails and prisons, which are ideal environments for virus outbreaks: Inmates share small cells with total strangers, use toilets just a few feet from their beds, and are herded into day rooms where they spend hours at a time together. The union that represents correctional officers lauded the Bureau of Prisons’ plans, saying they were “swift, decisive, and unprecedented actions taken to combat the COVID-19 virus and its ominous threat that it poses to our nation’s federal prisons.”  “These extensive measures will help ensure the safety and security of our facilities while protecting our federal law enforcement officers that walk the toughest neighborhoods in America,” said Shane Fausey, the president of the National Council of Prison Locals.  For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and even death.  The vast majority of people recover from the virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe cases may take three to six weeks to recover. ___ Associated Press writers Michael R.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump tweeted on Friday that four major cruise ship companies have agreed to suspend trips from the U.S. for 30 days, effective at midnight. Trump said that Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian and MSC Cruises all agreed to the suspensions. He said the cruise line industry is a “great and important industry – it will be kept that way!” The U.S. State Department advised Sunday against any travel on cruise ships, particularly for those with underlying health conditions. The advisory said the CDC has noted an “increased risk of infection of COVID-19 in a cruise ship environment.” The cruise industry has taken a beating in the stock market since the coronavirus began to spread, and reports of people falling ill and being quarantined on ships surfaced.  Carnival had already suspended its Princess line of cruises for nearly two months. It said 18 ships that had cruises scheduled between March 12 and May 10 would be canceled.  Royal Caribbean announced the “voluntary” suspension earlier Friday, saying it would reach out to people who had already booked cruises.  Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., which operates the Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises brands, said it was suspending all cruise voyages embarking between March 13 and April 11. MSC said it was canceling all its Caribbean cruises from Miami from March 14 through April 30.  Cruise industry leaders met over the weekend with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Vice President Mike Pence and were asked to devise and fund ways to transport any passengers found to carry the virus. Cruise line heads agreed to enhance entry and exit screenings and establish shipboard testing, along with new quarantine standards. Some of the new protocols were expected to start taking effect early this week. On Friday, shares of Carnival Corp. and Norwegian Cruise Lines posted double-digit gains. Still, Carnival’s shares lost more than half their value and Norwegian shares a third of theirs over the course of the week. Their losses for the year to date are even steeper. The cruise industry provided 1.2 million jobs and paid $50.24 billion in wages and salaries in 2018, providing an estimated $150 billion in global economic impact, according to Cruise Lines International Association, a Washington-based group that represents more than 95% of global cruise capacity.",Trump says top cruise ship companies stopping trips from US ,2020-03-13T22:45:57Z,https://apnews.com/e0a64ec862c0f96b6e0cc44c647c7d53,AP
"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration scrambled Friday to broaden testing for the coronavirus with a flurry of new measures, and public confusion persisted over who should be tested and how to get checked for the disease. Declaring a national emergency, President Donald Trump and senior staffers laid out a new testing strategy designed to screen hundreds of thousands of Americans at drive-thru centers based around major retail chains. Countries including South Korea and Germany have been using that approach for weeks, allowing people to quickly provide a throat or nasal swab for testing without leaving their cars. “We want to make sure that those who need a test can get a test very safely, quickly and conveniently,” Trump said at a news conference in the Rose Garden. But he added that the test is not intended for everyone, such as those without symptoms. The moves come a day after one of the government’s top health officials called the initial testing effort “a failing” and health care professionals, politicians and patients across the country complained about lack of access to testing. Vice President Mike Pence, who is the leading the coronavirus task force, said the U.S. can currently test 15,000 to 20,000 patients per day, but added that the number would increase “very soon.” Health officials said Friday that a new website “facilitated” by Google would guide users through a series of questions to determine whether they should be screened. If testing is recommended, users would be directed to a local testing location, which could include parking lots at Walmart, Target, Walgreen’s and other major chains. People will be able to log on to the screening website later to view test results, according to the administration. Verily, a health care company under Google, confirmed that it is working to “help triage” people for screening and said the effort will first launch in the San Francisco Bay area. The company offered no details about what the tool would look like or when it would launch. The administration’s coordinator for the virus response acknowledged growing scrutiny of the government’s testing effort. “I understand a lot of this behind-the-scenes action over the last couple of weeks was invisible to the press and the American people,” said Dr. Deborah Birx, a government researcher and health official. For weeks, public health experts have warned that the U.S. testing effort is being stymied by the limited number of labs running the COVID-19 tests and confusion among health care workers over who can be tested. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tells people to seek testing if they have certain symptoms of the flu-like illness caused by the coronavirus – fever, cough and trouble breathing – and if they have traveled recently to a coronavirus outbreak area or have been in close contact with someone who’s been infected. Ultimately, it’s up to the doctor to decide who should get tested. In many states, health officials have parroted the CDC guidance when telling doctors who to test. But in some states, officials have varied a bit, depending on a range of factors, including availability of tests and whether the virus is known to be spreading there. A New York man said he ran into hurdles trying to get tested after the death of a business associate who was infected with the coronavirus. Joseph Faraldo said he began feeling ill earlier this month and tested negative for the flu. He said he called the state health department and “they were useless,” and then the city health department failed to call him back as promised.  His doctor sent him to a clinic where he was tested Wednesday. He expects results Friday. “I think I was pretty lucky, they told me come on in,” Faraldo said. Oklahoma used more than half of the state’s testing capacity Wednesday to test 58 members of the Utah Jazz basketball organization after player Rudy Gobert tested positive. Those tests results showed one other player, Donovan Mitchell, also tested positive. Oklahoma state epidemiologist Laurence Burnsed said it would have been too risky to transport the team back to Utah for testing without knowing who might be positive. The CDC also tells doctors to give priority to the elderly or those who have health conditions that make them more vulnerable to COVID-19, which can cause pneumonia. Doctors are supposed to prioritize medical workers or others who have been in contact with a confirmed case. The agency recommends people be tested for flu, to rule that out, because many of the symptoms are similar and it is flu season. Meanwhile, some researchers are trying to estimate how many Americans are actually infected. Earlier research suggests that for every documented, confirmed case, seven or more people are infected but not diagnosed, said Jeffrey Shaman, a Columbia University scientist noted for his work on flu predictions. That suggests there could be 14,000 or more infected people in the United States right now, he said. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. The vast majority of people recover from COVID-19 in a couple of weeks. The U.S. testing effort has been hobbled by a series of delays, including flaws with the testing kits first distributed by the federal government and bureaucratic hurdles that held up testing by private labs at hospitals, universities and testing chains. Public health labs across the country are now running the tests, and large commercial labs like LabCorp and Quest are ramping up too. Broad-scale testing is a critical part of tracking and containing viral outbreaks. Responding to complaints, the Trump administration named a testing “czar” at the Department of Health and Human Services. Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for health, will be responsible for coordinating between the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration, as well as private labs and state and local government. Medicare also announced it will pay about $36 for the CDC coronavirus test and around $51 for tests from other providers. Private insurers have said they would cover the tests. Swiss medical company Roche received emergency approval from the FDA to run coronavirus tests on its automated, high-volume testing system. The approval is expected to help U.S. labs dramatically increase their testing capacity, although Roche’s system is mainly available at large health facilities. Roche said the test takes about 3 1/2 hours to run and can deliver as many as 4,000 results per day. Currently most U.S. labs are testing using a manual method that involves mixing chemicals and processing small batches. Testing times vary by lab and can range from four to eight hours. Separately, the FDA posted on Twitter that labs having problems getting supplies for collecting patient samples for testing should call the agency’s toll-free information hotline. “The demand is very high,” said Dr. Bobbi Pritt, a pathologist and lab director at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. “There are going to be shortages at first before we can really ramp this up.” Hospitals and other health systems will have to prioritize testing for patients who truly need it, versus those who may be worried but don’t have symptoms, Pritt said. ___ Associated Press writers Mike Stobbe in New York and Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar in Washington contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump, a self-described germaphobe, can’t seem to stop shaking hands -- even in the midst of this coronavirus pandemic. Trump was surrounded by several retail and health care industry executives on Friday as he announced he was declaring the virus outbreak a national emergency.  One by one, the president invited them to the lectern at the Rose Garden press conference to say a few words. He also shook several of their hands. Public health officials have told Americans to avoid handshakes, as a key social distancing measure, to try to limit the spread of the virus.  But Trump, who acknowledges he tried to avoid shaking hands before jumping into politics, now seems to have a hard time not putting his hand out for a greeting. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon appeared to be moving away from Trump after saying a few words. But then Trump put out his hand for a handshake and McMillon obliged. Walgreens President Richard Ashworth and Trump shared a hearty handshake before he walked away. Thomas Moriarty, executive vice president at CVS Health, also gave the president a handshake. Bruce Greenstein, executive vice president and chief strategy and innovation officer at in-home healthcare services company LHC Group, threw the president for a curve. He extended his forearm for an elbow bump. Trump initially stuck out his hand but then shifted to accommodate. “Okay, I like that,” Trump said. “That’s good.”","Despite coronavirus, Trump keeps shaking hands",2020-03-13T22:36:51Z,https://apnews.com/f3fdd5625c06223426856ee3260a723b,AP
"BOSTON (AP) — A growing number of U.S. colleges are canceling or curtailing graduation ceremonies amid fears that the coronavirus pandemic will stretch into spring, with some schools exploring “virtual” alternatives or planning to reschedule commencements.  As students on other campuses await decisions, some are organizing their own unofficial celebrations as they brace for the worst. The University of Michigan on Friday canceled all spring graduation events and other large campus gatherings. In a message to students, President Mark Schlissel said he knew it was disappointing but added that school officials are “looking at ways to celebrate 2020 graduates in the future.” Others canceling graduation ceremonies include Brigham Young University, Grinnell College, West Texas A&M, Grambling State and the Savannah College of Art and Design. Dozens of others say it’s too early to decide, leaving families uncertain about whether to book flights and hotels, and students wondering whether to purchase caps and gowns for the walk across the stage. Graduation decisions are being made at the same time colleges scramble to move instruction online and send students home, a shift happening at dozens of schools in an attempt to curb spread of the virus. Students have been abruptly dismissed at schools from Harvard to the University of Alaska, and many schools say they shouldn’t plan to return this term. At Grinnell College, officials told students to leave by March 23 and said there will be no “traditional” graduation ceremony. Instead, the private school of 1,700 in Iowa is mulling how it could honor graduating seniors in an online ceremony. Officials are also debating whether to bring seniors back in 2021 and host a ceremony for two classes at once. “We want to be celebrate and cherish our students,” said Anne Harris, the college’s dean and vice president for academic affairs. “But we were following the logic: If we’re sending everybody out, why would we bring everybody back in?” Grambling State, a historically black university in Louisiana, announced Friday that seniors will get diplomas mailed to them and can participate in a future ceremony. Some students say they understand the need for caution but would feel robbed if they missed a milestone that they spent years working to reach. At Wesleyan University in Connecticut, which is still weighing options, senior Melisa Olgun said commencement is a celebration not only of her college career but also the sacrifices that her parents, immigrants from Turkey, made to get her there. Olgun is the first in her family to graduate from a U.S. university and wants her mother to see her accept her diploma. “This diploma is not just for myself. It’s for my family, it’s for my parents,” Olgun said. “That ability to stand on that stage, to do that, is something I’ve been thinking of and dreaming of since I was a young girl.” Still, she feels conflicted about a possible cancellation. “On one hand I’m very sad, but I also acknowledge the seriousness of the situation and I’m trying to be rational and understanding about that,” she said. Officials at Cornell University said they still hope to host their traditional ceremony but don’t know if it will be possible. Florida International University told students that events are expected to proceed but said officials are also working on “possible alternative plans.” Vanderbilt University says it plans to host spring exercises but “will continue to evaluate that decision.” On other campuses, as students wonder if their ceremonies will be canceled, some are planning impromptu events of their own.  At Wellesley College, a women’s school near Boston, seniors are planning an “unofficial graduation” where students will be able to announce their names and majors to be recognized by classmates. They say it’s important for low-income students and others who might not be able to return even if the spring event continues. But they’re also working to keep attendance below 250, following a state order barring events of that size or larger. Similar celebrations were organized at Smith College and Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts, along with the University of Maine. But at Michigan, the president discouraged gatherings and asked students to “limit interactions in groups,” saying they should practice social distancing even in smaller groups. The coronavirus has infected around 128,000 people worldwide and killed over 4,700. The death toll in the U.S. climbed to 39, with over 1,300 infections. For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illnesses, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the virus in a matter of weeks. Schools say they’re following the advice of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention and state health officials who are recommending against mass gatherings as the virus spreads. Governors in some states have called for limits on large events. But schools say it’s hard to forecast where things will stand in two months, and some say it would be premature to cancel. Some colleges, however, said they’re canceling now so they don’t force parents to scuttle their plans at the last minute. Berea College in Kentucky was among the first to cancel graduation, telling students it would be rescheduled “to a date when such a gathering can be conducted safely.” Officials said they were erring on the side of caution but still want to honor graduating seniors. “They’ve worked hard and we want to recognize all that they’ve accomplished. But we want to do that in a way that protects them and doesn’t jeopardize their safety,” said Tim Jordan, a school spokesman. Canceling commencement can carry financial implications for schools. Some spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on ceremonies featuring celebrity speakers, dining spreads and other displays of pomp and circumstance. At the University of Michigan, students were expecting to hear a keynote address from former Vice President Al Gore. Some, including Tulane University, are already announcing that, in case of a cancellation, students will be refunded for their regalia purchases. At the Florida Institute of Technology, officials are scaling back graduation without eliminating it entirely. The school’s spring ceremony will be broken into several smaller events, with only students allowed to attend. Families will be able to watch online, and graduates can return for future exercises in the fall or summer. Some students at California State University, Sacramento, were disappointed to hear that certain graduation events had been canceled even before campus classes were suspended. The school said it hasn’t made a decision about commencement but called off other activities, including hooding ceremonies and cultural celebrations. It’s rare but not unprecedented for colleges to cancel graduations. Universities across the nation scrapped ceremonies in 1970 amid protests over the Vietnam War. More recently, ceremonies in Florida and Texas have been halted amid dangerous storms, but they were later rescheduled. At Harvard University, which has yet to make a decision, senior Tom Osborn is now wondering whether his family from Migori, Kenya, should cancel their plans to visit for graduation. The school, which is sending students home this week, said officials are “working on contingency plans” even though it’s too soon to make a call. “It was going to be my family’s first time to campus. They were all excited,” said Osborn, who is studying psychology. “It’s unfortunate. I hope things will still work out.” ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) — Bernie Sanders acknowledged Friday that fears about the spread of coronavirus have damaged his ability to leverage large rallies into support at the polls, and suggested that future Democratic presidential primary voting should be delayed if health officials deem doing so appropriate.  “We do more rallies than anybody else, and (they’re) often very well attended. I love to do them,” the senator told reporters at a hotel in his home state of Vermont. “This coronavirus has obviously impacted our ability to communicate with people in the traditional way that we do. That’s hurting.” Thousands of people gathering to hear him speak has defined Sanders since he first sought the White House in 2016. But the practice has been curtailed as health officials attempt to slow the virus’ spread. Instead, Sanders has convened the media three straight days to blast the Trump administration for what he calls its inadequate response and warn of dire upcoming health and economic effects.  “If this isn’t a red flag for the current dysfunctional and wasteful health care system, frankly I don’t know what is,” Sanders said, advocating for his signature “Medicare for All” plan that would provide, universal, government-funded health care. Despite conceding that he’s badly trailing Joe Biden in amassing the number of delegates needed to secure their party’s presidential nomination, Sanders has given no indication he’ll drop out of the presidential race. He’s vowed to grill the former vice president on issues like expanding health coverage, combating climate change, reducing college debt and overhauling a biased criminal justice system during a debate Sunday night.  In the meantime, though, the race could be shifting around both candidates. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards was planning to delay his state’s April 4 primary until June 20.  Even though the four states set to vote in the next round of primaries on Tuesday — Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio — all said they have no plans for postponement, Sanders was asked about more disruptions and didn’t dismiss the idea. He called elections “the bedrock of our democracy” and said they shouldn’t be delayed “on a wily-nilly basis.” But he also noted that everything from the NBA season to Broadway musicals had been disrupted to avoid large crowds coming together, adding, “I don’t think there’s anybody out there, no matter what your political view may be, who wants to see people become infected because they are voting.” “Rescheduling elections is not something we do lightly or should do lightly,” Sanders said, adding that state health and elected officials would have to balance that with the fact that it’s “also important to make sure that everybody who wants to vote has the right to vote, and that may not be the case now.” Biden, who has also canceled scheduled events amid the coronavirus outbreak, is holding a virtual town hall via Facebook on Friday. Sanders said, in lieu of rallies, he plans to communicate with supporters via social media and internet livestream, like he did when addressing reporters Friday.  “We are figuring out a way as to how we can best communicate with people,” Sanders said “which will certainly, in a very strong way, utilize our social media capabilities.” ___ Eds: Weissert reported from Washington.

"CHICAGO (AP) — Things were gloomy inside Elizabeth Warren’s Illinois campaign headquarters the day after Super Tuesday, where it had become clear the Massachusetts senator’s presidential bid was coming to an end. Staff in Chicago “floated around like ghosts” and tried to figure out what the roughly 40 people showing up for that night’s phone bank should tell voters, organizer Cat Valdez recalled. Another staffer came up with an idea: They would make calls for Marie Newman, a progressive trying to unseat Chicago-area Rep. Dan Lipinski, a staunch abortion opponent and one of the most conservative Democrats in Congress. By the end of the night the Warren team had made about 4,000 calls, some of them through tears. “We all had this frenetic energy of ‘We have to do something,’” Valdez said. “It was something that was so comforting.”  Warren volunteers aren’t the only ones looking for a bright spot for the women’s movement and turning their eyes to Newman. For many women’s groups and female voters, her rematch with Lipinski is no longer just a chance to oust an incumbent they oppose but has become a moment to prove their 2018 surge still has power.  “The stakes in this race couldn’t be clearer,” said Mairead Lynn, who has been on the ground in Illinois for Emily’s List, which supports female candidates and abortion rights and is backing Newman. “Since 2016, women have stood up and fought back against extreme anti-women politicians and that’s exactly what’s going to happen” in Illinois’ 3rd district.  Women’s groups have reason to feel deflated. Following several years of historic gains for women — including a record six women running for president — Warren was the last of the major female candidates to quit the race when she dropped out the day after the Chicago phone bank. It’s now a contest between two 70-something white men, former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, and Sanders, the more progressive of the two, has slipped behind.  Meanwhile, progressive candidate Jessica Cisneros of Texas, a 26-year-old immigration attorney who was trying to unseat conservative Democratic U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, lost her primary race. So did Cristina Tzintzun Ramirez, who lost the Democratic primary for Senate in Texas to M.J. Hegar, the establishment-backed candidate who will take on incumbent GOP Sen. John Cornyn. Both Newman and Cisneros were among the candidates affected when party leaders and House Democrats’ campaign arm announced last year that it wouldn’t do business with any outside companies or vendors that worked for a primary challenger. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee move angered progressives like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, who defeated an incumbent congressman in 2018. They called the “blacklist” divisive and said it would stifle efforts to elect more women, make Congress more diverse and reflect the changing views of the Democratic electorate. Newman, who came within 2 points of defeating Lipinski in 2018, has said she lost vendors early in her campaign because of the rule. But her campaign has been buoyed by support from other groups, including a PAC that Ocasio Cortez created to help progressive challengers and abortion rights advocates like Emily’s List, NARAL Pro-Choice America and Planned Parenthood Votes. She also has endorsements from Warren, Sanders, Sens. Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot. Lipinski first took office after his father, who held the seat for over two decades, stepped down after the 2004 primary. That allowed Democratic party leaders to put the younger Lipinski on the ballot in his place. The heavily Democratic district includes working-class neighborhoods on Chicago’s southwest side — where Lipinski has had strong support, particularly from fellow Catholics — and stretches into suburban areas. While it’s historically been a socially conservative area, it’s gotten younger and more diverse, with Hispanics now making up about one-third of the population. In 2016 the district supported Sanders over Hillary Clinton for president.  Lipinski, who is Illinois’ senior member on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, argues that he’s delivered for the district. He’s criticized Newman for trying to make abortion a “lightning rod issue” and using it to attract contributions from groups that support abortion rights. It’s not what voters in the district want to talk about, said Lipinski campaign spokeswoman Sally Daly.  “They are asking him about issues like healthcare and prescription drug costs, what he is doing to help protect social security and what is being done to ease traffic congestion and improve train service in their communities,” Daly said.  Newman, who supports “Medicare for All” and abortion rights, said her views are more in line with the changing district, which she says has moved more to the left under President Donald Trump. “This is a real clear choice for people,” Newman said. “They understand that they can have a real Democrat with a real plan, with real specifics and actionable items around health care and immigration, and working families issues like pay leave. universal childcare, empowering unions. They see that I have real ideas instead of platitudes.” Prior to 2018, Lipinski’s toughest races were his first two primaries, which he won with just over half of the vote, with other votes split between two other candidates in 2006 and three others in 2008. This year there are also two other candidates in the race, both first-timers who have raised considerably less money than Newman or Lipinski.  Rush Darwish is a Palestinian American who has raised money from Arab American communities and has amped up his attacks on Newman in recent days. Charles Hughes is a union mechanic who once was a precinct captain for Lipinski’s father.

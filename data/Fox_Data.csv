,"                          Former Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren asked whether gender doomed her 2020 campaign; reaction on 'The Five.' Sen. Elizabeth Warren was the last major female candidate running in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. And with the suspension of the populist Massachusetts senator's White House bid on Thursday, Democratic women across the country are feeling dejected. “The emotions would vary from anger to resignation to determination among women about the fact that there’s no women left in the race,” Kathy Sullivan – the longtime Democratic National Committee member from New Hampshire -- told Fox News. WARREN VOWS TO SPEAK OUT ON SEXISM IN THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL RACE Sullivan – who had endorsed Warren – said the lack of any remaining women candidates (other than Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who’s considered an extreme longshot to win the nomination) is glaring – “especially in light of all the gains women made in the 2018 elections.” Democratic strategist Meredith Kelly -- who worked for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand before running communications for Gillibrand’s 2020 presidential campaign – emphasized that “there’s definitely a lot of women right now who are feeling pretty disappointed after Elizabeth Warren dropped out.” “Whether or not you supported Warren specifically, she represents the culmination of a long year for the many talented female candidates running for president and she obviously was the last serious female candidate to drop out,” Kelly said. As she announced she was dropping out on Thursday, Warren lamented that a field that was once the most diverse in presidential campaign history is now down to essentially two older white men: former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. “One of the hardest parts of this is… all those little girls who going to have to wait four more years” for a female in the White House, the senator said as she choked up. Even more consequential than this immediate dejection is the possibility that with a 77-year old Biden or a 78-year old Sanders facing off against a 73-year old President Trump in November, there could be a lack of interest on the part of female, younger, and minority voters. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN But Kelly isn’t worried about a drop-off from younger voters and women, and she pointed to the Republican incumbent in the White House and the motivating factor for such voters. “I don’t think anything is more unifying for Democrats than beating Donald Trump, and I don’t think there will be a problem unifying and rally support behind whoever the nominee is,” she stressed. Sullivan agreed, predicting that “I don’t think it depresses the vote on the part of women because women really understand and get the fact that four more years of Donald Trump would be disastrous for not just women but for the country as a whole… I think women will turn out in large numbers.” The veteran Democratic Party member said her advice to women who are feeling dejected right now is “go in and mourn for a couple of days but then snap out of it because this is too important. There are a lot of people who are being hurt by the Trump administration and the only way to resolve that is to kick him out of the White House.” Manny Espitia – a New Hampshire state lawmaker and activist who served as a top adviser in Julian Castro’s unsuccessful presidential campaign – also spotlighted that concerns about Trump will motivate those currently depressed to go out and vote in November. But he thought that those who are anything but pleased with an old white man as the Democratic Party’s standard-bearer may concentrate their efforts lower down on the November ballot. “We also have the opportunity to focus on down-ballot races – it’s a really good opportunity for people to look beyond the top of the ticket as well,” Espitia noted. Having an old white man as the party’s nominee also amplifies the already consequential pick for a running mate. “The choice of vice president is very important based on age alone,” Sullivan said. But she emphasized that “I think it’s important that we show to the country that the Democratic Party is open and welcoming to a wide variety of people and not just to white men. I think that’s important.” And Kelly stressed that “I think it is essential for either Biden or Sanders to have a female vice president and that is not some sort of consolation prize. It’s actually very important so that the women around the country can have more trust in their candidacy and in their eventual administration.” “More than 50 percent of the electorate are women and we want a ticket that understands the value of Planned Parenthood,” Kelly added. “We want a ticket that has the shared experience of the pay gap. And I think whether it’s Biden or Sanders, it is non-negotiable that they have a female vice president on the ticket with them.”    ",         Will female,,         2020-03-06T114556-0500,,,https://foxnews.com/politics/will-female-youth-and-minority-voters-lose-interest-in-2020-as-race-comes-down-to-3-white-septuagenarians,Fox

President Trump on Friday toured devastated parts of Tennessee that were hit by tornadoes this week and suffered dozens of deaths and many more injuries. ""This is real devastation like you’ll hopefully never see again,"" the president said, as he surveyed damage in the city of Cookeville, praising the rebuilding that was already underway. NASHVILLE TORNADO LEAVES SEVERAL DEAD AS SEVERE WEATHER STRIKES TENNESSEE Trump, wearing a Keep America Great hat, was greeted by state and local officials after landing in Nashville. He then boarded Marine One and surveyed the devastation from the air. The visit comes a day after Trump approved a major disaster declaration for the state and ordered federal aid to supplement local recovery efforts in Davidson, Putnam and Wilson counties. ""You’re great people. It’s a great state,"" Trump said.       President Donald Trump speaks with Gov.

Many more people were injured, some critically. Trump was joined on the trip by Gov. Bill Lee, Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., and other top officials. Ricky Shelton, Cookeville's mayor, said the site was like a ""warzone"" when the tornado first hit. The officials emphasized the suddenness of the tornadoes and also praised the administration's response -- including both the declaration and the cooperation between federal and local officials. ""They just appeared,"" Trump said of the tornadoes. ""And we’re working very hard. FEMA's doing a great job,"" he said. 38 STILL UNACCOUNTED FOR AFTER TORNADOES RIP THROUGH CENTRAL TENNESSEE       Marine One, with President Donald Trump aboard, left, flies over damage after a recent tornado, Friday, March 6, 2020, taken on the plane in flight over Cookeville, Tenn.

,"                          President Trump signs an $8.3 billion spending bill aiming to fight the coronavirus outbreak at the White House, says his team may still visit the CDC. President Trump signed an $8.3 billion spending bill Friday aimed at fighting the coronavirus outbreak, the culmination of a bipartisan effort by Congress and the White House to provide funds to federal agencies, as well as state and local governments, to battle the disease. “We’re doing well, but it’s an unforeseen problem,” the president said as he signed the legislation in the White House's Diplomatic Reception Room. He made the comments before departing for Tennessee to tour damage from tornadoes that struck the state earlier this week. Trump also said he did not think Americans were too worried about the potential effects of the coronavirus. ""I don't think they're panicking,"" Trump said at the bill signing. ""It'll go away."" Earlier, the White House said the president had canceled a planned trip Friday to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, with the White House saying that the president does not want to interfere with the agency's work to fight the novel coronavirus. But speaking to reporters, Trump said he still may go the CDC, saying the visit was canceled because of concerns someone at CDC may have been infected. Tests, though, have since come back negative, he said. By Friday morning, the trip to Atlanta had been added back to the president's schedule. ""They had one person who was potentially infected ... Because of the one person, at a high level,"" Trump said. TRUMP TO SIGN $8.3B CORONAVIRUS FUNDING BILL FRIDAY, PENCE SAYS Vice President Mike Pence announced Thursday that Trump would sign the $8.3 billion spending bill to fund the fight against the coronavirus on Friday. The legislation passed overwhelmingly in both the House of Representatives and the Senate in a rare show of bipartisanship in a very polarized Congress. The vice president said the efforts by health officials and lawmakers represented the “very best of D.C. coming together, putting the health and wellbeing of the American people first and making nearly $8 billion available not only to federal agencies but to state and local efforts as we confront coronavirus.” The bill will fund the development of vaccines, medications to treat the disease and diagnostic tests all while helping state and local governments -- and foreign governments -- fight the coronavirus, which causes a disease officially known as COVID-19. Also at the bill signing, Trump addressed a variety of other topics as he spoke with reporters, including stock market fluctuations, the Federal Reserve and Thursday's exit from the presidential race by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. ""I think financial markets will bounce back,"" Trump said as markets were down over 700 points already Friday morning. ""They were up 70 percent so it's a relatively small piece. I don't like to see it happen because I was looking for 30,000 relatively soon."" On Warren, Trump said, ""I think lack of talent was her problem,"" after a reporter asked him if he thought sexism played a role in the failure of Warren's presidential campaign. ""She was a good debater, she destroyed Mike Bloomberg very quickly, like it was nothing... But people don't like her. She's a very mean person... People don't want that. They like a person like me, that's not mean."" Trump also slammed the Federal Reserve for not taking actions similar to what other central banks around the world have done. ""We're going to see whether or not the Fed wants to stimulate. In my opinion they should,"" Trump said. ""Everybody is but us ... I have a Fed that is not exactly proactive, I'm being very nice when I say that."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China, before spreading worldwide.

,"                          Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders battle for the Democratic presidential nomination ahead of the Michigan primary; Fox News senior political correspondent Mike Emanuel reports. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on Saturday expressed doubt that Democratic presidential primary rival Joe Biden can “generate enthusiasm” due to the support he is getting from dozens of billionaires -- while promising to back the former vice president if he is the nominee. “The American people are disgusted with billionaires buying elections. We believe in democracy, one person one vote, not billionaires spending hundreds of millions of dollars ” Sanders told supporters in Dearborn, Mich. “I just don't think that Joe Biden can generate enthusiasm when you got 60 billionaires contributing to his campaign,” he said to boos. DEMOCRACY 2020 DIGEST: BIDEN PRESS SECRETARY SAYS SANDERS IS 'LYING' He went on to accuse Biden's backers of running “ugly” ads against him. The two men have trained their sights on each other after most other candidates have pulled out of the race -- with only Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, as the third remaining candidate. “When you've got, Joe Biden has a Super PAC with billionaires putting money into that Super PAC and right now our campaign has taken on a Super PAC running ugly negative ads against us all over the country,” Sanders said. After Biden scored major wins on Super Tuesday, restoring his status as frontrunner, Sanders has sought to draw a bigger distinction between them -- casting doubt on Biden’s ability to fight for the American people. “At the end of the day, people understand that if you're taking lots of money from billionaires, you’re not going to be there standing up for the working class and the middle class of this country,” he said. MODERATE DEMS BREATHE SIGH OF RELIEF AFTER SUPER TUESDAY BLUNTS SANDERS However, he also said he would support Biden if he got the nod from the Democratic Party, something that Biden has also said about Sanders. ""Because we know how important it is to beat President Trump,"" Sanders said. The remarks indicate the race for the nomination is intensifying. The self-described democratic socialist has targeted Biden since before Super Tuesday, but that has increased since Biden swept 10 of the 14 Super Tuesday states. This week, Sanders accused Biden of supporting banning openly gay Americans from serving in the military when he was in the Senate. Biden campaign national press secretary Jamal Brown responded by saying Sanders was “lying.” “[Biden] is on record saying he didn't have an issue with gays & lesbians in the military,” he said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP With 125 pledged delegates at stake, Michigan is the biggest prize among the six states holding primaries on Tuesday, March 10. Missouri, Mississippi, Washington State, Idaho and North Dakota also hold contests. Sanders told reporters on Thursday: ""Michigan is where we'll spend a bit of our time."" Fox News' Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.

,"                          Former Vice President Joe Biden rallies supporters at a Super Tuesday event in Los Angeles, California. The Democratic primary took a dramatic turn on Super Tuesday, with Joe Biden winning at least eight states to continue his comeback story. At the same time, Bernie Sanders took home at least four states, including a win in delegate-rich California, to set up a showdown between the two in the primaries ahead. Maine and the key state of Texas remained extraordinarily close. Preliminary data from surveys in eight states conducted as part of the Fox News Voter Analysis sheds light on why the Super Tuesday results shook out the way they did – though these numbers may change slightly as more results come in.  Biden’s resounding win on Saturday in South Carolina gave him a much-needed boost and pushed fellow moderates Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg out of the race. Klobuchar, Buttigieg, and former presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke all endorsed Biden at an event in Dallas on Monday night, bolstering the sense of a campaign gathering steam.  BIDEN SURGES TO VICTORY ACROSS SUPER TUESDAY MAP, AS SANDERS CLAIMS DELEGATE PRIZE IN CALIFORNIA Late-deciding voters clearly bought into the idea that Biden was still in the game. More than a quarter of voters in each state said they made up their minds in the last few days – including more than half of those in Minnesota. Biden won late deciders by at least 15 points in every state but California, and by roughly 30 points or more in Virginia, Alabama, Minnesota, and North Carolina.  Sanders’ main sources of strength continue to be young and very liberal voters. He won better than four-in-10 voters under age 30 in each Super Tuesday state, topping out at 60 percent in a trio of states. Similarly, Sanders won at least four-in-10 of those who called themselves “very liberal” in each state.  By contrast, Biden’s base was seniors and, to a lesser degree, political moderates. He won at least four-in-10 voters over age 65 in every state except California, Colorado, and Massachusetts.  Among both seniors and moderates, Mike Bloomberg’s presence in the race appears to have complicated Biden’s path to victory. Roughly two-in-10 seniors in each state (except Minnesota and Massachusetts) backed the former mayor, and he picked up roughly 15 percent of the moderate vote or more in each state.  The Sanders campaign invested heavily in outreach to the Latino community, and it paid off in the states with the largest Hispanic populations. Biden narrowly edged Bloomberg as Latinos’ second choice.  Sanders’ strength among Latinos was balanced by Biden’s success with black voters. Biden won roughly half of the black vote (or better) in every state except for California (36 percent). Sanders’ best performance among black voters was 26 percent in North Carolina, followed by 24 percent in California.  Biden won white voters in Alabama, Virginia, and Minnesota; Sanders won whites in Colorado, and the two were deadlocked (or nearly so) in the remaining states.  Whites without a college degree went for Sanders by double-digit margins in Colorado and backed Biden by 11 percentage points in Alabama and 15 points in Virginia. The margins among this group in the other states were razor-thin.  The best groups for Bloomberg tended to overlap directly with sources of Biden’s strength: seniors, blacks, and political moderates. Biden’s late surge, however, effectively pushed Bloomberg off the map – the billionaire got less than two-in-10 late-deciding voters in each state.  Adding to Bloomberg’s difficult night was a failure to connect on his signature issues. Despite committing a considerable amount of his personal fortune to gun control and combating climate change, he won no more than two-in-10 voters who prioritized those issues in each state. Similarly, Bloomberg’s attempt to position himself as the candidate most likely to beat President Trump fell short – in each state, he got 20 percent or less among those who said beating President Trump was a very important quality for their nominee.  Most Super Tuesday voters – six-in-10 in most states, with a high of 73 percent in Minnesota – said it was important to them that a woman be elected president in their lifetime. Elizabeth Warren won 29 percent of these voters in Massachusetts, but still lost her adopted home state. In each other state, she won less than a quarter of those who wanted to see a female president in their lifetime.   Issues and policies As in the early primary states, more Super Tuesday voters wanted a candidate who would bring fundamental change to the political system than one who would restore it to the way it was before the Trump administration. That was particularly true in California and Colorado, two of the best states for Sanders.  At the same time, about six-in-10 voters wanted a candidate offering practical, centrist policies over one promising bold liberal ideas – even in more liberal states like California.   Biden won “restore” voters in each state, while Sanders won “change” voters everywhere except for Alabama (where they went for Biden). Similarly, voters wanting centrist policies opted for Biden in each state, and those seeking bold liberal ideas went for Sanders everywhere save Alabama (where, again, Biden won).  Despite divisions about the tone and tenor of their candidates’ approaches, Democrats were largely united in their opinions on key issues and policies. Health care topped voters’ issue list, with at least one-third in each state citing it as the most important issue facing the country. The economy and jobs was second in most of the Southern states (cited by roughly two-in-10 voters). Outside of the South, voters were more likely to mention climate change as their second-place concern (between 26 percent in California and 32 percent in Colorado).  On health care, more than eight-in-10 voters in each state favored a public option approach, while roughly two-thirds in each state backed a Sanders-style single payer plan.  Primary voters also broadly agreed on taxing the use of carbon-based fuels (support ranged between 62 percent in Alabama and 87 percent in Minnesota), marijuana legalization (72 percent in Virginia and Texas to 84 percent in Colorado), and reducing the criminal justice system’s focus on low-level offenses (78 percent in Alabama to 85 percent in Colorado). Fully nine-in-10 primary voters in Colorado and California favored limiting the amount of money presidential candidates and campaigns could spend, while support for the idea was slightly lower in Texas (85 percent) and Alabama (78 percent).  Democrats divided? Majorities of voters in each state would be satisfied if Biden, Sanders, or Warren were the eventual nominee. Overall satisfaction was slightly higher for Biden (ranging between 58 percent in Colorado and 81 percent in Alabama) than for Sanders (a low of 55 in Virginia and a high of 67 in California) or Warren (60 in Virginia to 71 in Colorado).  It was a different story for Bloomberg, as satisfaction ranged from a low of 39 (Colorado and Minnesota) to a high of 61 (Alabama). In five states, majorities would be dissatisfied if he captured the nomination. Across all states, nearly half of Biden and Bloomberg voters would be dissatisfied with Sanders as the nominee, while roughly six-in-ten Sanders supporters would be dissatisfied with Biden. Majorities of Warren voters would be satisfied with either Biden or Sanders as the nominee.  Sanders’ voters’ dissatisfaction could be amplified by concerns about the fairness of the nomination process. While roughly two-thirds of Super Tuesday voters overall had confidence in the process, a majority of Sanders voters felt the process was unfair.  Roughly three-quarters of voters (or more) in each state said they would definitely support the Democratic candidate in November against Trump, with Minnesota voters showing the most party solidarity (84 percent).  In several key swing states, however, two-in-ten voters said their decision in November would depend on who won the Democratic nomination. Warren voters were the most likely to say they would support the Democrat regardless of who won; Sanders and Bloomberg supporters were the least likely. Still, at least three-quarters of each candidate’s supporters said they would back the eventual nominee no matter what.  Texas and California The two largest prizes of the night – Texas and California – were a study in contrasts. Sanders was dominant throughout California, with Biden a distant second and both Bloomberg and Warren hovering around the 15 percent viability threshold for delegates. In Texas, on the other hand, Sanders and Biden were neck-and-neck, with Bloomberg lurking in third and Warren a distant fourth.  In California, Sanders led among most demographic groups, with the exception of moderates (with whom Biden led by 6 points), voters ages 45 and over (Biden +7 points) and black voters (Biden +12 points).  Sanders’ strongest groups in California – as they were across the country – were young voters, very liberal voters, and Latinos. He also won nearly four-in-ten voters without a college degree.  Biden’s strength with late-deciding voters helped him hold down Sanders’ delegate gains out of the Golden State.  Perhaps the most competitive – and consequential – battleground of the night was Texas, where Bloomberg played a major role. White voters split between the two leaders (27 percent for Biden and 25 for Sanders), while Bloomberg picked up 17 percent and Warren 13 percent. Sanders nearly doubled Biden’s support among Latinos, and Biden returned the favor by dominating among black Texans. Warren was unable to attract significant nonwhite support in the state.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Texans were much more likely to favor a public option approach to health care (87 percent) than single payer (63 percent) – and yet more felt Sanders would be best able to handle health care than Biden.  Methodology The Fox News Voter Analysis, conducted in partnership with The Associated Press, provides a comprehensive look at voting behavior, opinions and preferences as America votes. On Super Tuesday, surveys were conducted in Alabama, California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. The surveys were conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago the week before the primaries, concluding as polls closed. Interviews were conducted in English or Spanish. The survey is based on interviews with a random sample of registered voters drawn from the state voter file. In California, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Texas, and Virginia, these probability sample results were supplemented by interviews with self-identified registered voters recruited from nonprobability online panels. The sample sizes for the surveys ranged from 1,168 (Alabama) to 3,976 (California), with margins of sampling error ranging between plus or minus 4.9 and 3.0 percentage points.

,"                          Some Republicans are reportedly growing concerned about the virus' impact on the stock market and Americans' sense of security heading into the election; reaction and analysis on 'Outnumbered.' By a 20-point margin, voters say the Trump administration has mostly succeeded at stimulating the economy: 51 percent think that and 31 percent believe he has mostly failed. In addition, by a 19-point margin, more think the administration has mostly succeeded at creating jobs (50 percent succeeded, 31 percent failed). These are two of nine national priorities the latest Fox News Poll asks voters about.  The findings indicate success in some areas, while others need improvement -- including security. CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS The poll, released Friday, also finds more voters say they are better off than they were four years ago (35 percent) than worse off (24 percent).  The largest number, however, feels their situation is about the same (40 percent).  Nearly three times as many Republicans (58 percent) as Democrats (19 percent) say they are better off today. The president’s worst rating is on unifying the country: 59 percent say Trump has mostly failed (19 percent mostly succeeded).  Almost as many think he has mostly failed at improving race relations (55 percent), and many say the same about improving health care (50 percent failed). Voters are less than wowed with the job Trump has done on his “drain the swamp in Washington” promise -- 48 percent call that a failure (21 percent succeeded). Views are more mixed on security issues.  On making the country safer, voters say the administration has mostly failed by 7 points (38 succeeded, 45 failed). And despite the expansion of the U.S.-Mexico border wall, voters divide over whether Trump has been effective on his signature issue of border security (40 succeeded, 42 failed). On handling the Islamic extremist group ISIS, voters split:  39 percent mostly succeeded vs. 38 percent mostly failed. For comparison, voters believed the Obama administration had mostly failed on many of these same priorities as his term started to wind down. In January 2016, majorities gave failing grades for stimulating the economy (51 percent mostly failed), improving health care (53 percent), making the country safer (58 percent), improving race relations (59 percent), and handling ISIS (65 percent). In general, 47 percent of voters approve of Trump’s job performance and 52 percent disapprove.  That is a tad better than last month when it was 45-54 percent (January 2020).  The president’s best rating continues to be 48 percent approve vs. 47 percent disapprove in February 2017, soon after his inauguration.  His record low was 38 percent approval in October 2017. Fully 89 percent of Republicans are happy with Trump’s performance. And, his job approval stands at a record high of 14 percent among Democrats. Overall, a majority of voters approve of how Trump’s handling the economy (54 approve, 42 disapprove) -- yet a majority disapproves on health care (38 approve, 53 disapprove). Poll Pourri -- Most voters are at least somewhat confident the federal government is prepared to deal with the coronavirus (74 percent).  A smaller majority feels confident U.S. intelligence agencies are prepared to deal with the Russian government trying to interfere in the next presidential election (68 percent). -- On the Senate impeachment trial, voters approve of Trump’s acquittal (50-44 percent). -- Views split on Trump’s recent presidential pardons.  Forty-nine percent think they were an abuse of pardon power, while 43 percent call them “fairly typical.”  In February 2001, 55 percent said pardons by former President Clinton were an abuse of power and 32 percent said typical. -- Voters remain unhappy with lawmakers in Washington:  26 percent approve of the job Congress is doing and 65 percent disapprove. -- Nearly half of voters, 49 percent, disapprove of Trump’s tweeting.  That’s more than double the 19 percent who approve.  Another 28 percent “wish he’d be more cautious.” Conducted February 23-26, 2020 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,000 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones.  The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points for all registered voters.

,"                          Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Capitalism beats socialism by a two-to-one margin in the latest Fox News Poll. By a 26-point spread, voters have a more positive than negative view of capitalism (56 favorable - 30 unfavorable). The opposite holds true for socialism, where sentiment is net negative by 30 points (28 favorable - 58 unfavorable). CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS That’s almost exactly where things stood a year ago, despite the popularity of Sen. Bernie Sanders', I-Vt., presidential campaign. The Democratic presidential frontrunner says “billionaires should not exist,” yet 76 percent of voters overall and 67 percent of Democrats think it’s a good thing people can become billionaires in the United States. For many though, there are limits.  Voters agree by a 56-35 percent margin the government “should increase taxes on the wealthiest individuals so that nobody gets to be too rich.”  A decade ago, it was the reverse: 40 percent favored increased taxes and 55 percent disagreed. Billionaires, generically, garner somewhat negative ratings in the poll (35 favorable - 44 unfavorable).  Mere millionaires are a bit more popular (41 favorable - 39 unfavorable).  One in five voters is unable to give an opinion of either millionaires or billionaires. Views among groups Twice as many Democrats (40 percent) as Republicans (15 percent) feel positively about socialism. Republicans (67 percent) are more likely than Democrats (50 percent) to have a favorable view of capitalism. Men are 26 points more likely than women to have a favorable view of capitalism (70 vs. 44 percent).  That gender gap disappears on socialism, as roughly equal numbers of men (29 percent) and women (27 percent) feel positively.

,"                          As young voters embrace Sen. Bernie Sanders' promises of 'free' college and health care, a new study shows only 16 percent of millennials are 'financially literate.' Bernie Sanders pushes Joe Biden out of the frontrunner spot for the Democratic nomination, capturing a record 31 percent support among primary voters in a new Fox News Poll. This is the first 2020 Fox national poll that finds Biden not leading the Democratic race. The survey also finds a marked increase in the number of voters who think President Trump will win the election. Sanders has gained 8 percentage points since January in the nomination race, while Biden drops into second with 18 percent, down 8 points. Close behind is Mike Bloomberg at 16 percent, up 6 points since last month and triple his 5 percent in December. Pete Buttigieg comes in at 12 percent (up 5), Elizabeth Warren at 10 percent (down 4), and Amy Klobuchar at 5 percent (up 2). This is the first Fox News poll with five candidates in double digits. It was conducted Sunday through Wednesday. Sanders, notably, was the most attacked candidate during Tuesday’s contentious presidential debate in South Carolina. Sanders performs well with groups across the board, with an extra boost from young voters, self-described liberals, whites without a college degree, and those looking for change. Biden is strongest among women over age 45, voters who regularly attend religious services, and those who long for a return to the pre-Trump era. CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS The nomination race looks almost the same when narrowed to Democratic primary voters in the 14 Super Tuesday states: Sanders remains on top with 30 percent, followed by Bloomberg at 18 percent, Biden 17 percent, Warren 11 percent, and Buttigieg and Klobuchar each get 8 percent. Overall, majorities of primary voters think Sanders (65 percent), Bloomberg (57 percent) and Biden (56 percent) can beat Donald Trump. Since December, the number believing Sanders can win is up 5 points (was 60 percent). But Democratic voters’ faith in most of the other candidates is shaken since December. The portion saying Biden can win is down 21 points (from 77 percent), while Warren (-22 points) and Buttigieg (-12) also saw declines. Democrats remain divided on central questions facing their party. By a 10-point margin, more want a nominee who will fundamentally change how the political system works (52 percent) than want someone who will restore the system to pre-Trump administration (42 percent). There is a similar divide over whether they prefer a nominee who is a pragmatist or a visionary: by a 9-point margin, more are looking for a candidate who will pursue “practical centrist” policies (49 percent) than want someone who will pursue “bold liberal” plans (40 percent). Sanders leads by more than 30 points among “bold liberal” voters, while support among “practical centrist” voters splinters: Biden (21 percent), Bloomberg (20 percent), Sanders (19 percent) and Buttigieg (15 percent). Those wanting change prefer Sanders by more than 20 percentage points. Biden is the favorite for those wanting to hit reset, although he leads by a narrower 9-point margin. It’s important not to overstate these differences, as Sanders is the second choice among restore voters and Bloomberg comes in second among change voters. More primary voters think Biden’s policies are realistic (67 percent), than say the same about Bloomberg (57 percent realistic), Buttigieg (55 percent), Sanders (53 percent), Warren (49 percent), and Klobuchar (44 percent). When asked if there is a candidate primary voters could not support, Bloomberg and Sanders (18 percent each) have the largest number saying they would refuse to vote for them in November, followed by Biden and Warren (13 percent apiece) and Tulsi Gabbard (10 percent). Forty-five percent of Democratic primary voters say they would vote for any one of the current candidates over Trump. There is no hurry to narrow the field. Fifty-four percent of primary voters want candidates to stay in the race even if they failed to finish in the top three in any of the early contests. What’s more, by a 50-38 percent margin, they say the Democratic Party should have the flexibility to nominate someone else if no candidate has a majority of delegates at the convention. Sanders, as the candidate currently best positioned to win the most delegates, thinks the candidate with the delegate lead should win the nomination, even if it isn’t a majority. The other top candidates support flexibility if no candidate has a majority. In general, 75 percent of all Democratic primary voters and 67 percent of Sanders supporters feel confident the Democratic Party’s process of picking a nominee is fair. 2020 general election Among all voters, all six Democratic candidates tested top the president in trial ballots. Trump trails Biden and Bloomberg by 8 points and Sanders by 7. Those are the only leads outside the poll’s margin of error.  Warren (+3 points), Buttigieg (+3) and Klobuchar (+1) are barely ahead. And in each instance, there are enough undecided/third-party voters to move the race either way. Forty-two percent would vote to re-elect Trump if the election were today. That’s up from 38 percent in May 2019 and the largest share he’s received to-date. On the other side, a majority of 52 percent would vote for someone else. That puts the president underwater by 10 points, an improvement from a net negative of 16 points in May 2019. At the extremes: 32 percent would definitely vote for Trump vs. 45 would definitely back someone else. Despite those findings, 56 percent think Trump will be re-elected. That’s up from 44 percent in October.  Expectations increased among Republicans (+9 points) and Democrats (+16). Eight years ago, 52 percent thought former President Obama would be re-elected. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Poll Pourri Biden (50 percent) and Sanders (49 percent) have the highest favorable ratings -- and have more who view them positively than negatively. Biden’s net favorability rating is best (+4 points), followed by Sanders (+2), and Buttigieg (+1). Klobuchar is net neutral, and the ratings for Warren (-4), Steyer (-7), Bloomberg (-8), and Trump (-11) are underwater. Voters favor giving everyone the option to buy into Medicare by a 67-23 percent margin and making minor changes to Obamacare by 58-32 percent. A 49-percent plurality opposes getting rid of private insurance and moving to a government-run health care system (42 percent favor). Among Democratic primary voters, 76 percent favor the public option (Buttigieg’s position), 74 percent favor mostly keeping Obamacare (Biden), and 56 percent favor a government-run plan (Sanders and Warren). The poll, released Thursday, asks Democratic primary voters if any candidates may not be physically healthy enough to carry out the job of president. Sanders is the most frequently mentioned at 30 percent, followed by Biden at 16 percent. Nearly one in five Sanders supporters thinks he may lack what it takes to do the job physically. Among all voters, 63 percent think presidential candidates should be required to release their full medical records, and 70 percent say the same about tax returns. When it comes to Democratic primary voters, there is an even larger desire for full disclosure: 72 percent want to see full medical records and 90 percent want to see tax returns.

,"                          Fox News has confirmed the departure of Corbin Trent from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's re-election campaign. He was the campaign’s spokesman and former leader at Justice Democrats. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is coming under fire after urging illegal immigrants to participate in the upcoming census -- with opponents saying her language was “anti-American,” ""We're all going to get mailed a prompt to fill out the census in the next two weeks or so,"" she said Thursday on “Late Night with Seth Meyers.” ""And so I think what’s really important is that we all fill this out. It happens once every 10 years.” FACEBOOK DROPS TRUMP ADS AFTER PELOSI CITES CENSUS CONFUSION “Every single person, no matter your documentation status, no matter your housing status, income, etc., is to be counted,” she said, before assuring viewers that the data included is “completely confidential” and not shared with other agencies. “So don’t worry if you’re having a creative living situation, it’s not going to be told to your landlord or anything crazy like that,” she added. The census is a once-a-decade population count that determines how $1.5 trillion in federal spending is allocated, and also how many congressional seats each state gets. The Census Bureau notes that it counts “our population and households” in the U.S. The remarks come after she shared a video, distributed by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's office, and emphasized that ""you will NOT be asked about immigration status."" Ocasio-Cortez’s remarks angered at least one New York lawmaker -- who said her rhetoric was “anti-American.” “Illegal aliens should not be counted equally to law-abiding Americans and legal immigrants – plain and simple,” Assemblyman Mike LiPetri said in a statement.  “When radical left-wing politicians like AOC make such statements, she sends a message to all Americans and legal immigrants that it doesn’t matter if you work hard and play by the rules, we’re going to prioritize criminals and those here illegally over you.” AOC CLAIMS BIDEN 'OVERPERFORMED' SUPER TUESDAY BECAUSE HIS CAMPAIGN FACED 'LOW EXPECTATIONS'  Ocasio-Cortez’s push for those in the country illegally to fill out the census is part of a broader fight over the census, which saw the Trump administration try to include a question on citizenship in the census. That move was scrapped after the Supreme Court ruled against the administration, with Democrats claiming that even asking the question could spook illegal immigrants from filling out the entire census. The question however, did not ask whether a non-citizen was here illegally or not, just whether they were a citizen. A number of Democratic states and localities, including New York and California, are estimated to have large numbers of illegal immigrants and the amount of funding they receive -- something determined by the census -- rests in part of how many of them they can get to fill out the form. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump in July last year accused Democrats of trying to “conceal the number of illegal aliens in our midst.” This is part of a broader left-wing effort to erode the rights of the American citizen,” he said. “And it’s very unfair to our country.”    ",         Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calls on illegal immigrants to fill out 2020 census,,         2020-03-07T091229-0500,,,https://foxnews.com/politics/ocasio-cortez-illegal-immigrants-2020-census,Fox

,"                          Democratic presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard addresses preparations that need to be made to protect the U.S. from a coronavirus outbreak. The only woman remaining in the 2020 race for the White House is calling on her party's top two competitors to help pressure the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to allow her to participate in an upcoming presidential debate in Phoenix. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, is now one of only three Democratic candidates still running for president. On Super Tuesday, March 3, she walked away with two delegates from American Samoa, which would have helped her qualify in the previous debate, held Feb. 25 in Charleston, S.C. However, the DNC released a new requirement for the March 15 Phoenix debate. Participants for that contest must have at least 20 percent of the pledged delegates, which means only the two leaders -- former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. -- qualify. 'THE VIEW' LAUGHS OFF TULSI GABBARD AFTER SHE WON DELEGATE ON SUPER TUESDAY: 'PUT A FORK IN IT!' On Friday night, Gabbard took to social media and appealed to Biden and Sanders to let her join them on the debate stage once again. ""@JoeBiden @Bernie Sanders I’m sure you would agree that our Democratic nominee should be a person who will stand up for what is right. So I ask that you have the courage to do that now in the face of the DNC's effort to keep me from participating in the debates,"" Gabbard tweeted. She then called out the DNC for changing the debate requirements to allow Mike Bloomberg onto the debate stage. ""To keep me off the stage, the DNC again arbitrarily changed the debate qualifications. Previously they changed the qualifications in the OPPOSITE direction so Bloomberg could debate.

,"                          Sen. Elizabeth Warren expresses disappointment that little girls will have to wait four more years for the chance of a female president; reaction and analysis on 'Outnumbered.' Now that Elizabeth Warren has bowed to the inevitable, the Biden-Bernie matchup is either a battle for the soul of the Democratic Party…or the typical dust-settling of a conventional race. That is, one establishment candidate, a veteran, battle-scarred establishment type who is not terribly exciting, and an insurgent candidate, a colorful, more ideological provocateur who makes followers swoon. In this view, the voters who gave Joe Biden 10 Super Tuesday victories were simply coming home after flirting with two dozen potential dates. Biden was the safe, dependable choice for those whose main goal is beating President Trump—and that includes some who feel more affinity with Bernie Sanders. Usually, this plays out over a couple of months, and the race is hardly over. But in the space of four days, Biden transformed his fortunes and, in what had seemed unthinkable, passed Sanders in the delegate count. It didn’t hurt that Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg closed ranks behind him, followed by Mike Bloomberg, or that he was lifted aloft by his first sustained burst of positive press. But the breadth of his coalition—African-Americans, working classes, suburban dwellers and older voters—suggests he was always a likely front-runner once folks were convinced he could win. BLOOMBERG INVESTMENT BOMBS AS PRESS BELATEDLY BOOSTS BIDEN It was, as John Harris puts it in Politico, “a signal that not all the old ways of thinking about national politics are defunct in an age of disruption.” The 2008 contest was the exception, with newcomer Obama toppling semi-incumbent Hillary. But Harris recites the history: “Jimmy Carter in 1980, Walter Mondale in 1984, Bill Clinton in 1992, John Kerry in 2004, Hillary Clinton in 2016—the party has ultimately coalesced over the more consensus-oriented politician in the spring after a flirtation with more flamboyant or purely ideological insurgents.” And that means Gary Hart, Paul Tsongas, Howard Dean, Bill Bradley—and Bernie last time—didn’t win. The very factors that made Biden seem like a plodding war horse—nearly four decades in the Senate, eight as vice president, lots of political baggage—were why a majority of Democrats have so far decided that he’d be a reassuring choice as commander-in-chief. And that brings us to why the race is now down to a 77-year-old Democrat, a 78-year-old independent and a 73-year-old president. When Warren emerged from her Cambridge home and made some humble withdrawal comments, MSNBC reporter Ali Vitali asked: “I wonder what your message would be to the women and girls who feel like we’re left with two old white men to decide between?” (We’re left with.) SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES Warren replied that “one of the hardest parts of this is all those pinky promises and all those little girls who are going to have to wait four more years. That’s going to be hard.” The problem with this question is that Warren was riding a wave of favorable press and voter support when she was leading the polls last fall. Then she started making mistakes, from embracing and then fudging on Medicare for All to migrating from an unabashed progressive to a “unity” candidate. Of course there is sexism in the press and in society. But that didn’t stop Hillary from winning the nomination and the popular vote. Warren, Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand didn’t drop out because America is wedded to male septuagenarians; they just failed to get sufficient traction. Here’s a different view of the former Harvard law professor from Megan Garber in the Atlantic: “Warren had something about her, apparently: something that galled the pundits and the public in a way that led to assessments of her not just as ‘strident’ and ‘shrill,’ but also as ‘condescending.’ The matter is not merely that the candidate is unlikable, these deployments of condescending imply. The matter is instead that her unlikability has a specific source, beyond bias and internalized misogyny.  “Warren knows a lot, and has accomplished a lot, and is extremely competent, condescending acknowledges, before twisting the knife: It is precisely because of those achievements that she represents a threat. Condescending attempts to rationalize an irrational prejudice…When I hear her talk, I want to slap her, even when I agree with her.” Running for president is brutal; only one person prevails in each party. Everyone’s personality is mocked; Joe Biden is routinely portrayed as a rambling, forgetful geezer. In “SNL” terms, Kate McKinnon is Warren the know-it-all; Larry David is Bernie the ranting relative; Alec Baldwin is Trump the know-nothing. Maybe it comes down to the fact that this was the first presidential campaign for Warren, who got into politics less than a decade ago, but the second for Sanders and the third for Biden. The former veep will need that experience, if he’s the nominee, going up against another political newcomer who has come to dominate American politics.

,"                           Mike Bloomberg didn’t need one of his fancy Wall Street terminals to interpret the data that he got shellacked on Super Tuesday. And faster than anyone might have imagined, he got out of the race and backed Joe Biden. Bloomberg’s return on his $500-million investment: not much, though he’ll always have American Samoa. It was a stark reminder that money—even massive amounts of money on a scale never before seen in American politics—can’t buy a nomination. And an equally dramatic reminder that the press makes the same mistake every four years, conflating big bucks with political strength. Bloomberg, who never recovered from that Vegas debate debacle, was smart to call it quits, and his considerable fortune will certainly help Biden, especially if the former VP prevails against Bernie Sanders and has to battle the Trump machine. BIDEN SHOCKS THE PUNDITS, AGAIN, WITH SURPRISINGLY STRONG SUPER TUESDAY Politicians and the press always overstate the importance of money and organization. They matter, but not as much as the candidate and the message. That mistake has been made again and again, with candidates ranging from Phil Gramm to Jeb Bush to, well, Donald Trump, who was massively outspent in 2016. And how many pieces did I have to read about Elizabeth Warren’s awesome field operation? That didn’t stop her from being clobbered again and again, even finishing third in her home state of Massachusetts. When the press was portraying Biden as having one foot in the political grave, Bloomberg became the new savior—especially for many in the party who feared a Bernie nomination would be disastrous. And it’s true that as he blitzed the airwaves, he moved up in the polls. But Bloomberg was damaged by reports of things he’d done and said as a Republican, especially stop and frisk, and was less than impressive when he finally came out from behind the curtain to do a couple of interviews. In the end, the money didn’t matter. Voters deserted him en masse as soon as Biden seemed viable again. In a way, the former vice president ought to thank the press for performing last rites on his struggling campaign. It made his victories in Virginia, Massachusetts, Maine, North Carolina, Alabama, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Minnesota and Texas seem absolutely miraculous. The way in which so much of the press had declared Biden finished, kaput, washed up after Iowa and New Hampshire was nothing short of journalistic malpractice. “Drop out, Joe Biden. New Hampshire proves you are done,” said a Business Insider headline. SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES Everyone knew those two small, largely white states were rough terrain for Biden, and yet it didn’t matter. Even after his blowout win in South Carolina, many journalists said he couldn’t possibly be competitive in 14 states because he didn’t have the money and organization (there are those words again). It didn’t matter. A strong ground game is great when a candidate is connecting. But the dogs have to like the dog food. The two-day interval between South Carolina and Super Tuesday turned out to be perfect for Biden. Peaking at the right time is political gold. Another week would have given him more time to raise money, but also more time for Sanders to sharpen his attacks and for unexpected events to intervene. The candidate, of course, deserves substantial credit. Biden got better as he grew in confidence. He was often photographed, by design, interacting with average votes, not a Sanders or Bloomberg specialty. His two victory speeches were tightly scripted rather than an attempt to thank everyone in the room. But the press should be careful about this latest swing of the pendulum. Biden is the same guy who not long ago was being derided for stupid gaffes, shaky debate performances and meandering speeches. Sanders still has a passionate following and substantial number of delegates. The same journalists who said Biden couldn’t win shouldn’t fall into the trap of now saying he can’t lose.

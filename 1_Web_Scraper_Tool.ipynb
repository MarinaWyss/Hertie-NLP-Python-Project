On Capitol Hill, at least three lawmakers were in self-quarantine as discussions were underway on how to address the virus outbreak and economic volatility and keep the government functioning.\\u003c/p>\\u003cdiv class=\\\"ad-placeholder\\\">\\u003c/div>\\u003cp>Trump dove into shake hands with supporters Monday morning when arriving to headline a fundraiser in Longwood, Florida, that raised approximately $4 million for his reelection campaign and the Republican Party. He ignored shouted questions about the plunging stock market as he boarded Air Force One for the flight back to Washington.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>In Monday morning tweets, Trump lashed out at the steep market drop and news that large public gatherings were being called off because of the virus. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>\\\"At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths,\\\" Trump tweeted, comparing it to seasonal influenza and the thousands of deaths that causes. “Think about that!” \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Scientists at this stage don’t know what the death rate of the new coronavirus actually is and whether it will wind up being about the same as flu or worse.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>At the same time, administration officials were insistent that they weren't trying to dismiss public concerns. “This is a very serious health problem,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told Fox News. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>At the Pentagon, officials have begun “social distancing” measures. On Monday, Defense Secretary Mark Esper’s regular meeting with senior staff, which normally would be held face-to-face in a single room with 40 to 50 participants, was broken up into three rooms, with video-teleconferencing among the rooms, according to the Pentagon’s chief spokesman, Jonathan Hoffman. He said Esper and the 15 to 20 people in his room, including Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, sat at least six feet apart, in line with health guidance.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Trump was delegating much of the virus response to Vice President Mike Pence, who convened a video teleconference to give an update on the federal government's virus response Monday afternoon with the nation's governors. Pence was also scheduled to lead a meeting of the administration's task force on Monday before holding a press briefing.\\u003c/p>\\u003cdiv class=\\\"ad-placeholder\\\">\\u003c/div>\\u003cp>Meanwhile, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., and Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga. put themselves in voluntary quarantine after exposure to a person who tested positive for the virus at last month's Conservative Political Action Conference.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, said he had been notified by CPAC officials that they had discovered a photo of him with the infected person. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>In a statement, Collins said he did not have any symptoms but would wait out the remainder of the 14 days since the contact at home. He met Trump on Tuesday night at the White House and shook hands with Trump on Friday when the president visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Atlanta headquarters.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Trump was meeting Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Larry Kudlow and other aides when he returned to the White House about a range of economic actions he could take. He also invited Wall Street executives to the White House later in the week to discuss the economic fallout of the epidemic.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Kudlow, director of the president’s National Economic Council, told reporters Friday that the administration is not looking at a “massive” federal relief plan. Rather, any federal aid package would be “timely and targeted and micro.”\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Lawmakers on Capitol Hill had barely started to contemplate the economic implications of the spread of the virus and what might be needed to stimulate the economy as people cancel vacations and business trips and stay away from stores. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley is “exploring the possibility of targeted tax relief measures that could provide a timely and effective response to the coronavirus,\\\" spokesman Michael Zona said Monday.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“Everything’s on the table,” Grassley told reporters.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Democrats indicated they preferred other responses, like passing legislation requiring employers to give their workers paid sick leave — a longtime policy priority of Democrats — and additional help for those with lower incomes. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“The best way to ensure economic security for the American people right now is to deal with the coronavirus itself, competent and full on,” said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer. “Something we haven’t yet seen. Getting a handle on the crisis and containing the spread of the virus is by far the best way to address any effects on the economy.” \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>A day after saying it was “proceeding as normal,\\\" Trump's campaign canceled a three-day Women for Trump bus tour across Michigan that included Mercedes Schlapp, the former White House aide who is married to the American Conservative Union chairman, Matt Schlapp. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Schlapp is under self-quarantine after after he, too, was exposed to the infected person at CPAC. He introduced Trump and greeted him with a handshake on stage before the president's spoke on Feb. 29.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“The president of the United States, as we all know, is quite a hand washer,\\\" press secretary Stephanie Grisham told Fox News. \\\"He uses hand sanitizer all the time.

Four years later, the same state could either revive the Vermont senator's campaign or relegate him to the role of protest candidate.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Michigan and five other states hold presidential contests on Tuesday at a critical point in the Democratic race. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Former Vice President Joe Biden is looking to cement his front-runner status after winning the most delegates during Super Tuesday last week.

He countered the parade of Democratic firepower lining up behind Biden by securing the endorsement of the Rev. Jesse Jackson. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Tuesday marks the first time voters will weigh in on the Democratic contest since it effectively narrowed to a two-person race between Sanders and Biden. It will be another test of whether Sanders can broaden his appeal among African Americans. Biden, meanwhile, must show that he can keep momentum going after his surprise Super Tuesday turnaround. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“I like his chances,” Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who has endorsed Biden, said of the former vice president in a phone interview Monday.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“He knows Michigan,\\\" Whitmer said. “When our back was up against the wall during the auto struggles of the past, it was Barack Obama and Joe Biden who had our backs. Others were saying, ‘Let Detroit go bankrupt.'”\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>That's a reference to the Obama administration overseeing federal bailouts that helped the auto industry — the lifeblood of Michigan's economy — weather the 2009 financial crisis. Sanders counters that he, too, voted to save the auto industry. He also says that, unlike Biden, he opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he said prompted thousands of Michigan jobs to move to Mexico since taking effect in 1994.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Appearing Monday with Booker at a campaign stop in Flint, Michigan, a community that has seen auto industry jobs disappear, Biden ticked off the names of six former presidential rivals who have endorsed him just in the past week: “They’ve all come out and endorsed at one time ... the candidate that they think can win.\\\"\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“I want to say to all of them and their supporters, I know how hard this is, but the message is simple: We want you, we need you, there’s a place in our campaign for you,” Biden said.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>An outstanding question going into Tuesday is whether Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who dropped out of the race last week, will endorse Biden or Sanders. So far, she's declined to back either, an especially frustrating development for Sanders, who could use Warren's help in unifying progressives in much the same way Biden has been able to rally moderates.\\u003c/p>\\u003cdiv class=\\\"ad-placeholder\\\">\\u003c/div>\\u003cp>Sanders has scoffed at suggestions he could drop out if he doesn't win Michigan, but his travel schedule underscores its importance. He canceled a trip to Mississippi and instead made five campaign stops across Michigan since Friday. And he was holding a roundtable in Detroit on Monday with health experts to discuss the spread of the new coronavirus. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Sanders has accused Biden of relying on billionaires to finance his campaign but also says he's now running against “the Democratic establishment.” The senator told Fox on Sunday that he'd win Michigan and repeated that at a rally in Grand Rapids, but added the major caveat for supporters that he'd only pull it off “if we stick together, we bring our friends out to vote.”\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Sanders won't say if he's personally lobbying Warren for her endorsement. He did manage to secure the backing of Jackson, who said it was no time for centrist compromise. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“With the exception of Native Americans, African Americans are the people who are most behind socially and economically in the United States and our needs are not moderate,\\\" Jackson said at Sanders' Grand Rapids rally. “A people far behind cannot catch up choosing the most moderate path.”\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Still, one of Sanders' highest-profile supporters, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, struck a far more conciliatory tone addressing 10,000-plus on the campus of the University of Michigan on Sunday night, saying, “In order for us to win, we have to grow.” \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“We must be inclusive. We must bring more people into this movement,\\\" she said, urging Sanders supporters to shed “cynicism and exclusion” and “turn with an embracing posture, where all people are welcome in a people's movement.” \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Sanders is hoping to do well in Washington state on Tuesday, but could face hurdles in Mississippi and Missouri. Sanders' team acknowledges he will also struggle in next week's Florida primary, where the senator's past defense of Fidel Castro looms large. He also could face long odds in Ohio and Illinois — especially if he underperforms in Michigan. Both of those states also vote March 17.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The wild card next week could be Arizona, where Sanders will be counting on strong Latino support, which lifted him to victory in California. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The intricate arithmetic of how delegates are won makes it possible Tuesday for a winning candidate to reap a bigger haul of delegates with a smaller margin of victory than any other night. This gives Biden an opportunity to greatly increase his lead over Sanders or for Sanders to close the gap.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Delegates are awarded proportionally mostly in congressional districts. And nearly two-thirds of Tuesday districts have odd amounts of delegates up for grabs. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>When there are an odd number of delegates available, that means one of the two candidates will get more delegates. In districts with an even number of delegates, proportional distribution means that in close races, both candidates get the same number of delegates and that makes it more difficult for Sanders to catch Biden. After March 17, most delegates are in districts with an even number of delegates.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Still, Sanders advisers are aware that trading a few big wins for Biden's running up the score elsewhere eventually gives the former vice president an insurmountable delegate lead as the race rolls on. They are hoping to continue to do well in the West and then pick up momentum of their own in places like New York, which holds its primary next month. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>There's no guarantee Sanders could last that long this time, however, given the higher expectations he now faces. Even some of those attending Sanders rallies are beginning to feel it. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“I think last time in 2016, it felt more spontaneous.

Last weekend there were five major candidates still in the primary fight, and Sanders was threatening to build an insurmountable delegate lead. But in the span of 72 hours, \\u003ca href=\\\"https://apnews.com/be14026452cb8d39de828ac25ff041cf\\\">two leading moderates dropped out\\u003c/a> and the party’s establishment wing sprinted into Biden’s camp. The former vice president used the extraordinary rush of momentum to seize a delegate advantage on \\u003ca href=\\\"https://apnews.com/3e98f0c7954b4fb031c78884d05c1878\\\">Super Tuesday\\u003c/a>. And with Sanders struggling to unify the progressive wing behind him ( \\u003ca href=\\\"https://apnews.com/7b475643fb3faf2ab543b68da8743308\\\">Elizabeth Warren is out\\u003c/a> but has refused to endorse), he enters another multistate primary test on Tuesday facing the prospect that Biden could soon build an insurmountable delegate lead.\\u003c/p>\\u003cdiv id='52b4f0b8ae934b519b041cea18a81a8e' class='media-placeholder'>\\u003c/div>\\u003cdiv class=\\\"ad-placeholder\\\">\\u003c/div>\\u003cp>___\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>THE BIG QUESTIONS\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Can Bernie get back on track in Michigan?\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>As we learned last week, it’s a mistake to focus too much on one state. After all, Sanders won Super Tuesday’s biggest delegate prize, California, and still finished the day with fewer delegates than Biden. With that warning, Michigan deserves your attention this week. The Midwestern state offers the largest trove of delegates on Tuesday and, almost as importantly, serves as a huge symbolic test of Sanders’ remaining political strength. Michigan helped rescue his candidacy four years ago, and it sits as one of three key battlegrounds Democrats desperately need to win in November. Going in this time, Sanders’ team had been supremely confident about his standing with the state and its large working-class population — at least until last week’s shakeup. Sanders knows he will not win them all, but he can’t afford to lose this one.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>How does Biden handle front-runner status this time?\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Biden has plenty of experience as a front-runner. And he hasn't always fared so well under the bright lights that go with it. After nearly being forced from the race last month following a dreadful start, the 77-year-old gaffe-prone Democrat gets another chance to prove he belongs on top. He will benefit from a lack of establishment alternatives should he stumble. He'll also benefit from the new phase of the race, which has essentially become a series of national contests where voters won't get to see the candidates as closely as they did in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. Still, make no mistake: Biden will face a new wave of fire from the right and the left this week as he seeks to tighten his grip on the Democrats' presidential nomination. \\u003c/p>\\u003cdiv class=\\\"ad-placeholder\\\">\\u003c/div>\\u003cp>Will Warren help unite progressives?\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Warren's silence has been notable. As a crush of establishment Democrats raced to line up behind Biden, the fiery progressive senator has refused to endorse her closest ideological ally, Sanders. There was obvious tension between Warren and Sanders during the primary, yet the same could be said of the many moderate candidates who are now standing behind Biden. Every day Warren sits on the sidelines hurts Sanders. He desperately needs a united progressive wing to defeat Biden, yet key pieces of Warren's coalition are holding back until she makes her move. This is the kind of decision that could have dramatic short- and long-term consequences for the progressive movement.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>How will a two-man debate change things?\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>There have never been fewer than six Democrats on the debate stage at one time in the 2020 primary season. Next Sunday in Arizona, there will be just two. And in case you missed it, neither is a woman or a person of color or under the age of 77. There are clear ideological differences, of course. Despite Biden and Sanders' superficial similarities, the silver-haired septuagenarians will face off representing starkly different views of the future of the Democratic Party and the nation. Sanders thinks he'll benefit from having more time to delve into issues of substance. And with more than four decades in Washington, Biden has a long record to answer for. There will be an unmistakably new dynamic on stage that may give voters their best glimpse so far of how each candidate would perform in a one-on-one debate with President Donald Trump this fall.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Can Trump handle the coronavirus outbreak?\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The Republican president is facing the greatest leadership test of his first term. And, so far, Trump is struggling to grasp basic facts about the rapidly escalating coronavirus threat, which has infected hundreds of Americans across 34 states and counting. That's even as he and his administration publicly declared last week that the virus was contained. And beyond public health, the economic fallout could be disastrous. Wall Street just suffered its worst week in more than a decade, and travel companies are bracing for massive losses. The general election is just eight months away. Trump needs to show he can lead the country through this growing crisis or face the consequences in November.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>___\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>THE FINAL THOUGHT\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>There's no need to panic, but the coronavirus threatens to shape American life in 2020 far more than some expected. Public officials are planning for the likelihood that professional sports will be played in empty arenas. Airlines have begun canceling flights. And schools are being closed. It's fair to wonder whether political events may be curtailed sooner rather than later. Even if the death toll remains relatively low, this epidemic may affect all of us in some way before it's over. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>___\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>2020 Watch runs every Monday and provides a look at the week ahead in the 2020 election.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>___\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Follow Peoples at \\u003ca href=\\\"https://twitter.com/sppeoples\\\">https://twitter.com/sppeoples\\u003c/a>.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>___\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, \\u003ca href=\\\"https://appodcasts.com/category/ground-game/\\\">“Ground Game.”\\u003c/a>\\u003c/p>\",\"mediaCount\":3,\"shortId\":\"64ca7770f30c62a742557fff64725cb8\",\"localLinkUrl\":\"https://apnews.com/64ca7770f30c62a742557fff64725cb8\",\"interactiveLinkUrl\":null,\"mediumIds\":[\"d4ab8d2c38014b1cbb35ee59c8d0c2dd\",\"3e70abb25ccf419fb4a852ccc5421940\",\"52b4f0b8ae934b519b041cea18a81a8e\"],\"interactiveLinkUrlText\":null,\"richEmbeds\":null,\"leadVideoId\":\"52b4f0b8ae934b519b041cea18a81a8e\",\"updated\":\"2020-03-09 16:49:33\",\"id\":\"urn:publicid:ap.org:64ca7770f30c62a742557fff64725cb8\",\"media\":[],\"videoContext\":null,\"tagIds\":[\"state-Mississippi\",\"state-Vermont\",\"apf-topnews\",\"state-Idaho\",\"state-Missouri\",\"apf-GeneralNews\",\"Generalelections\",\"Elections\",\"JoeBiden\",\"apf-politics\",\"Campaigns\",\"Election2020\",\"BernieSanders\",\"state-Washington\",\"state-NorthDakota\",\"state-Michigan\",\"VirusOutbreak\",\"Michigan\"],\"hasTextOverlay\":false,\"bylines\":\"By STEVE PEOPLES\",\"leadPhotoId\":\"d4ab8d2c38014b1cbb35ee59c8d0c2dd\"}],\"notificationUrl\":null,\"textColor\":null,\"teamLimit\":null,\"cardType\":\"Wire Story\",\"notificationText\":null,\"sponsorUrl\":null},{\"feed\":[],\"pollUpdated\":null,\"headlineWidget\":null,\"dividerColor\":\"#000000\",\"tagObjs\":[],\"sponsorImageUrl\":null,\"hubPeekLinkText\":null,\"borderColor\":null,\"cardTitle\":null,\"localMemberName\":null,\"notificationUpdated\":null,\"collectionTagObjs\":[],\"notificationTitle\":null,\"minimizedStoryCount\":null,\"shortId\":\"8ced60306a04eef53418f2ce6f262115\",\"allowAd\":true,\"pollWeek\":null,\"disclaimerText\":null,\"teams\":null,\"hubPeekTagName\":null,\"sponsorAttribution\":null,\"textScale\":null,\"expandedStoryCount\":null,\"hubPeekTagId\":null,\"id\":\"urn:publicid:ap.org:8ced60306a04eef53418f2ce6f262115\",\"pollId\":null,\"contents\":[{\"embedHeight\":null,\"contentSponsor\":null,\"tagObjs\":[{\"id\":\"apf-topnews\",\"name\":\"AP Top News\",\"order\":3},{\"id\":\"Detroit\",\"name\":\"Detroit\",\"order\":0},{\"id\":\"Raceandethnicity\",\"name\":\"Race and ethnicity\",\"order\":0},{\"id\":\"Michigan\",\"name\":\"Michigan\",\"order\":0},{\"id\":\"apf-politics\",\"name\":\"Politics\",\"order\":10},{\"id\":\"JoeBiden\",\"name\":\"Joe Biden\",\"order\":0},{\"id\":\"Election2020\",\"name\":\"Election 2020\",\"order\":0},{\"id\":\"BernieSanders\",\"name\":\"Bernie Sanders\",\"order\":0},{\"id\":\"apf-latinamerica\",\"name\":\"Latin America\",\"order\":8},{\"id\":\"VirusOutbreak\",\"name\":\"Virus Outbreak\",\"order\":0},{\"id\":\"apf-GeneralNews\",\"name\":\"General News\",\"order\":2},{\"id\":\"DonaldTrump\",\"name\":\"Donald Trump\",\"order\":0}],\"title\":\"US--Election 2020-Michigan\",\"localMemberName\":null,\"contentType\":\"text\",\"layoutType\":\"Small Photo\",\"embedCaption\":null,\"gcsUrl\":\"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/contents/urn:publicid:ap.org:8ced60306a04eef53418f2ce6f262115\",\"embedLinkURL\":null,\"language\":null,\"headline\":\"Dems look to Michigan primary as testing ground for November\",\"firstWords\":\"\\u003cp>DETROIT (AP) — Ask Arlene Williams about President Donald Trump's promises to bring back auto industry jobs that have evaporated across Michigan and she'll point with irony to the Chevy...\\u003c/p>\",\"published\":\"2020-03-09 04:57:41\",\"embedHTML\":null,\"sequenceNumber\":null,\"notificationId\":null,\"storyHTML\":\"\\u003cp>DETROIT (AP) — Ask Arlene Williams about President Donald Trump's promises to bring back auto industry jobs that have evaporated across Michigan and she'll point with irony to the Chevy Blazer.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>General Motors is now remaking the iconic American SUV after a lengthy hiatus — but building parts of it in Mexico and elsewhere overseas.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“These are some of the staple brands and yes, they're back,” said Williams, 49, who works at a GM plant in Romulus, Michigan, southwest of Detroit. “They're just not being made in the U.S.” \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The largest of six states voting Tuesday, Michigan could redefine \\u003ca href=\\\"https://interactives.ap.org/2020-candidates/\\\">a Democratic primary\\u003c/a> that has become a showdown between former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. But many voters are already looking ahead to November and whether Trump can again win in the state that perhaps more than any other catapulted him into the White House in 2016. \\u003c/p>\\u003cdiv class=\\\"related-story-embed\\\" id=\\\"b959ed40-43d0-11ea-ec3f-5f8156460feb\\\">\\u003c/div>\\u003cdiv class=\\\"ad-placeholder\\\">\\u003c/div>\\u003cp>For Sanders, the stakes could hardly be higher. He defeated Hillary Clinton in Michigan in 2016, emboldening his argument that he could win with a diverse coalition that drew well from young voters, working-class whites and African Americans. But it is the kind of victory he has not been able to replicate this time, and if he does not on Tuesday, any chances at the Democratic nomination may be greatly diminished.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Biden has been emphasizing the Obama administration's bailout of the auto industry, which provided an economic lifeline for GM and Chrysler and federal loans for Ford, likely saving thousands of jobs. He is also counting on continued strong support among African American voters.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>How Michigan votes will also be clarifying for November. Some see Sanders' sweeping promises to cancel student debt and provide health care for all potentially energizing young voters but not older ones wary of \\u003ca href=\\\"https://apnews.com/0f19aa284fbb49eab5a07dcd28156e83\\\">his democratic socialist ideology\\u003c/a>. Centrist and safe, Biden could do exactly the opposite, though. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Others worry that both candidates are taking black Democrats for granted. All that may add up to neither being able to carry the state against Trump. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“There's not a lot of energy, not enough energy, I would say, even for the primary,\\\" said Michigan state Rep. Sherry Gay-Dagnogo, whose district includes a large swath of northwest Detroit. She said the Democratic Party continues to use the same playbook of waiting until the last minute to do intensive community outreach — which crippled it in 2016. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Indeed, major party turnout in Wayne County, which encompasses Detroit and is strongly African American, fell by more than 64,000 votes in 2016 as compared to 2012. That's especially important since Trump leveled the Democrats' famed “blue wall” with narrow wins in states that were supposed to comfortably go to Hillary Clinton: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, which he won by just 10,704 votes out more than 4.8 million cast. \\u003c/p>\\u003cdiv class=\\\"ad-placeholder\\\">\\u003c/div>\\u003cp>Tuesday will be the first test of Democrats' ability to take them back. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>They already can point to hopeful signs.

It has begun moving to the left amid an influx of jobs bringing new residents from other parts of the state and the country, Porn said. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Sanders staged a rally Sunday in Grand Rapids and — vowing to grow the Democratic electorate by winning over young, minority and working-class voters — hit the University of Michigan and blue-collar Flint and Dearborn, home to a large concentration of Arab Americans. It is a promise he has made in other states during the primaries, but so far has largely failed to deliver.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“I am more than aware that Trump in 2016 won the state of Michigan by a small vote,\\\" Sanders said. “I do believe the people of Michigan aren’t going to make that mistake again.”\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Sanders canceled a planned trip to Mississippi to spend more time in the state this past weekend.

It also has led campaigns highlighting Trump's “broken promises\\\" when it comes to issues like restoring lost manufacturing jobs. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Still, Gay-Dagnogo said that, though the state Democratic Party opened 15 offices around Michigan, ”it's no secret\\\" Trump's reelection campaign has stood up its own operations in the same areas. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“I think sometimes we just wait for something magical to happen, opposed to making sure that there are financial resources in the community to get people out,\\\" she said. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Trump, meanwhile, has visited Michigan several times as president and points to a strong national economy as proof he kept his kept his promises to restore the state's lost jobs. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Manufacturing jobs in Michigan grew from 616,800 when Trump took office to 628,900 last December, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Announcement of the technology rules was originally planned at a health care conference in Florida, but that event was canceled over coronavirus concerns. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The long-awaited rules could take several years for consumers and patients to start seeing the practical effects. They are intended to get at one of the major problems with electronic health records: the systems of hospitals and doctors often don't 'talk' to each other, and patients struggle to get their medical information digitally transmitted, defaulting to CDs and faxed paper records.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The federal government invested more than $30 billion a decade ago to help hospitals and doctors convert to computerized records. But it never solved the problems of getting the different medical systems to seamlessly interact, and of providing a pathway for patients to easily access their records. Two rules finalized by the Trump administration aim to finally fix that.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The regulations are highly complex, and hospitals immediately objected, saying that patient privacy would be undermined.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>One rule from the HHS agency that oversees health care technology would implement congressional requirements that hospitals and other health care entities put a stop to practices that can block the digital transfer of information. Some systems don't allow screen shots or video to be shared, for example.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Another rule, from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, tries to address access problems at the patient's level, by requiring hospitals and other health care service providers to provide access to records via software used by smartphone apps, such as the ones that already handle banking and credit card transactions. Patients could literally have access to their records via the smartphone in their back pocket.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The CMS rule will also require hospitals to electronically notify a patient's outside doctors when that patient is admitted, discharged or transferred.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The hope is that easier access and authorized sharing of individuals' health care information will help prevent medical errors, cut down on duplicative tests, and make the individual patient a smarter consumer of health care services.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>But Rick Pollack, president of the American Hospital Association, said a new generation of health care apps could put the personal information of patients at risk, since the app developers would not be required to meet the same legal standards for privacy that are imposed on hospitals. “This could lead to third party apps using personal health information in ways in which patients are unaware,” Pollack said in a statement. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>CMS said it has adopted a health care privacy standard that is used in the smartphone app industry, and intends to build on it to provide consumers with a higher level of protection.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>In addition to Azar, among the top administration officials joining to make the announcement were White House health policy chief Joe Grogan, CMS Administrator Seema Verma, and Donald Rucker, the government's National Coordinator for Health Information Technology.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The administration's plan had been to make the announcement at a global health technology conference sponsored by the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society in Orlando this week. But that event was canceled due to concerns about large gatherings where travelers can unwittingly spread coronavirus.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“Sorry we can't see you in Orlando, which was our original plan here,\\\" technology coordinator Rucker told reporters.\\u003c/p>\",\"mediaCount\":6,\"shortId\":\"78f9bae088dec0debb4b044565f9a323\",\"localLinkUrl\":\"https://apnews.com/78f9bae088dec0debb4b044565f9a323\",\"interactiveLinkUrl\":null,\"mediumIds\":[\"4e63d59c8715441dbd4e2573db2fefd3\",\"8055e237f7b64783bcd847b53af33778\",\"a5769734057444309397ed377f5e50b4\",\"07604a7b9cdd47eea1fbdd4899bea868\",\"ba3c9a15aa8f4b8dacd1f34794a3990d\",\"f98b5fb426434cbaa6a634fc0eb9693b\"],\"interactiveLinkUrlText\":null,\"richEmbeds\":null,\"leadVideoId\":null,\"updated\":\"2020-03-09 18:12:12\",\"id\":\"urn:publicid:ap.org:78f9bae088dec0debb4b044565f9a323\",\"media\":[],\"videoContext\":null,\"tagIds\":[\"AlexAzar\",\"apf-Health\",\"apf-GeneralNews\",\"apf-politics\",\"apf-technology\",\"VirusOutbreak\"],\"hasTextOverlay\":false,\"bylines\":\"By RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR\",\"leadPhotoId\":\"4e63d59c8715441dbd4e2573db2fefd3\"}],\"notificationUrl\":null,\"textColor\":null,\"teamLimit\":null,\"cardType\":\"Wire Story\",\"notificationText\":null,\"sponsorUrl\":null},{\"feed\":[],\"pollUpdated\":null,\"headlineWidget\":null,\"dividerColor\":\"#000000\",\"tagObjs\":[],\"sponsorImageUrl\":null,\"hubPeekLinkText\":null,\"borderColor\":null,\"cardTitle\":null,\"localMemberName\":null,\"notificationUpdated\":null,\"collectionTagObjs\":[],\"notificationTitle\":null,\"minimizedStoryCount\":null,\"shortId\":\"c148a2866cd4e2948552402c8d3b62cc\",\"allowAd\":true,\"pollWeek\":null,\"disclaimerText\":null,\"teams\":null,\"hubPeekTagName\":null,\"sponsorAttribution\":null,\"textScale\":null,\"expandedStoryCount\":null,\"hubPeekTagId\":null,\"id\":\"urn:publicid:ap.org:c148a2866cd4e2948552402c8d3b62cc\",\"pollId\":null,\"contents\":[{\"embedHeight\":null,\"contentSponsor\":null,\"tagObjs\":[{\"id\":\"apf-topnews\",\"name\":\"AP Top News\",\"order\":6},{\"id\":\"apf-Health\",\"name\":\"Health\",\"order\":10},{\"id\":\"apf-GeneralNews\",\"name\":\"General News\",\"order\":4},{\"id\":\"apf-latinamerica\",\"name\":\"Latin America\",\"order\":10},{\"id\":\"apf-politics\",\"name\":\"Politics\",\"order\":10},{\"id\":\"apf-business\",\"name\":\"Business\",\"order\":9},{\"id\":\"Tobaccoindustryregulation\",\"name\":\"Tobacco industry regulation\",\"order\":0},{\"id\":\"Vaping\",\"name\":\"Vaping\",\"order\":0},{\"id\":\"apf-usnews\",\"name\":\"U.S. News\",\"order\":10},{\"id\":\"Publichealth\",\"name\":\"Public health\",\"order\":0}],\"title\":\"US--Juul-State Lobbying\",\"localMemberName\":null,\"contentType\":\"text\",\"layoutType\":\"Small Photo\",\"embedCaption\":null,\"gcsUrl\":\"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/contents/urn:publicid:ap.org:c148a2866cd4e2948552402c8d3b62cc\",\"embedLinkURL\":null,\"language\":null,\"headline\":\"Juul Labs sought to court AGs as teen vaping surged\",\"firstWords\":\"\\u003cp>WASHINGTON (AP) — It was a blunt warning about the dangers of youth vaping: Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr announced late last month that his state had joined 38 others to investigate whether...\\u003c/p>\",\"published\":\"2020-03-09 05:18:02\",\"embedHTML\":null,\"sequenceNumber\":null,\"notificationId\":\"urn:publicid:ap.org:c148a2866cd4e2948552402c8d3b62cc\",\"storyHTML\":\"\\u003cp>WASHINGTON (AP) — It was a blunt warning about the dangers of youth vaping: Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr announced late last month that his state had joined 38 others to investigate whether Juul Labs, the nation’s largest electronic cigarette company, promoted and sold its nicotine-heavy products to teens.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>It was a moment Juul had worked to avoid.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Ten months earlier, a team of Juul representatives met with Carr and his senior staff. They delivered a 17-page presentation laden with information about the public health potential of Juul’s combustion-free vaping devices for adult smokers and the company’s “commitment to ending youth use,” a pledge that included more rigorous retail and online sales controls.\\u003c/p>\\u003cdiv class=\\\"ad-placeholder\\\">\\u003c/div>\\u003cp>Juul had access, but it did not pay off. In that way, the company’s experience in Georgia was typical. Again and again, the company met with Carr and other state attorneys general, in many cases giving money to their campaign funds. But again and again, it was stymied in its efforts to forestall legal action.\\u003c/p>\\u003cdiv class=\\\"related-story-embed\\\" id=\\\"d0ae4240-43d0-11ea-f0f8-c9830e7978ae\\\">\\u003c/div>\\u003cp>The session in Carr’s Atlanta offices and meetings with other state AGs haven’t been previously reported. The Associated Press uncovered the influence campaign by reviewing Juul’s political donations and obtaining internal emails, meeting minutes and company records through open records requests to more than a dozen state attorneys general offices.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The documents shed new light on the unusual connection Juul forged with Iowa’s Tom Miller, the longest-serving state attorney general in U.S. history. The records show that Miller served as a behind-the-scenes adviser, helping the company respond to media requests and inquiries from government officials. Miller did not receive campaign contributions from Juul.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The documents also provide new details about the advocacy roles that the former attorneys general of Massachusetts and Rhode Island have played for the company, including lobbying state officials. All three would become important messengers as Juul stressed its efforts to keep its products away from minors while simultaneously pitching its technology as an anti-smoking tool. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Juul’s political action committee made thousands of dollars in campaign contributions to individual state attorneys general, several of whom like Carr later met with the company’s representatives, according to the records. Katie Byrd, Carr’s spokeswoman, said a $3,000 contribution Juul’s PAC made to Carr’s 2018 reelection campaign wasn’t a factor in his decision to accept the meeting.\\u003c/p>\\u003cdiv class=\\\"ad-placeholder\\\">\\u003c/div>\\u003cp>The company also donated $50,000 each to the Republican and Democratic fundraising committees that support the election of attorneys general candidates. Those donations won Juul corporate membership in both groups, a status that came with invitations to semiannual retreats and conferences attended by attorneys general and their staff. These events provide opportunities for companies to lobby state officials. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The face time with state officials hasn't prevented scrutiny, however. So far nine states have filed lawsuits against Juul and more may come in the wake of the 39-state investigation, which also is examining whether the company made misleading claims about the nicotine content in its devices.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>In an emailed response to written questions, a Juul spokesman declined to say how many state attorneys general company representatives have met with. Juul, the spokesman said, is working to earn “the trust of society by working cooperatively with attorneys general, regulators” and other officials to combat teen vaping and to steer adult smokers away from cigarettes.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The spokesman said Juul reached out to Miller and donated to other attorneys general to “listen and learn” from them on a range of issues, including cracking down on counterfeit vaping products.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Teen use of e-cigarettes has skyrocketed more than 70% since Juul’s launch in 2015, leading the Food and Drug Administration to declare an epidemic of underage vaping among teenagers. Health experts fear this unprecedented increase has hooked a generation of young people on nicotine, a highly addictive drug that is harmful to the developing brain. More than 1 in 4 high schoolers now reports vaping and Juul is the top brand, preferred by 60 percent of students, according to the latest government data. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“Juul really created this crisis,” said Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former Food and Drug Administration commissioner. “Juul created the pool of nicotine-addicted teens and I think they popularized the idea of vaping among kids.”\\u003c/p>\\u003cdiv class=\\\"hub-link-embed\\\" id=\\\"afs:Content:8644150002\\\">Full Coverage: Vaping\\u003c/div>\\u003cp>During Gottleib's tenure, the FDA raided Juul’s San Francisco headquarters, seizing more than 1,000 documents related to the company’s early sales and marketing efforts, including online promotions featuring young models and celebrities on social media sites like Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Juul’s meteoric rise has been followed by a hasty retreat in recent months, amid a nationwide backlash over vaping. Although Juul remains the dominant player in the multibillion-dollar e-cigarette market, the company has made several concessions such as pulling its mint, fruit and creme flavors from the market. The company currently sells only menthol and tobacco nicotine pods. Juul also has shuttered its social media presence and halted all U.S. advertising.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The FDA and a congressional oversight panel continue to investigate whether the company targeted young people with the flavors, design and advertising of its products. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Yet Juul may face an even bigger threat from state attorneys general, most of whom are elected independently and have broad discretion to investigate and litigate. They’re especially formidable when they band together. Dozens of them did in the 1990s with litigation against tobacco companies that led to an historic $206 billion settlement and new marketing rules that continue to govern how the industry operates. More recently, nearly all states have sued opioid drugmakers and distributors for their alleged role in the addiction epidemic tied to prescription painkillers.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“It means they’re in a world of hurt,” James Tierney, a former attorney general of Maine who now teaches at Harvard Law School, said of the multistate investigation. “The states are not buying what Juul is selling, and they’re saying, ‘We need to go deeper.’”\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The latest of the nine state lawsuits against Juul was filed last month by Massachusetts’ chief legal officer, Maura Healey. Citing company records, she alleges that Juul bought advertisements on seventeen.com, nickjr.com, the cartoonnetwork.com and other websites designed for teens and children.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Most of the state lawsuits similarly allege that Juul adopted the playbook of Big Tobacco by luring teens with colorful, youth-oriented ads, “launch parties” and product giveaways. But to date, Juul hasn’t faced the same type of coordinated, multi-state lawsuit previously used to target tobacco, pharmaceutical and financial companies.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>A TOBACCO WARRIOR IN JUUL’S CORNER\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Juul's unlikely partnership with Miller, the Iowa attorney general, began in spring 2018 as federal and state health officials grappled with the surging popularity of teen vaping. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>A Democrat with more than 37 years in office, Miller frequently mentions his leadership role in forging the 1998 settlement with the tobacco industry. He’s championed vaping’s potential to “save the lives of adult smokers.” \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The company sought Miller's counsel on how to respond to inquiries from government officials and media outlets. And even as more and more teens were vaping, he urged the public not to “overreact.” Portions of Juul's interactions with Miller were previously reported by Politico and Vice News.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>By April 2018, Miller’s staff was working to set up a call between the attorney general and Juul’s then-chief administrative officer, Ashley Gould.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“He wants a time scheduled with her and put on his calendar,” wrote Miller’s executive secretary, in an email to fellow staffers.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Two weeks later Miller’s office issued a press release titled “Juul offers opportunity to reduce smoking rates” highlighting the company’s potential to shift smokers away from cigarettes. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Days after that, Miller announced a more concrete relationship, saying he would advise Juul on how to keep its product away from young people.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>In a press statement, Miller said underage vaping was a “cause for concern,” but had “not reached panic or epidemic stages.” \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Miller’s new role involved organizing a group of experts to advise the company on underage use. Of the 13 experts Miller assembled for the group, more than half were former attorneys general, including ex-officials from Illinois and Arizona, both states that had recently requested documents from the company. Other members of the group included several researchers and one of Miller's assistants, who would later leave his job to work as a vice president for Juul.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The advisory group would hold several conference calls with Juul executives. But one former state official was not sympathetic to Juul's desire to keep its flavors readily available in stores.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“I would support banning the product if you can’t do a better job of keeping it out of the hands of children,” said former Arizona attorney general, Grant Woods, according to meeting minutes from an August call. The group held its last meeting in October 2018, according to Miller’s office.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Throughout the summer, Juul frequently reached out to Miller as negative press accounts of teenagers addicted to Juul’s flavored nicotine pods began to appear.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>In one email to Miller’s secretary, a Juul executive requested time to discuss interview requests from “three top-tier reporters” who had contacted the company. “I’d love to involve AG Miller but wanted to get your thoughts before I sent the reporters your way,” wrote Juul spokeswoman Victoria Davis.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>In the following weeks, Juul would seek Miller’s input or encourage him to field inquiries from The New York Times, CBS’ “60 Minutes” and NBC.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>In April 2019, a positive profile of Juul co-founders James Monsees and Adam Bowen penned by Miller appeared in Time magazine's annual list of the 100 most influential people. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>In an interview with AP, Miller said he became involved with the company to help “bring them into compliance” by stopping underage sales of their products and to reduce the toll of smoking on adults. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>\\\"If you were going to deal with the question of kids and e-cigarettes, you had to deal with Juul,” Miller said. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Miller rejected any suggestions that Juul benefited from its association with him and said he wouldn’t hesitate to take legal action against the company if evidence shows wrongdoing. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Miller's office hasn’t joined the multistate investigation of Juul. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Anthony Johnstone, a former assistant attorney general for Montana, said there is little precedent for such a close partnership.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“That depth of involvement by an AG with a single corporation at the center of a public health issue is uncharacteristic,” he said.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>MONEY AND MEETINGS\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>In mid-2018, as other states began to eye Juul more critically, the company gave $50,000 each to the Democratic Attorneys General Association and its GOP counterpart, the Republican Attorneys General Association, according to financial reports both groups filed with the IRS. The organizations raise money and back candidates from their respective parties that are running for the office. Neither of the groups discloses how they disperse corporate donations to candidates.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Those contributions and others would be followed by meetings with at least five state attorney generals, documents obtained through open records requests show.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>One of those meetings came in September 2018, when Juul representatives met with Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro and four of his staffers for nearly two hours to discuss how to to stop young people from using the company’s products.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Shapiro’s office had called for Juul to pull its fruit and dessert flavors from the market and reduce the high nicotine levels of its e-cigarettes. Yet the company declared these weren’t bugs, but features that adult smokers wanted, according to an eight-page memo written by a Juul executive that recounted the conversation.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>A spokeswoman for Shapiro said members of his staff “meet with companies to discuss potential violations of the laws” and to see if they will correct them. Last month Shapiro announced that Pennsylvania would sue Juul for allegedly misleading the public about the addictiveness of its e-cigarettes.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>In late October 2018, Juul’s political action committee donated more than $38,000 to incumbent state attorneys general and one first-time candidate for the office, according to a review of campaign finance records. By then, Juul was squarely in the crosshairs of FDA regulators, who were sounding the alarm on teen vaping after survey data showed e-cigarette use among high school students had jumped nearly 80% in the past year. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Not everyone wanted Juul’s money. Kwame Raoul, a Democrat elected in November 2018 to his first term as Illinois’ attorney general, rebuffed a $3,000 gift from Juul. Hanah Jubeh, a spokeswoman for Raoul’s campaign, said the contribution conflicted with his professional responsibilities and personal views. Raoul’s office announced in December it was suing Juul.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson announced last month that he'd joined the 39-state probe of Juul to examine whether the company “is following the law and not misleading people with false or misleading claims.” Previously, Wilson's reelection campaign had accepted a $3,000 donation from Juul's PAC and he'd met with company representatives in February 2019. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Wilson spokesman Robert Kittle said Juul's contribution had no bearing on the decision to grant the meeting.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>HIRED HANDS\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Juul enlisted two former state attorneys general, Patrick Lynch and Martha Coakley, as the company stepped up its outreach to current occupants of the office.

And, on Tuesday, if we stick together, we bring our friends out to vote, we're gonna win it again.”\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Back in Mississippi, Biden talked about the 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. “I underestimated that hate’s never defeated.

Fox and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick spoke to a racially diverse crowd Sunday at a get-out-the-vote rally for Biden at historically black Tougaloo College in Jackson. “Joe had President Obama’s back for every minute of those eight years in office,” said Fox, who also campaigned for Biden in South Carolina before that state’s primary. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>As Jackson was endorsing Sanders, meanwhile, Biden picked up the coveted endorsement of California Sen.

She is the latest dropout from the Democratic race for president to line up behind Biden in his matchup against Sanders.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>On Monday, former presidential candidate Sen. Cory Booker also endorsed Biden, further solidifying the Democratic establishment's move to close circles around Biden after his Super Tuesday success. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Despite that, Jackson said he chose Sanders after the campaign offered responses on 13 issues Jackson raised, including protecting voting rights, increasing funding for historically black colleges and universities and committing to putting African Americans on the Supreme Court, according to a statement released by the Sanders' campaign. He also said Biden's campaign hadn't approached him about an endorsement but Sanders' did. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Speaking at the rally, Jackson brushed aside some voters’ uneasiness about Sanders’ avowed democratic socialist ideology, saying Sanders will defend democratic values and that issues important to poor and minority people wouldn't have been prioritized in the presidential race without him.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp> “Thank God for Bernie Sanders,” Jackson said. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>___\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Weissert reported from Grand Rapids, Michigan.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>___\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, \\u003ca href=\\\"https://appodcasts.com/category/ground-game/\\\">“Ground Game.”\\u003c/a>\\u003c/p>\",\"mediaCount\":12,\"shortId\":\"e7be191b236552ce1b116b4cba6544ab\",\"localLinkUrl\":\"https://apnews.com/e7be191b236552ce1b116b4cba6544ab\",\"interactiveLinkUrl\":null,\"mediumIds\":[\"b8adffd2ab0a4bf496aa39f662b710fa\",\"b83a98326fff4edbaefe28e368a53220\",\"061e9fa53536485ca1543a2897e7b528\",\"0bef5f901fd245f9bd748187ebf312ff\",\"0d2d1733ee734ac8984666a528a8b733\",\"16c86926568d47bcbb45f2782d8a34df\",\"8e693e4c16b04808a29092b0e497dfdc\",\"3fcbfc129b774d2a950cde51c4561758\",\"1d653cde3a5249009fb05850239bd69f\",\"01544a94cfa1467ba4d5eb27e57fef60\",\"74471c5b00ff4dcf859680596900820d\",\"c111ae5c4b9745448eb1be336a8af4de\"],\"interactiveLinkUrlText\":null,\"richEmbeds\":null,\"leadVideoId\":\"01544a94cfa1467ba4d5eb27e57fef60\",\"updated\":\"2020-03-09 11:42:52\",\"id\":\"urn:publicid:ap.org:e7be191b236552ce1b116b4cba6544ab\",\"media\":[],\"videoContext\":null,\"tagIds\":[\"state-Mississippi\",\"BennieThompson\",\"Raceandethnicity\",\"apf-GeneralNews\",\"apf-politics\",\"JoeBiden\",\"Campaigns\",\"Election2020\",\"DerrickJohnson\",\"BernieSanders\",\"JesseJackson\",\"state-Michigan\",\"Voting\",\"Michigan\",\"apf-religion\"],\"hasTextOverlay\":false,\"bylines\":\"By EMILY WAGSTER PETTUS and WILL WEISSERT\",\"leadPhotoId\":\"b8adffd2ab0a4bf496aa39f662b710fa\"}],\"notificationUrl\":null,\"textColor\":null,\"teamLimit\":null,\"cardType\":\"Wire Story\",\"notificationText\":null,\"sponsorUrl\":null},{\"feed\":[],\"pollUpdated\":null,\"headlineWidget\":false,\"dividerColor\":null,\"tagObjs\":[],\"sponsorImageUrl\":null,\"hubPeekLinkText\":null,\"borderColor\":null,\"cardTitle\":null,\"localMemberName\":null,\"notificationUpdated\":null,\"collectionTagObjs\":[],\"notificationTitle\":null,\"minimizedStoryCount\":null,\"shortId\":\"0afe0883f14ca85a676c323c277dbf3a\",\"allowAd\":true,\"pollWeek\":null,\"disclaimerText\":null,\"teams\":null,\"hubPeekTagName\":null,\"sponsorAttribution\":null,\"textScale\":null,\"expandedStoryCount\":null,\"hubPeekTagId\":null,\"id\":\"urn:publicid:ap.org:0afe0883f14ca85a676c323c277dbf3a\",\"pollId\":null,\"contents\":[{\"embedHeight\":null,\"contentSponsor\":null,\"tagObjs\":[{\"id\":\"Education\",\"name\":\"Education\",\"order\":0},{\"id\":\"LamarAlexander\",\"name\":\"Lamar Alexander\",\"order\":0},{\"id\":\"apf-Health\",\"name\":\"Health\",\"order\":10},{\"id\":\"apf-GeneralNews\",\"name\":\"General News\",\"order\":1},{\"id\":\"APFactCheck\",\"name\":\"AP Fact Check\",\"order\":0},{\"id\":\"apf-politics\",\"name\":\"Politics\",\"order\":10},{\"id\":\"apf-business\",\"name\":\"Business\",\"order\":10},{\"id\":\"DonaldTrump\",\"name\":\"Donald Trump\",\"order\":0},{\"id\":\"VirusOutbreak\",\"name\":\"Virus Outbreak\",\"order\":0},{\"id\":\"MichaelPence\",\"name\":\"Michael Pence\",\"order\":0},{\"id\":\"Publichealth\",\"name\":\"Public health\",\"order\":0},{\"id\":\"Economy\",\"name\":\"Economy\",\"order\":0}],\"title\":\"US--Fact Check-Week\",\"localMemberName\":null,\"contentType\":\"text\",\"layoutType\":\"Small Photo\",\"embedCaption\":null,\"gcsUrl\":\"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/contents/urn:publicid:ap.org:0afe0883f14ca85a676c323c277dbf3a\",\"embedLinkURL\":null,\"language\":null,\"headline\":\"AP FACT CHECK: Trump's rosy take on govt's handling of virus\",\"firstWords\":\"\\u003cp>WASHINGTON (AP) — As the stock market convulses, airline schedules buckle and businesses worry their overseas supply lines will snap, President Donald Trump is looking on the sunny side of an...\\u003c/p>\",\"published\":\"2020-03-09 05:01:34\",\"embedHTML\":null,\"sequenceNumber\":null,\"notificationId\":null,\"storyHTML\":\"\\u003cp>WASHINGTON (AP) — As the stock market convulses, airline schedules buckle and businesses worry their overseas supply lines will snap, President Donald Trump is looking on the sunny side of an economy clouded by the coronavirus.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>For weeks he's played down the consequences of the public health emergency and also misleadingly played up his poll ratings even as his agencies scramble to manage the crisis.

In fact, the poll was conducted weeks before, in early to mid-February, during the beginning stages of the U.S. outbreak. It was before anyone had died from COVID-19 or the first cases of community transmission surfaced.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The Gallup poll, conducted Feb. 3-16, found 77% of Americans were very confident (31%) or somewhat confident (46%) that the U.S. government would be able to handle a virus outbreak. That tracks closely with a poll conducted Feb. 13-16 by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, which also found about 3 in 4 Americans were at least moderately confident that U.S. health officials could handle the job.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Gallup also reported Americans were more confident than they were in previous administrations’ ability to deal with Zika, Ebola, swine flu and bird flu, based on an average of polls during those times.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>But the coronavirus polls were conducted when deaths from COVID-19 were still happening abroad, rather than on U.S. soil. Since then, Trump appointed Vice President Mike Pence on Feb. 26 to lead the coronavirus response as the U.S. stock market slid over epidemic fears and the first U.S. cases emerged of community transmission that didn’t involve overseas travel. \\u003c/p>\\u003cdiv class=\\\"ad-placeholder\\\">\\u003c/div>\\u003cp>To date, there are now at least 21 U.S. deaths and more than 500 infections scattered over more than 30 states as the federal government struggles to meet demand for diagnostic testing kits.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>___\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>TRUMP: “We're going to have Americans staying home instead of going and spending the money in other countries.

Many, many more sites. Many, many more people.

No such regulation existed.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The Trump administration’s action last Saturday only undid a policy that its own Food and Drug Administration put in place. The new action lets labs develop and use coronavirus diagnostic tests before the agency reviews them. Previously, the FDA had only authorized use of a government test developed by the CDC.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>FDA guidance drafted during the Obama administration called for tighter regulation of so-called laboratory-developed tests, a market traditionally not overseen by the agency.

They say a vaccine is probably more than a year away at best and there are no special treatments for COVID-19. The notion of a quick “cure” is not in their vocabulary as they focus on trying to help people avoid getting the disease in the first place.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>What’s actually happening: Studies have begun in COVID-19 patients in parts of the world to see if certain antiviral medications could help treat the infection. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Today, there are no proven treatments. In China, scientists have been testing a combination of HIV drugs against the new coronavirus, as well as an experimental drug named remdesivir that was in development to fight Ebola. In the U.S., the University of Nebraska Medical Center also began testing remdesivir in some Americans who were found to have COVID-19 after being evacuated from a cruise ship in Japan.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>It's not known how soon such studies will answer whether any of the drugs help.

In fact, the poll was conducted weeks before, in early to mid-February, during the beginning stages of the U.S. outbreak. It was before anyone had died from COVID-19 or the first cases of community transmission surfaced.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The Gallup poll, conducted Feb. 3-16, found 77% of Americans were very confident (31%) or somewhat confident (46%) that the U.S. government would be able to handle a virus outbreak. That tracks closely with a poll conducted Feb. 13-16 by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, which also found about 3 in 4 Americans were at least moderately confident that U.S. health officials could handle the job.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Gallup also reported Americans were more confident than they were in previous administrations’ ability to deal with Zika, Ebola, swine flu and bird flu, based on an average of polls during those times.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>But the coronavirus polls were conducted when deaths from COVID-19 were still happening abroad, rather than on U.S. soil. Since then, Trump appointed Vice President Mike Pence on Feb. 26 to lead the coronavirus response as the U.S. stock market slid over epidemic fears and the first U.S. cases emerged of community transmission that didn’t involve overseas travel. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>To date, there are now at least 21 U.S. deaths — with all but three victims in Washington state — and more than 500 infections scattered over more than 30 states as the federal government struggles to meet demand for diagnostic testing kits and Trump at times offers \\u003ca href=\\\"https://apnews.com/7b4368cae934785657acac1f09873505\\\">contrary messaging\\u003c/a> to his federal health experts.\\u003c/p>\\u003cdiv class=\\\"ad-placeholder\\\">\\u003c/div>\\u003cp>Trump claims higher poll ratings than previous administrations got when handling virus outbreaks. But early in the swine flu outbreak in May 2009, when Barack Obama was president, 3 in 4 Americans had confidence in the government’s management of the crisis, according to Gallup. That was about the same level of approval expressed for the government’s handling of the coronavirus in early February. Confidence in the 2009 response declined as the consequences worsened.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>As such, Trump’s verdict of having the “highest” ratings ever is premature and misleading.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>___\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>AP Director of Public Opinion Research Emily Swanson contributed to this report.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>___ \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>EDITOR'S NOTE — A look at the veracity of claims by political figures.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>___ \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Find AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck\\u003c/p>\",\"mediaCount\":1,\"shortId\":\"7c07f069fdbcfd256703ce7bdf6363fb\",\"localLinkUrl\":\"https://apnews.com/7c07f069fdbcfd256703ce7bdf6363fb\",\"interactiveLinkUrl\":null,\"mediumIds\":[\"d3965e06b84141529663e564a6addcc1\"],\"interactiveLinkUrlText\":null,\"richEmbeds\":[],\"leadVideoId\":null,\"updated\":\"2020-03-08 18:36:29\",\"id\":\"urn:publicid:ap.org:7c07f069fdbcfd256703ce7bdf6363fb\",\"media\":[],\"videoContext\":\"irst cases of community transmission surfaced.\\u003c/p>\",\"tagIds\":[\"apf-Health\",\"apf-GeneralNews\",\"Flu\",\"apf-politics\",\"Swineflu\",\"VirusOutbreak\",\"MichaelPence\",\"DonaldTrump\"],\"hasTextOverlay\":false,\"bylines\":\"By HOPE YEN\",\"leadPhotoId\":\"d3965e06b84141529663e564a6addcc1\"}],\"notificationUrl\":null,\"textColor\":null,\"teamLimit\":null,\"cardType\":\"Wire Story\",\"notificationText\":null,\"sponsorUrl\":null},{\"feed\":[],\"pollUpdated\":null,\"headlineWidget\":false,\"dividerColor\":null,\"tagObjs\":[],\"sponsorImageUrl\":null,\"hubPeekLinkText\":null,\"borderColor\":null,\"cardTitle\":null,\"localMemberName\":null,\"notificationUpdated\":null,\"collectionTagObjs\":[],\"notificationTitle\":null,\"minimizedStoryCount\":null,\"shortId\":\"a7f6a58d8e0509a28947bf247c0cfd5c\",\"allowAd\":true,\"pollWeek\":null,\"disclaimerText\":null,\"teams\":null,\"hubPeekTagName\":null,\"sponsorAttribution\":null,\"textScale\":null,\"expandedStoryCount\":null,\"hubPeekTagId\":null,\"id\":\"urn:publicid:ap.org:a7f6a58d8e0509a28947bf247c0cfd5c\",\"pollId\":null,\"contents\":[{\"embedHeight\":null,\"contentSponsor\":null,\"tagObjs\":[{\"id\":\"apf-religion\",\"name\":\"Religion\",\"order\":4},{\"id\":\"apf-Health\",\"name\":\"Health\",\"order\":0},{\"id\":\"apf-GeneralNews\",\"name\":\"General News\",\"order\":8},{\"id\":\"apf-politics\",\"name\":\"Politics\",\"order\":10},{\"id\":\"JoeBiden\",\"name\":\"Joe Biden\",\"order\":0},{\"id\":\"Campaigns\",\"name\":\"Campaigns\",\"order\":0},{\"id\":\"Election2020\",\"name\":\"Election 2020\",\"order\":0},{\"id\":\"BernieSanders\",\"name\":\"Bernie Sanders\",\"order\":0},{\"id\":\"VirusOutbreak\",\"name\":\"Virus Outbreak\",\"order\":0},{\"id\":\"Publichealth\",\"name\":\"Public health\",\"order\":0},{\"id\":\"DonaldTrump\",\"name\":\"Donald Trump\",\"order\":0}],\"title\":\"US--Election 2020-Democrats-The Latest\",\"localMemberName\":null,\"contentType\":\"text\",\"layoutType\":\"Small Photo\",\"embedCaption\":null,\"gcsUrl\":\"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/contents/urn:publicid:ap.org:a7f6a58d8e0509a28947bf247c0cfd5c\",\"embedLinkURL\":null,\"language\":null,\"headline\":\"The Latest: Sanders assessing big events in wake of outbreak\",\"firstWords\":\"\\u003cp>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on the 2020 presidential campaign (all times local):\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>2:20 p.m.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Bernie Sanders says his campaign is gauging when it may become necessary to cancel the large...\\u003c/p>\",\"published\":\"2020-03-08 16:08:11\",\"embedHTML\":null,\"sequenceNumber\":null,\"notificationId\":null,\"storyHTML\":\"\\u003cp>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on the 2020 presidential campaign (all times local):\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>2:20 p.m.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Bernie Sanders says his campaign is gauging when it may become necessary to cancel the large campaign rallies that public health experts say could be breeding grounds to spread the potentially deadly respiratory illness.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The Democratic presidential candidate says that public health “obviously” comes first so he remains in constant contact with public health officials about holding events.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Federal health authorities have been advising older people and those with medical conditions in particular to avoid crowded spaces.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>But that so far hasn’t led President Donald Trump or his two remaining major Democratic presidential rivals to cut back on big campaign events.

If the vaccine revs up the immune system, the samples in that dish -- blood drawn from immunized mice -- would change color. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Minutes ticked by, and finally they started glowing blue.\\u003c/p>\\u003cdiv class=\\\"ad-placeholder\\\">\\u003c/div>\\u003cp>“Especially at moments like this, everyone crowds around,” said Kizzmekia Corbett, an NIH research fellow leading the vaccine development. When her team sent word of the positive results, “it was absolutely amazing.”\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Dozens of research groups around the world are racing to create a vaccine as COVID-19 cases continue to grow. Importantly, they’re pursuing different types of vaccines — shots developed from new technologies that not only are faster to make than traditional inoculations but might prove more potent. Some researchers even aim for temporary vaccines, such as shots that might guard people's health a month or two at a time while longer-lasting protection is developed.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“Until we test them in humans we have absolutely no idea what the immune response will be,” cautioned vaccine expert Dr. Judith O’Donnell, infectious disease chief at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center. “Having a lot of different vaccines -- with a lot of different theories behind the science of generating immunity -- all on a parallel track really ultimately gives us the best chance of getting something successful.”\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>First-step testing in small numbers of young, healthy volunteers is set to start soon. There's no chance participants could get infected from the shots, because they don’t contain the virus itself. The goal is purely to check that the vaccines show no worrisome side effects, setting the stage for larger tests of whether they protect. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>First in line is the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle. It is preparing to test 45 volunteers with different doses of shots co-developed by NIH and Moderna Inc. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Next, Inovio Pharmaceuticals aims to begin safety tests of its vaccine candidate next month in a few dozen volunteers at the University of Pennsylvania and a testing center in Kansas City, Missouri, followed by a similar study in China and South Korea.\\u003c/p>\\u003cdiv class=\\\"ad-placeholder\\\">\\u003c/div>\\u003cp>Even if initial safety tests go well, “you’re talking about a year to a year and a half” before any vaccine could be ready for widespread use, stressed Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>That still would be a record-setting pace. But manufacturers know the wait -- required because it takes additional studies of thousands of people to tell if a vaccine truly protects and does no harm -- is hard for a frightened public.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“I can really genuinely understand everybody’s frustration and maybe even confusion,” said Kate Broderick, Inovio’s research and development chief. “You can do everything as fast as possible, but you can’t circumvent some of these vital processes.” \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>___\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>BEHIND-THE-SCENES IN NIH’S LAB \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The new coronavirus is studded with a protein aptly named “spike” that lets the virus burrow into human cells. Block that protein, and people won’t get infected. That makes “spike” the target of most vaccine research.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Not so long ago, scientists would have had to grow the virus itself to create a vaccine. The NIH is using a new method that skips that step. Researchers instead copy the section of the virus’ genetic code that contains the instructions for cells to create the spike protein, and let the body become a mini-factory.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Inject a vaccine containing that code, called messenger RNA or mRNA, and people’s cells produce some harmless spike protein. Their immune system spots the foreign protein and makes antibodies to attack it. The body would then be primed to react quickly if the real virus ever comes along.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Corbett's team had a head start. Because they’d spent years trying to develop a vaccine against MERS, a cousin of the new virus, they knew how to make spike proteins stable enough for immunization, and sent that key ingredient to Moderna to brew up doses.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>How to tell it’s a good candidate to test in people? \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Corbett’s team grew spike protein in the lab — lots of it -- and stored it frozen in vials. Then with the first research doses of vaccine Moderna dubbed “mRNA-1273,” the NIH researchers immunized dozens of mice. Days later, they started collecting blood samples to check if the mice were producing antibodies against that all-important spike protein. One early test: Mix the mouse samples with thawed spike protein and various color-eliciting trackers, and if antibodies are present, they bind to the protein and glow.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Corbett says the work couldn’t have moved so quickly had it not been for years of behind-the-scenes lab testing of a possible MERS vaccine that works the same way.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“I think about it a lot, how many of the little experimental questions we did not have to belabor” this time around, she said. When she saw the first promising mouse tests, “I felt like there was a beginning of all of this coming full circle.”\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>___\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>INOVIO’S APPROACH\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Inovio’s approach is similar -- again using genetic code, in this case packaged inside a piece of synthetic DNA that acts as the vaccine. One advantage Broderick cites for a DNA approach is that unlike many types of vaccines, it may not need refrigeration.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>A MERS vaccine that Inovio designed the same way passed initial safety studies in people, paving the way for testing the new COVID-19 vaccine candidate. Inovio is doing similar animal testing to look for presumably protective antibodies.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>While it gets ready for human safety tests, Inovio also is prepping for another piece of evidence — what's called a challenge study. Vaccinated animals will be put in a special high-containment lab and exposed to the new coronavirus to see if they get infected or not.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>___\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>PLACEHOLDER VACCINES?\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is exploring a different approach: simply injecting people with coronavirus-fighting antibodies instead of teaching the body to make its own. This method could provide temporary protection against infection or work as a treatment for someone already infected. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Regeneron vaccinated mice genetically engineered to make human antibodies. From small blood samples, researchers culled hundreds of different antibodies, and now they're teasing out which seem most potent against that notorious spike protein, said Christos Kyratsous, Regeneron’s chief of infectious disease research.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Regeneron developed this “monoclonal antibody” approach as a life-saving treatment for Ebola. Last year, it performed a successful safety test of experimental antibodies designed to fight MERS. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The difference between using antibodies as a treatment or a vaccine? Low-dose shots in the arm every few months might give enough antibodies to temporarily ward off infection, while treatment likely would require far higher doses delivered intravenously, Kyratsous said. Regeneron is pursuing both, and hopes to begin first-step safety testing in early summer.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“The antibodies are the same,” he said. “We would like to have an antibody that is as flexible in administration as possible.”\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Whichever of these approaches, or others in the pipeline, pan out, NIH’s Corbett said scientists one day hope to have vaccines on the shelf that could be used against entire families of viruses. One frustration when scientists have to start from scratch is that outbreaks too often are waning by the time vaccine candidates are ready for widespread testing.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“This is the fastest we have gone,” Fauci said of the NIH’s vaccine candidate, although he warned it might not be fast enough.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Still, he called it “quite conceivable” that COVID-19 “will go beyond just a season, and come back and recycle next year. In that case, we hope to have a vaccine.”\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>___\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.ap.org/press-releases/2018/ap-hhmi-expand-collaboration-to-bolster-health-science-coverage\\\">support\\u003c/a> from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

They are moved by Sanders' vision for the country — of a place where everyone has health care, college is free and rich people and corporations don't have more political influence than teachers and students — and his consistency on the issues.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>They don't believe his ideas are unrealistic or unaffordable. To them, the main argument that President Donald Trump and others have used against Sanders — that he's a “socialist” who wants to give everything away for free — isn't at all scary and may be a point in Sanders' favor.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Those young voters remain the backbone of Sanders' effort, though they weren't enough for him to stop Biden from leapfrogging him in the delegate count on Super Tuesday. Sanders won four states out of 14, including California, with support from 57% of voters under 30, according to AP VoteCast surveys of voters across eight of the states that voted. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>But those young voters made up just 15% of the vote, putting pressure on Sanders to increase that vote share or broaden his appeal — or both — as the race moves on to Michigan, Washington, Missouri, Mississippi on Tuesday and elsewhere after that.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The biggest delegate haul this week will be Michigan. Sanders defeated Hillary Clinton there in 2016, thanks in part to strong support in counties that are home to colleges such as the University of Michigan and Michigan State University.\\u003c/p>\\u003cdiv class=\\\"ad-placeholder\\\">\\u003c/div>\\u003cp>A big part of Sanders' success is that he's empowered younger voters and made them feel they are part of a movement in a way few politicians have done since Barack Obama in 2008, said John Della Volpe,director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Their potential political power is notable. Generation Z — those between 18 and 23 — make up 1 in 10 eligible voters,and is the only generation that has grown by percentage of eligible voting population since 2016, according to the Pew Research Center. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>AP VoteCast shows these young voters more likely than those older to be liberal ideologically. Sixty percent of voters under 30 across eight Super Tuesday states surveyed described themselves as liberal and 39% said they are “very liberal.” But they have historically turned out to vote at much lower rates than older voters, a trend that has continued this primary season. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“If they all voted at close to the proportion of older voters it's a completely different country,” Della Volpe said. \\u003c/p>\\u003cdiv class=\\\"hub-link-embed\\\" id=\\\"afs:Content:8587721231\\\">Full Coverage: Election 2020\\u003c/div>\\u003cp>Sanders said at a post-Super Tuesday news conference that his campaign hasn't been as successful as he'd hoped at getting young people out to vote. In a sign he's ramping up those efforts in Michigan, he canceled events in Mississippi to spend more time in Michigan, including a Sunday night rally in Ann Arbor, hosted by the university's chapter of Students for Bernie. Sanders drew almost 6,000 people to a rally on the campus in 2016, days before his surprise win in the state over Clinton.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“The vision he’s talking about is of the world that we want,\\\" said Emily Moos, 22, who works as an environmental organizer registering young people to vote in Ann Arbor. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Moos was among those at the Super Tuesday gathering who believe the influence of money, particularly from fossil fuel companies and other corporations, has corrupted U.S. politics, affecting everything from the climate crisis to health care and the minimum wage. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Sanders has raised over $120 million this election cycle, including more than $25 million in January, from over 1.5 million people while refusing money from corporations and political action committees. That's a big reason Sanders' supporters are choosing him over rivals such as Biden, who they say is influenced by PACs and large-dollar donors. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“How can we trust anybody if they have to kind of kneel to these corporate entities?\\\" said Matthew Rodriguez, 29, who is studying in the University of Michigan's school of social work. \\\"We can trust Bernie. When he says he’ll fight for these things, we know he’ll fight for it no matter what.” \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>That extends to health care and Sanders' push for “Medicare for All,” which his rivals have described as a pipe dream. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Jonah Hahn, 25, said he saw firsthand how it could work when he was living in Spain for a fellowship. That country's national health care system provides universal coverage and access to free health care for Spanish nationals. In the private insurance market, Hahn paid $60 per month for everything, with no copays. Back in the U.S. he pays a $50 copay to see a specialist, after a $300 monthly premium. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“Nothing convinces you about the importance of universal health care like living in a country that has it,” said Hahn, who considers himself a democratic socialist. “It’s not like I needed to be radicalized, but when you actually see it, you say 'OK, Spain has certain political issues, but no one is debating whether their health care system works or not.’” \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>What if Sanders isn't the nominee?

Sanders has run for office as in Independent and identifies himself as a democratic socialist.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“If you want a nominee who’ll bring the party together, who will run on a positive progressive vision for the future, not turn this primary into a campaign of negative attacks — because that will only reelect Donald Trump if we go that route — if you want that, join us,‘’ Biden said.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Winning, he added, “means uniting America, not sowing more division and anger.‘‘\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The former vice president also knocked Sanders’ weeks of suggestions that he is the candidate who can prompt record voter turnout in November and defeat Trump, saying that actually “we’re the campaign that’s going to do that.”\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Sanders argues that no Democrat will win the presidency “with the same-old, same-old politics of yesteryear.”\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>And in a sign of how biting the contest may become, Sanders supporters — including his campaign manager — raised questions about Biden’s stamina after he gave a seven minute speech in St. Louis. At his second stop, in Kansas City, he again gave a truncated version of his stump speech, speaking for a little over 15 minutes.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir issued a tweet noting Biden’s short speaking time and highlighting the fact that Sanders had three campaign events on his schedule, “each speaking engagement extending for close to an hour.”\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>That prompted swift online push-back from Biden allies. Democratic strategist Guy Cecil, who leads the party's largest outside spending group, tweeted, “Spreading conspiracy theories online won’t help your candidate” but “it will help Donald Trump win in November.” \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>But the focus on Biden’s age is somewhat ironic given that the 78-year-old Sanders is actually a year older than Biden. Sanders, who has served in Congress since 1991, says he’s bucked the establishment of both parties with decades with unpopular stands that now give him the credibility to lead a political revolution “from the bottom up.”\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Sanders is pledging to increase Democratic turnout by drawing younger voters, minorities and working class people to the polls even though they tend to vote in lower concentrations than many other Americans. Strong support among Hispanics lifted Sanders to victories in Nevada and California, but Biden \\u003ca href=\\\"https://apnews.com/2bf0110ed8081d76c2491cbe65a553ef\\\">trounced him\\u003c/a> in South Carolina and throughout much of the Deep South that voted during last week's Super Tuesday. Biden especially ran up the score with African Americans. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Some activists are disappointed that a once diverse field of women and minorities has dwindled to two white men in their late 70s. But in Dearborn, Sanders, who is Jewish, said he was inspired by so many Arab Americans backing him. “I see people coming together from so many different backgrounds. It is beautiful,” he said. He also joked about his age, saying, “Sometimes people say, ‘Bernie, you’re 33 years of age. How do you keep going?’\\\"\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Top advisers expect Sanders to finish strong in Washington. Still, he canceled a trip to Mississippi to focus on Michigan, Tuesday's largest prize. He made a stop in Chicago's Grant Park on Saturday afternoon, and declared that he has a different vision than Biden, “And the American people are going to hear about it.” Sanders will spend the rest of the weekend in Michigan, while Biden is in Missouri and Mississippi. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Sanders said repeatedly that he and Biden are friends and that, if he's not the nominee, he will support Biden against Trump. But, he added, “In the remaining months, I intend to make it clear what my views are and what Joe Biden’s are.” \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The campaign is being conducted as the country is contending with the coronavirus outbreak. The AFL-CIO said Saturday that it was canceling a scheduled presidential forum set for Thursday in Orlando in the week before the Florida primary.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Sanders has used many of his Michigan events to hammer Biden's past support for the North American Free Trade Agreement, arguing that it moved high-paying U.S. jobs to Mexico and China while devastating manufacturing in a state dominated by the auto industry. He's focused on Biden's years in the Senate, when Biden backed not only trade agreements and the U.S.-led war in Iraq, but also a ban on using federal funds to pay for abortions. Biden announced this summer that he was reversing his position on that, but Sanders said that wasn't enough. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>\\\"I think we need a candidate that can be trusted on this issue. I am proud to tell you that I am 100% pro choice,” Sanders says. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The pair are also circling each other on the airwaves. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Biden saw a surge of donor support after South Carolina and Super Tuesday, and his campaign announced that it was spending $12 million on a \\u003ca href=\\\"https://apnews.com/87d78e56dc066a885eafb53f7a228bfb\\\">six-state ad buy\\u003c/a> in places voting Tuesday and the following week. It was his largest single advertising effort of the 2020 campaign.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>He is using two television and digital ads, one promoting his relationship with President Barack Obama, the other a new effort to counter a Sanders attack on Biden's past record on Social Security. It's a \\u003ca href=\\\"https://apnews.com/31c432f20acba807a569c7004abaf473\\\">criticism\\u003c/a> Sanders has used for months. And though he hasn't mentioned it as frequently while campaigning in Michigan, he has released his own ad airing in states voting Tuesday and the following week dinging Biden on Social Security. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>It features a past clip of the former vice president saying, “When I argued if we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security.” Biden's counter spot has a narrator saying, “Biden will increase Social Security benefits and protect it for generations to come.\\\"\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>___\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Jaffe reported from Kansas City, Mo.

(AP) — Nearly two years after suburbanites helped drive a Democratic surge, there are clear signs these voters are engaged and primed to vote Democratic again. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Turnout in the Democratic presidential primary has been strong across suburban counties, from northern Virginia to Southern California, that fueled the 2018 wave. In several key counties, turnout has exceeded that of four years ago. In some cases, it has bested the party's recent high water marks reached during the 2008 primary battle between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>That has been particularly good news now for Joe Biden. The former vice president, who's running as a moderate, consensus candidate, soared to the top of the Democratic field this past week, showing strength in places such as Fairfax County in Virginia, and Mecklenburg County in North Carolina. Many suburban Democrats said they are motivated by their desire to oust Trump and a fear that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Biden's chief primary rival, is a riskier bet. \\u003c/p>\\u003cdiv class=\\\"ad-placeholder\\\">\\u003c/div>\\u003cp>“My main goal is to not have Trump get reelected,” Gail Hayes, a 67-year-old retired child care provider, said outside a coffee shop in Burnsville, Minnesota, a Twin Cities suburb.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Hayes noted that she's ideologically more aligned with progressives such as Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator who dropped out of the race Thursday. But Hayes described herself as pragmatic and said she voted for Biden because she thinks he can win. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“I wanted to pick someone more moderate,” she said. \\\"I really didn’t decide until a couple hours before I voted.”\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The Democratic turnout overall has risen, with Iowa, North Carolina and Texas topping 2016 levels, but not the 2008 spike. Virginia was an exception, jumping from 986,000 votes in 2008 to 1.3 million. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Much of that increase is coming in American suburbs that will be pivotal to the November general election.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Consider Burnsville, part of once-reliably Republican Dakota County. The sprawling community has grown more racially diverse and more Democratic in recent years. The strip mall where Hayes grabbed a coffee also housed a halal grocer linked with an African restaurant and a Latin grocer linked with a taco shop.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>A surge of anti-Trump sentiment in the area helped Democrats flip a Republican-held House seat in 2018. Now Dakota County is among the places Trump's campaign must pick up ground if it wants to make good on its promise to win Minnesota in November. \\u003c/p>\\u003cdiv class=\\\"ad-placeholder\\\">\\u003c/div>\\u003cp>“The suburbs have been a killing zone for Republicans in the Trump era,” said GOP strategist Alex Conant, a top adviser on Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's failed 2016 presidential campaign. Conant said Republicans must do better to attract young families and professionals or Democratic gains in suburbs will almost certainly continue. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The opening contests of the Democratic presidential primary, including 14 held Tuesday, brought few signs that the Trump backlash in the suburbs has ebbed. In a dozen counties with swing suburban communities, Democrats cast more ballots than they did four years ago, an analysis found. In nine of the 12 counties, the vote totals eclipsed 2008.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The numbers are a sign of both the energy and the population growth driving Democrats' suburban strength. Both were evident last Tuesday in Virginia, where Democrats have won three straight election cycles since Trump was elected, powered largely by voters in suburban areas. That success includes every statewide race and flipping partisan control of the Legislature and congressional delegation.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>In Chesterfield County, just south of Richmond, young families have flocked to new subdivisions, shifting the area's politics at a stunning pace. The county voted for Trump in 2016 but has since helped elect Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam in 2017, sent Democrat Abigail Spanberger to Congress in 2018, and seated a new Democratic state senator in 2019. This past Tuesday, 25,000 more Democrats voted compared with the Democratic primary in 2016. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Voting was up for Democrats in Texas' Dallas County, another area that flipped a House seat to Democrats in 2018, though turnout was not as high as when Obama was on the ballot.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>In Virginia, about two-thirds of suburban voters describe themselves as moderate or conservative, rather than liberal, as do about 60% of suburban voters in California, Colorado, Minnesota, North Carolina and Texas, according to AP VoteCast surveys of voters in eight states that held primaries last Tuesday. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>That moderate tilt proved to be an advantage for Biden over Sanders, whom many suburban voters said they viewed as less likely to beat Trump. Biden soundly beat Sanders in Dakota County, Chesterfield County and Fairfax. In California, a state Sanders won, he beat Biden in suburban havens of Orange and Riverside counties, although by relatively narrow margins. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Michael McDade, 62, a Democrat who cast his ballot in Cary, North Carolina, home of the Research Triangle Park area, said he voted for Biden as a matter of pragmatism rather than preference. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>\\\"I just felt like he had the best chance of consolidating Democrats behind him and the best chance of beating Trump,” he said. The 40-year resident has watched Wake County swell with out-of-state newcomers filling jobs in the booming pharmaceutical and technology industries and surrounding universities, and making the area “much more cosmopolitan.” \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Progressives argue that the party's focus on the suburbs and its cluster of moderate and older voters risks leaving behind the young voters, Latinos and liberals at the core of Sanders' coalition. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“A campaign that is not inspiring to a rising American electorate, especially of young voters, can be a real challenge for Democrats,” said Neil Sroka at the pro-Sanders Democracy for America. Democrats' focus shouldn't be on the so-called swing voter who shifts between Republicans and Democrats, \\\"but those who swing in and out of the electorate,” he said.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Indeed, Sanders' supporters stand out for their skepticism of most other candidates in the race. At least half of his voters across eight states surveyed said they would be unhappy with Biden, according to VoteCast.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>At the Burnsville coffee shop, Sanders supporter Ali Sugule, 39, wasn’t enthusiastic about Biden. Nevertheless, the Somali American who considers himself a progressive said he “will back up anybody” the Democrats ultimately nominate.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Sherman Bausch, 44, a business technology consultant from Lakeville in Dakota County called Trump a “horrible role model\\\" but said he also would be “very, very frustrated” to have to vote for Sanders. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>\\\"I don’t think replacing one guy at one end who’s yelling at everybody with a guy on the other end who’s yelling at everybody is an appropriate move for the country at this point,” he said. He voted for Biden. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Outside of Denver, Andrea Staron, 38, said she used to vote Republican. But she left her presidential choice blank in 2016. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>On Super Tuesday, the law student who is anti-abortion and deeply interested in anti-poverty work voted on Super Tuesday because she wanted to play a role in choosing an opponent to a president she detests.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Sanders has some “very interesting ideas,\\\" she said, but \\\"I want somebody who can beat Trump.”\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>She waited until the last minute. And she voted for Biden. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>__\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Mascaro reported from Washington.

She had a question, but she didn’t want to ask it out loud.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The House majority whip bent down so the 76-year-old Jones could whisper in his ear: “I need to know who you’re going to vote for,” she asked.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Clyburn whispered back, “Joe Biden.”\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Giving Clyburn a thumbs up, Jones wondered if he’d endorse the former vice president publicly.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“I had no idea he was going to do it,” Jones recalled in a telephone interview with The Associated Press from her home in Hopkins, South Carolina, outside the capital city of Columbia.\\u003c/p>\\u003cdiv class=\\\"ad-placeholder\\\">\\u003c/div>\\u003cp>Not only did Clyburn go public with his choice among the sprawling Democratic field, just days ahead of his native South Carolina’s pivotal primary, but he also anonymously credited Jones and their whispered conversation with his choice to do so.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“She said, ‘You don’t have to say it out loud, but just whisper into my ear, who are you going to vote for next Saturday?

He rose through the ranks and became the vote-counting House Democratic whip on Nancy Pelosi’s leadership team, the No. 3 Democrat in Congress as well as its highest-ranking black member. And as Republicans rose to prominence in his native South Carolina, Clyburn’s stature in the state increased among its Democratic contingent.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Political endorsements at times aren’t thought of as carrying significant heft, used by candidates and endorsers alike for a momentary media bounce that quickly fades to another name on a list.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>But the backing of Clyburn seems to have been the endorsement that brought Biden’s candidacy back from the brink following lackluster performances in other early states. It was an awaited signal for many black voters in South Carolina that Biden would be the candidate to stand up for their interests. He scored a blowout margin of victory of nearly 30 points.\\u003c/p>\\u003cdiv class=\\\"ad-placeholder\\\">\\u003c/div>\\u003cp>\\\"In our community, as African Americans, we've always had a history of hearing from people who have been chosen to lead us,” said Antjuan Seawright. “This example of Jim Clyburn is no different.

He ultimately won 64% of the ballots cast by African American voters, also performing strongly with older voters, women, regular churchgoers and moderates and conservatives, according to AP VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of more than 1,400 voters in South Carolina’s Democratic primary.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>AP VoteCast results also showed that about a third of South Carolina Democrats said they made a late decision about their vote. Of those voters, roughly half ultimately supported Biden.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>As the field constricted and candidates dropped out, Biden’s momentum carried him to victories in 10 of 14 Super Tuesday states. In Alabama, where African American voters made up a majority of the Democratic primary electorate, roughly 7 in 10 supported the former vice president, according to AP VoteCast.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Once Clyburn spoke his mind, said another strategist, Democratic voters of all backgrounds who may have been waffling among the remaining moderate choices saw an imperative to unite behind one of them.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“They got their theoretical permission from Jim Clyburn to do what they needed to do, because they realized the importance of this election, and that the only way that we were going to beat Bernie Sanders, in order to beat Donald Trump, was if we all worked together,” said Amanda Loveday, who has formerly served as Clyburn’s spokeswoman and executive director of the South Carolina Democratic Party. “If your ultimate goal is to beat Donald Trump, it’s time to elect someone who’s going to do that.”\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Reflecting recently on that pivotal conversation with Jones, Clyburn said it wasn’t until he had turned to walk away that he realized what she was asking him to do.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“The expression on her face, the look in her eyes when she said it, she just bowled me over with it,” he told The AP. “It was just a combination of stuff.

2018, and strong performances this year could help Democrats recapture the chamber's majority. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Meanwhile, Democrats are trying to protect two U.S. House seats — Matt Cartwright's in northeastern Pennsylvania and Conor Lamb's in suburban Pittsburgh — in districts Trump won in 2016.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Not everyone subscribes to the coattails theory, and Pennsylvania voters have demonstrated a willingness to ticket-split. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Meanwhile, Sanders supporters are showing no signs of surrender on behalf of a candidate they insist will energize throngs of young

And we undid that decision a few days ago so that the testing can take place in a much more accurate and rapid fashion.” — Wednesday at the White House.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: “The last administration asserted FDA jurisdiction over testing and the development of tests like this. ... The president changed that on Saturday so that now, as I spoke to several governors this morning, the states now have the ability to actually conduct the coronavirus test in state labs, university laboratories.” — Wednesday at the White House.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>TRUMP: “And now we have tremendous flexibility. Many, many more sites. Many, many more people. And you couldn’t have had that under the Obama rule, and we ended that rule very quickly.” — Wednesday.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>THE FACTS: They're trying to blame Barack Obama for something his administration didn't do.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>It’s not true that an Obama-era rule limited laboratories run by companies, universities and hospitals from developing and running tests for the coronavirus during an emergency. No such regulation existed.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The Trump administration’s action last Saturday only undid a policy that its own Food and Drug Administration put in place. The new action lets labs develop and use coronavirus diagnostic tests before the agency reviews them. Previously, the FDA had only authorized use of a government test developed by the CDC.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>FDA guidance drafted during the Obama administration called for tighter regulation of so-called laboratory-developed tests, a market traditionally not overseen by the agency. But that guidance was not brought into effect. Even if it had been, it would not have applied to public health emergencies such as the coronavirus.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>___\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>TRUMP: “We're talking about a vaccine.

They say a vaccine is probably more than a year away at best and there are no special treatments for COVID-19. The notion of a quick “cure” is not in their vocabulary as they focus on trying to help people avoid getting the disease in the first place.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>What’s actually happening: Studies have begun in COVID-19 patients in parts of the world to see if certain antiviral medications could help treat the infection. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Today, there are no proven treatments. In China, scientists have been testing a combination of HIV drugs against the new coronavirus, as well as an experimental drug named remdesivir that was in development to fight Ebola. In the U.S., the University of Nebraska Medical Center also began testing remdesivir in some Americans who were found to have COVID-19 after being evacuated from a cruise ship in Japan.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>It's not known how soon such studies will answer whether any of the drugs help.

But the public’s engagement with the president on his favorite social media platform has diminished since his inauguration more than three years ago. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Trump's tweets drew an average of 5.37 likes per 1,000 followers at the start of his presidency and were down to 1.29 in February, according to an analysis by Factba.se, a data analytics company that analyzes spoken and written remarks by elected officials. By comparison, top Democratic presidential contenders Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders — both of whom have a fraction of Trump’s Twitter following — tallied 2.13 and 2.73 likes per 1,000 followers respectively last month.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The falling engagement numbers come as Trump, who likes to use social media as a tool to reach Americans without the contextualizing of the mainstream media, is relying on Twitter more than ever.\\u003c/p>\\u003cdiv class=\\\"ad-placeholder\\\">\\u003c/div>\\u003cp>Trump broke his personal record for most tweets or retweets in a day in January as the Senate began hearing opening arguments in his impeachment trial, sending out more than 140 posts before most Americans had left work for the day. Trump, who was in Switzerland for an economic forum at the time, mostly posted tweets and retweets attacking Democratic House impeachment managers while amplifying messaging from allies who came to his defense.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Brian Ott, a Texas Tech University professor of communications and co-author of “The Twitter Presidency: Donald J.

Most of those who remained until the end seemed to hang on Trump's every word but were far less animated as they sat with their “Promises Kept\\\" and “Women for Trump\\\" signs laying neatly in their laps.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Similar scenes played out at recent rallies in Colorado Springs and Las Vegas. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>In Las Vegas, retirees Jim Haney and wife Theda Haney ran out of steam about nine hours after arriving at the arena and left before Trump finished his speech.

At his rally in Colorado Springs last month, Trump crowed there were “a lot of people, thousands of people that couldn’t get in.” \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Indeed, several dozen people camped overnight in sub-freezing temperatures to attend Trump's recent rally in the military town. Some 2,000 people were turned back after the arena filled to capacity, but most stuck around for a while to watch Trump on a large screen in the parking lot. There were only a couple dozen left by the time he finished, with many shuffling their feet and huddling to ward off the cold.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>For some devoted Trump fans, just getting a small taste of seeing Trump campaign in the flesh is enough.

The former president, who has stayed stridently neutral throughout the primary, had long been a fan of Buttigieg, identifying him as one of the Democratic Party’s next generation of leaders. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Obama congratulated Buttigieg on his campaign and counseled him on a possible endorsement, according to a person with knowledge of the call. Obama didn’t push Buttigieg to endorse a specific candidate, but they talked through factors to consider. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>By Monday morning, Buttigieg was ready to back Biden. His campaign quietly coordinated with Biden’s campaign, which sent a private plane to South Bend to ferry Buttigieg to Dallas for an endorsement event. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>—-\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Sen. Amy Klobuchar was also among the candidates who gathered in Selma. After a surprise third-place finish in New Hampshire and a sudden infusion of cash, her campaign was struggling to keep pace with the campaign’s intense primary calendar. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Klobuchar had spent Sunday morning talking with her own advisers about the path forward. The senator’s home state of Minnesota was among those voting on Super Tuesday, and the campaign’s internal polling showed Klobuchar ahead. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The way Klobuchar saw it, she had two choices: stay in to win Minnesota and relish in the glow of a home state victory, or drop out and help Biden win the state. \\u003c/p>\\u003cdiv class=\\\"hub-link-embed\\\" id=\\\"afs:Content:8622350125\\\">Full Coverage: Election 2020\\u003c/div>\\u003cp>Klobuchar reached her decision in Selma, as she sat inside Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“I was in that church in Selma that morning and I was thinking what is better here? What is better for our country?” she said on NBC’s “Today Show.\\\" Klobuchar privately concluded she needed to step aside. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Still, she hoped for one last rally in her home state before she announced her decision. It wasn’t to be. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Protesters interrupted Klobuchar’s campaign event at a suburban Minneapolis high school, calling on her to drop out over her handling of a 2002 murder case that sent a black 17-year-old to prison for life while she was a county prosecutor. The rally was abruptly canceled.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Klobuchar got back on the campaign’s charter plane and headed to Utah, where she had a morning event scheduled in Salt Lake City. But she left her aides with instructions: Because time was running out before Super Tuesday, she wanted to hold one event to both \\u003ca href=\\\"https://apnews.com/e89217f7f51b3fc3e8433e5427110c56\\\">announce the end of her campaign\\u003c/a> and appear with Biden to declare her support for the former vice president. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Campaign manager Justin Buoen and two other campaign aides started Googling where Biden would be on Monday. He had events in Texas, and a nighttime rally in Dallas seemed the most feasible. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Beyond logistics, there was an added bonus to picking the Dallas event. A joint Biden-Klobuchar rally was all but certain to be carried live on cable television. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>And it was scheduled for the same time Sanders would be holding a rally in Minnesota. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>—-\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>For Biden, the three days between South Carolina and Super Tuesday were dizzying. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The campaign had been running on fumes through the opening months of the year. Disappointing finishes in the opening contests scared off donors, and the campaign’s coffers were running perilously low. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>But Biden appeared more at home in South Carolina, where his family had vacationed for years and where he had deep ties to state officials and voters. Ahead of the primary, he’d secured the endorsement of Rep. James Clyburn, the highest-ranking African American in Congress, whose backing for Biden had come with a dose of tough love about the ways the campaign needed to improve if Biden had any hope of securing the nomination. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Heading into the Saturday primary, Biden’s campaign was hoping to pull out a win with a margin of victory in the double digits. Biden went on to carry the state by 30 points. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“This is the night Bernie Sanders began to unravel,” Dick Harpootlian, a South Carolina state senator and longtime Biden backer, said at the victory party that night. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>At campaign headquarters in Philadelphia, phones began to ring. Establishment Democrats who had held off endorsing and donors who had been sitting on the sidelines were suddenly expressing interest.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>One of the centrist Democrats who had backed Biden in the lead-up to South Carolina was Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, whose state was among those voting on Super Tuesday. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>When Kaine first announced his endorsement and appeared with Biden, he sensed that many voters in Virginia were still undecided. But the morning after Biden’s South Carolina win, Kaine said the shift in his state was palpable. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“I had people just coming up to me saying, ‘Hey, I saw that, I’m really glad you did that,’” Kaine said. “People were deciding late, and they were looking for how to figure this out.”\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>On Super Tuesday, Biden’s margin of victory in Virginia was about as large as it was in South Carolina. His campaign had just one office in the state and had spent less than $200,000 on television advertising compared with $12 million for Bloomberg. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>——\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>By the next morning, \\u003ca href=\\\"https://apnews.com/4b7a6e2de46b8d9594a55833f8061094\\\">Bloomberg, too, would be out\\u003c/a> of the race. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>He’d plunged more than a half-billion dollars into his primary campaign, but failed to win a single state. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Bloomberg’s path to the nomination was always contingent on a Biden collapse, and for weeks, the polling the data-driven billionaire consumed backed up that bet. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>But Bloomberg’s own favorable ratings took a serious tumble in the campaign’s internal polling after a poor debate performance in February in which Sen. Elizabeth Warren and others berated him for the stop-and-frisk policy he oversaw as mayor of New York and his company’s non-disclosure agreements with dozens of women. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>After South Carolina, the campaign’s polling showed the race was rapidly shifting away from Bloomberg. With no financial restrictions, and significant resources already spent, the campaign decided to press forward to Super Tuesday with a long-shot hope of overperforming. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>By night’s end, Bloomberg wasn’t close to contention for any of the 14 states. Biden won in Minnesota, in Texas, in Massachusetts — all states where he had a scant campaign operation and little advertising on the air. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The former mayor arrived at his midtown campaign headquarters by about 8 a.m. Wednesday for one last look at the data. He concluded that he, too, was getting out and endorsing Biden. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>—-\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>AP writers Bill Barrow in Atlanta and Kathleen Ronayne in Sacramento, California, contributed to this report. \\u003c/p>\",\"mediaCount\":2,\"shortId\":\"fa7b7cc4c7d2b55cb5cdcd3567167e9e\",\"localLinkUrl\":\"https://apnews.com/fa7b7cc4c7d2b55cb5cdcd3567167e9e\",\"interactiveLinkUrl\":null,\"mediumIds\":[\"e0e5a65ab8ab4edca2c95ee16ea146f8\",\"b3fef638890b413e8d5aec51740b862a\"],\"interactiveLinkUrlText\":null,\"richEmbeds\":[{\"leadHubLink\":true,\"displayName\":\"Full Coverage:\",\"calloutText\":\"Election 2020\",\"tag\":{\"name\":\"Election 2020\",\"id\":\"Election2020\"},\"type\":\"Hub Link\",\"id\":\"afs:Content:8622350125\"}],\"leadVideoId\":null,\"updated\":\"2020-03-07 05:03:22\",\"id\":\"urn:publicid:ap.org:fa7b7cc4c7d2b55cb5cdcd3567167e9e\",\"media\":[],\"videoContext\":\"lead\\u003c/a> in the all-important delegate count. \\u003c/p>\",\"tagIds\":[\"apf-topnews\",\"apf-GeneralNews\",\"apf-politics\",\"JoeBiden\",\"Campaigns\",\"Election2020\",\"SouthCarolina\",\"WeekendReads\"],\"hasTextOverlay\":false,\"bylines\":\"By JULIE PACE, THOMAS BEAUMONT and SARA BURNETT\",\"leadPhotoId\":\"e0e5a65ab8ab4edca2c95ee16ea146f8\"}],\"notificationUrl\":null,\"textColor\":\"#000000\",\"teamLimit\":25,\"cardType\":\"Wire Story\",\"notificationText\":null,\"sponsorUrl\":null},{\"feed\":[],\"pollUpdated\":null,\"headlineWidget\":false,\"dividerColor\":null,\"tagObjs\":[],\"sponsorImageUrl\":null,\"hubPeekLinkText\":null,\"borderColor\":null,\"cardTitle\":null,\"localMemberName\":null,\"notificationUpdated\":null,\"collectionTagObjs\":[],\"notificationTitle\":null,\"minimizedStoryCount\":null,\"shortId\":\"0ff43541a6fc024c3217478d5d062919\",\"allowAd\":true,\"pollWeek\":null,\"disclaimerText\":null,\"teams\":null,\"hubPeekTagName\":null,\"sponsorAttribution\":null,\"textScale\":null,\"expandedStoryCount\":null,\"hubPeekTagId\":null,\"id\":\"urn:publicid:ap.org:0ff43541a6fc024c3217478d5d062919\",\"pollId\":null,\"contents\":[{\"embedHeight\":null,\"contentSponsor\":null,\"tagObjs\":[{\"id\":\"apf-topnews\",\"name\":\"AP Top News\",\"order\":8},{\"id\":\"apf-GeneralNews\",\"name\":\"General News\",\"order\":0},{\"id\":\"apf-politics\",\"name\":\"Politics\",\"order\":10},{\"id\":\"JoeBiden\",\"name\":\"Joe Biden\",\"order\":0},{\"id\":\"Election2020\",\"name\":\"Election 2020\",\"order\":0},{\"id\":\"BernieSanders\",\"name\":\"Bernie Sanders\",\"order\":0},{\"id\":\"Alabama\",\"name\":\"Alabama\",\"order\":0},{\"id\":\"SuperTuesday\",\"name\":\"Super Tuesday\",\"order\":0}],\"title\":\"US--Election 2020-Super Tuesday\",\"localMemberName\":null,\"contentType\":\"text\",\"layoutType\":\"Small Photo\",\"embedCaption\":null,\"gcsUrl\":\"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/contents/urn:publicid:ap.org:0ff43541a6fc024c3217478d5d062919\",\"embedLinkURL\":null,\"language\":null,\"headline\":\"One more victory: Biden wins most Super Tuesday delegates\",\"firstWords\":\"\\u003cp>WASHINGTON (AP) — Former Vice President Joe Biden has put an exclamation point on his Super Tuesday victories by winning the most delegates on the presidential primary calendar's biggest...\\u003c/p>\",\"published\":\"2020-03-07 00:14:21\",\"embedHTML\":null,\"sequenceNumber\":null,\"notificationId\":null,\"storyHTML\":\"\\u003cp>WASHINGTON (AP) — Former Vice President Joe Biden has put an exclamation point on his Super Tuesday victories by winning the most delegates on the presidential primary calendar's biggest night.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The Associated Press has allocated more than 92% of the 1,344 delegates that were up for grabs on Tuesday, and Biden has such a commanding lead that Vermont Sen.

But the timing — as his administration was already facing criticism over its handling of the outbreak — threatened to exacerbate concerns about the government's ability to protect the nation from a virus that \\u003ca href=\\\"https://apnews.com/6f3367302dff66b9bfb335830b5ed74d\\\">has now infected\\u003c/a> more than 100,000 people worldwide.

Indeed, Trump had been eyeing the change for many months, according to people familiar with his thinking, but wanted to wait until after the impeachment saga was over to make his move. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Meadows, the onetime leader of the House Freedom Caucus, is a longtime Trump confidant and sounding board, whose political instincts Trump respects. He announced last year that he would not be seeking reelection for his North Carolina House seat, and said he expected to join Trump's team in some capacity, though it was not clear in what role. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>He was officially offered the job Thursday, according to one of the people familiar with the matter, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the changes publicly. Mulvaney was informed Friday.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Some outside advisers had cautioned Trump that making such a high-profile switch during the coronavirus crisis would rattle markets craving stability, and his decision to make the announcement after Wall Street had closed Friday was partly informed by those concerns, the people said. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>First elected in the post-Tea Party wave of 2012, Meadows quickly established himself as a leader of a new generation of conservative Republicans on Capitol Hill. He served as chairman of the unyielding Freedom Caucus, and his antics in the House helped spur Speaker John Boehner’s sudden retirement.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>As Trump ascended in 2016, Meadows switched from his earlier backing of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and — urged on by his wife — joined the Trump train. Since then he has proven himself an unwavering Trump ally.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>A skilled negotiator, Meadows is seen as both a leader and an outlier among Republicans on Capitol Hill. Meadows was central to talks on the failed effort to repeal Obamacare and pass the GOP tax cuts. But in many ways, he remains his own counsel, with a skill set and status that may serve him well in Trump's White House.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Meadows has also made clear to the White House and those close to the president that he has no plans to try to rein in Trump, as others — like Mulvaney's predecessor, retired four-star Gen. John Kelly — have tried and failed to do.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Having seen how Kelly’s efforts to impose military order had grated on Trump and antagonized outside allies, Mulvaney, a former congressman from South Carolina, took a laissez-faire approach, making clear he believed his job was to manage the staff and not the president.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>He adopted the “Let Trump be Trump” mantra that had served others in Trump’s orbit well and focused instead on trying to boost staff morale and wooing lawmakers at the Camp David presidential retreat. But while he never irritated Trump and outside allies, Mulvaney had been relegated to the sidelines even before a disastrous mid-October press conference in which he insisted quid pro quo was normal when it came to foreign policy, undercutting the president’s position that there was no such thing in his dealings with Ukraine.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Still, his allies had repeatedly brushed off rumblings of his imminent departure and had said as recently as last month that he planned to stay at least through the election in November.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Trump had other plans. Ever since he was acquitted by the Senate on the impeachment charges, Trump has \\u003ca href=\\\"https://apnews.com/504e331eeec5107afbe757e8d241a16d\\\">been on a tear\\u003c/a> to rid his administration of those he deems insufficiently loyal.

Indeed, they said Mulvaney had raised the idea of Meadows as chief of staff before Trump had tapped Mulaney for the job, and said he discussed the plan with Trump following his trip to India last week.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>___\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Lemire reported from New York.

Biden will increase Social Security benefits and protect it for generations to come,” a narrator intones, before turning the matter back on Sanders. “Negative ads will only help Donald Trump. It’s time we bring our party together.” \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>A Sanders ad airing in upcoming primary states features Senate audio from a 1990s debate on a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution. Biden, then a Delaware senator, talks of his work on long-term budget deals that could have curbed some entitlement spending. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The second Biden ad, “Service,” features video of Obama awarding Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom shortly before the pair ended their second terms in national office. “Joe’s candid, honest counsel made me a better president and a better commander in chief,” Obama says in the video, touting Biden’s various roles in his administration. “All of this makes him the finest vice president we have ever seen. The best part is he’s nowhere close to finished.”\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Obama has been a shadow throughout the 2020 contest, with Biden invoking their relationship regularly as he campaigns. Other candidates alternated between criticizing part of the Obama record, such as when Julian Castro hammered Biden in an early debate over Obama-era deportations, and embracing Obama, as billionaire Mike Bloomberg did in his ubiquitous television advertising campaign. Biden expressed frustration at both tacks, defending Obama’s record and noting that his old boss was staying out of the primary and not endorsing anyone.\\u003c/p>\\u003cdiv class=\\\"ad-placeholder\\\">\\u003c/div>\\u003cp>While that may be the case, Obama has crept back in recently. The former president called Biden to congratulate him on his South Carolina victory Feb. 29, a source with knowledge of the conversation confirmed. With neither Obama or Biden disputing that account, some observers read it as the former president tacit nod toward his vice president as the field winnowed. Sources also confirm that Obama has seen the ad using clips from Biden’s White House medal ceremony. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Separately, Biden has in recent weeks reminded voters that Sanders, a democratic socialist well to Obama’s left, once floated the idea of a primary campaign against the president in his 2012 re-election year. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Still, Social Security may promise to be the bigger fight between Biden and Sanders in the coming weeks. Some Sanders aides have for months surfaced various comments and votes from Biden over the years on entitlement spending, without acknowledging that Sanders himself in the 1990s expressed openness to Social Security “adjustments,” a word that some Sanders allies argued Biden and others used as a euphemism for cuts. Then a representative from Vermont, Sanders also praised an overhaul of the popular safety net program that reduced benefits and increased some taxes under President Ronald Reagan, a Republican. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>As presidential candidates in 2020, Sanders and Biden each have proposed protecting and expanding Social Security, so it’s not clear whether either candidate will be able to capitalize on the matter.

And he falsely claimed that a test for the virus was available immediately to all who want it.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>He also suggested the accuracy of the coronavirus test was “perfect — like the letter was perfect.\\\" With that, Trump was making a comparison to the July phone call with Ukraine's president that led to his impeachment.

Our numbers are lower than just about anybody,\\\" Trump said about cases of the virus.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>But his messaging was more scattered at the CDC, reflective of the on-again, off-again, on-again nature of the trip itself. The White House had announced early Friday that Trump's trip to the CDC was canceled because of concern about a possible infection there, but that person tested negative and Trump ended up going after all.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>During his visit to the CDC, Trump touted the ratings of his town hall this week on Fox News and mocked a CNN reporter. He cut off Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar as he tried to counsel Americans to be patient. And despite calling this week for bipartisanship during the crisis, Trump said he told Vice President Mike Pence not to be complimentary during his Thursday meeting with Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington because “he is a snake.”\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“So I told Mike not to be complimentary of the governor because that governor is a snake, OK? Inslee. I said, 'If you’re nice to him he will take advantage.' And I would have said no. Let me just tell you: We have a lot of problems with the governor, the governor of Washington. ... So Mike may be happy with him but I’m not.”\\u003c/p>\\u003cdiv class=\\\"ad-placeholder\\\">\\u003c/div>\\u003cp>Trump also insisted that for those concerned about the virus, “Anybody who wants a test, can get a test.\\\"\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Pence, who chairs the federal coronavirus task force, at a later briefing suggested a timeline of “weeks” before the test would be widely available to the general public.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Pence was also asked whether Trump's comments about Inslee and impeachment raised questions about how seriously the president was taking the virus. The vice president responded, \\\"I promise you, President Trump has no higher priority than the health and safety of the American people.\\\" \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Inslee tweeted his own response to Trump's comments: ”It's important for leaders to speak with one voice. I just wish the president and vice president could get on the same page.\\\"\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Trump also said he talked on the phone with California Gov. Gavin Newsom about the 3,500 people stuck on a cruise ship anchored off the coast of California. He said he'd prefer for the passengers to remain on the ship — in part so they would not count against the total number of victims in the United States. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“I don't need to have the numbers double because of the people on that ship,” he said. Trump did say he would defer to the medical experts and Pence later said the ship would be brought to a U.S. port.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The legislation Trump signed at the White House provides federal public health agencies with money for vaccines, tests and potential treatments and helps state and local governments prepare and respond to the threat. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>\\\"It's an unforeseen problem,\\\" Trump said of the virus. “It came out of nowhere. We're taking care of it.”\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The president, while touring the CDC, talked up his ability to understand the virus, although he has repeatedly misstated how long it would take for a vaccine to be developed and available.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“I like this stuff.

That pales in comparison with Michigan's 125, Washington's 89 or Missouri's 68. As a result, North Dakota hasn't gotten much attention from either candidate. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>What's new for North Dakota voters in 2020 is that the system is \\u003ca href=\\\"https://apnews.com/0ed5acec2ebeec4e933c18de372a4865\\\"> more like a primary \\u003c/a> than a traditional caucus. People are free to vote and leave. Democrats can vote at 14 locations across the state, from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. CST and 10 a.m. to 6 pm. MST. Republicans will have seven polling places open from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. local time, where voters can express their support for President Donald Trump .\\u003c/p>\\u003cdiv class=\\\"ad-placeholder\\\">\\u003c/div>\\u003cp>And in a boon to rural voters, mail-in ballots will be accepted. Alex Rohr, spokesman for the state Democratic party, said about 3,100 mail-in ballots were requested, though the number returned won't be counted until Tuesday night. Fewer than 3,400 people voted in the Democratic caucus in 2016, so turnout is expected to be much higher this time.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“I think North Dakota has a chance to weigh in and really send a message to the rest of the country,” Rohr said. “It is a really big opportunity for North Dakota Democrats, liberals, progressives or anyone else who is thinking about voting in the primary.\\\"\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Sanders supporters hope their grass-roots organizing leads to a repeat of his caucus victory from 2016.

Amy Klobuchar from Minnesota — would make a difference for the former vice president. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“What I’m really encouraging is people to weigh in,” Heitkamp said. “Even though North Dakota Democrats frequently believe they’re not the most relevant vote in the country as it relates to Democratic politics, it can really make a difference this time around.”\\u003c/p>\\u003cdiv class=\\\"ad-placeholder\\\">\\u003c/div>\\u003cp>Heitkamp, who previously had endorsed Klobuchar, noted that Biden appeared twice in North Dakota to support her unsuccessful re-election bid in 2018, and drew big crowds each time. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“I expect Vice President Biden will do very well,” she said.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Biden also has the endorsement of North Dakota House Minority Leader Josh Boschee, of Fargo, the first openly gay person elected to the Legislature, who had been supporting Pete Buttigieg.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“When I look at the landscape of North Dakota, I think at this point most North Dakotans are going to support Joe Biden” in the caucus, Boschee said. “Senator Sanders still has strong support from his base but hasn't been able to grow his coalition like Joe did.” \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The Vermont senator is counting on his “tons and tons and tons of volunteers” in North Dakota, said his campaign's state co-chair, Zac Echola, of Fargo. They've already been canvassing, phone-banking and reaching out to people one-on-one, he said. And they'll be making a big push this weekend.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“The Bernie campaign is really driven by passionate volunteers, and that's not just in North Dakota, it's everywhere,” Echola said.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>One of those Sanders volunteers is Rep.

Death rates are higher among older patients, while younger people are more likely to get a milder form of the illness.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>To be clear, seniors who suspect they may have COVID-19 — the illness caused by the coronavirus — will still have to get tested physically, whether at a clinic or their doctor's office. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Telemedicine cannot take the place of a swab of the throat to collect a sample for scientific testing. But it can help doctors make special arrangements to safely receive a patient who is sick and suspects the virus may be involved.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Perhaps even more important, telemedicine would offer a way for Medicare recipients in outbreak areas to take care of ongoing medical issues without having to go to the doctor's office and risk coming into contact with someone who is sick. Many seniors have several doctors' appointments every month. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Like the rest of the $8.3 billion coronavirus response bill, the telemedicine provisions were the result of a bipartisan effort by Democratic and Republican lawmakers in both chambers of Congress.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>“This will give seniors greater access to their health care providers without leaving home,” said Sen.

Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, who also worked on the provision.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Medicare is the government's flagship health insurance program, covering about 60 million people age 65 and over, as well as younger people who qualify because of a disability.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Medicare Advantage plans offered by private insurers have been allowed to offer telemedicine as a supplemental benefit like dental coverage or a gym membership for several years now, said Gretchen Jacobson, vice president for Medicare at the Commonwealth Fund think tank. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The new telemedicine waivers would most benefit the roughly two-thirds of Medicare recipients in the traditional program.\\u003c/p>\\u003cp> Overall, telemedicine has grown steadily in recent years. Most mid-size or large employers now offer some way to connect patients and health care providers virtually. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>But researchers say patients have been relatively slow to try telemedicine, especially if they are used to in-person visits. \\u003c/p>\\u003cp>The benefits consultant Mercer found that 88% of companies with 500 or more employees offered telemedicine as part of their health benefits last year.
